      "LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children\u2019s books including classics like \u201cEat Peach Pear Plum\u201d and \u201cThe Jolly Postman,\u201d has died, his publisher said Friday. He was 87.",
      "Penguin Random House said Ahlberg died on Tuesday. It did not give a cause of death.",
      "Ahlberg\u2019s books introduced generations of young children to reading through simple rhymes, sharp observation and gentle humor. Many were co-created with his illustrator wife Janet Ahlberg, who died in 1994.",
      "\u201cPeepo!\u201d (1981) gave a baby\u2019s-eye-view of the world and was interactive in a delightfully analogue way, with peep-holes in the pages to spy the next scenes.",
      "\u201cThe Jolly Postman\u201d (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it \u201cpushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.\u201d",
      "Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including \u201cThe Ha Ha Bonk Book,\u201d and poetry for primary school-age children, including \u201cPlease Mrs. Butler\u201d and \u201cHeard it in the Playground.\u201d",
      "Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a \u201cpostman, plumber\u2019s mate and grave digger,\u201d according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. He met Janet at teacher training college and the couple\u2019s first book, \u201cHere are the Brick Street Boys,\u201d was published in 1975.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs could face a prison sentence \u201csubstantially higher\u201d than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.",
      "They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.",
      "In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.",
      "Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range \u201cwill be substantially higher,\u201d raising the risk Combs will flee.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.",
      "On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.",
      "Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \u201clack of danger to any person or the community.\u201d But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.",
      "In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.",

      "Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.",
      "Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.",
      "\u201cThe defendant's extensive history of violence \u2014 and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct \u2014 demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.\u201d",

That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "In June, Rapp served as a grand marshal of the World Pride parade in Washington, D.C., alongside Laverne Cox and Deacon Maccubbin. \u201cIt can be difficult to feel resilient and empowered as a queer person,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cBecause World Pride was in D.C., I was like, well, I can\u2019t not be there.\u201d She recalled a conversation with Cox, who dispelled some of Rapp's fears of coming off as self-important in the role by emphasizing the power of showing up, and showing face. \u201cRight now, when everything is so under attack, which it pretty much always is, it feels like that\u2019s the time to be really loud.\u201d",
      "Rapp will launch the North American leg of her \u201cBite Me\u201d tour at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheater in September before making stops at New York's Madison Square Garden and as a headliner at the Toronto stop of the All Things Go Festival. She'll tour Europe in March.",
      "As she readies for fans to hear the album, she hopes it offers them some reprieve. \u201cI hope that the weight of the world doesn\u2019t feel as massive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to obsess over everything and be constantly lost in your head.\u201d",
      "Giving them a glimpse into hers, she hopes, is empowering \u2014 and fun: \u201cIt\u2019s just, it feels like a big party that like everybody wants in on.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\u201d",
      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",
      "Shalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle's \u201cgenes\u201d versus \u201cjeans\u201d because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty.",
      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",

      "Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.",
      "\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.",
      "American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.",
      "The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",
      "\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \"But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\"",
      "Melissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the \u201csake of the brand.\u201d",
      "Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.",
      "\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Fans of the Grateful Dead are pouring into San Francisco for three days of concerts and festivities marking the 60th anniversary of the scruffy jam band that came to embody a city where people wore flowers in their hair and made love, not war.",
      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",
      "Certainly, times have changed.",
      "A general admissions ticket for all three days is $635 \u2014 a shock for many longtime fans who remember when a joint cost more than a Dead concert ticket.",
      "But Deadhead David Aberdeen is thrilled anyway.",
      "\u201cThis is the spiritual home of the Grateful Dead,\u201d said Aberdeen, who works at Amoeba Music in the bohemian, flower-powered Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \u201cIt seems very right to me that they celebrate it in this way.\u201d",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. But new Deadheads kept cropping up \u2014 even after iconic guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia \u2019s 1995 death \u2014 aided by cover bands and offshoots like Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cThere are 18-year-olds who were obviously not even a twinkle in somebody\u2019s eyes when Jerry died, and these 18-year-olds get the values of Deadheads,\u201d said former Grateful Dead publicist and author Dennis McNally.",
      "Deadheads can reel off why and how, and the moment they fell in love with the music. Fans love that no two shows are the same; the band plays different songs each time. They also embrace the community that comes with a Dead show.",
      "Sunshine Powers didn\u2019t have friends until age 13, when she stepped off a city bus and into the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.",
      "\u201cI, all of a sudden, felt like I fit in. Or like I didn\u2019t have to fit in,\u201d says Powers, now 45 and the owner of tie-dye emporium Love on Haight. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one it was, but I know it was like, OK.\"",
      "Similarly, her friend Taylor Swope, 47, survived a tough freshman year at a new school with the help of a Grateful Dead mixtape. The owner of the Little Hippie gift shop is driving from Brooklyn, New York, to sell merchandise, reconnect with friends and see the shows.",
      "\u201cThe sense of, \u2018I found my people, I didn\u2019t fit in anywhere else and then I found this, and I felt at home.\u2019 So that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d she said of the allure.",
      "Sometimes, becoming a Deadhead is a process.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to relax rules aimed at reducing auto tailpipe emissions",
      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it \u201cgives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\u201d Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits.",
      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",
      "It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.",
      "EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.",
      "\u201cAutomakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won\u2019t abandon their EV development efforts,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. \"But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.\u201d",

      "U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the proportion of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the share of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to federal data posted Thursday.",
      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",

      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",

      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \u201cno brainer\u201d way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\u201d",

      "A group of more than 20 states are suing the Trump administration over efforts to cut Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis attack isn't just about abortion,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cIt's about denying vulnerable communities access to care they rely on every day.\u201d",
      "But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, named a defendant in the suit, defended the provision.",
      "\u201cStates should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care,\u201d spokesperson Andrew G. Nixon said in an email. \u201cIt is a shame that these democrat attorney generals seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability.\u201d",
      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. Planned Parenthood said although it is not specifically named in the law, the provision was meant to affect its nearly 600 centers in 48 states. About a third of those clinics risk closure because of the legislation, which would strip care from more than 1 million patients, the group argues.",
      "A federal judge on Monday ruled Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to receive Medicaid reimbursements.",

      "The states' suit filed Tuesday argues that by pushing Planned Parenthood clinics to close or cut services, it could increase the states' medical care costs in the long term. Otherwise the cuts will make states use their own funds to keep health centers open.",
      "\u201cEither we have to comply and violate Planned Parenthood\u2019s constitutional rights and then push people to alternative providers that don\u2019t exist, who don\u2019t have the capacity to pick up the slack, or we have to spend upwards of $6 million or more to cover (those services),\u201d said William Tong, Connecticut's Democratic attorney general.",
      "Federal law already bars taxpayer money from covering most abortions, but some conservatives argue abortion providers use Medicaid money for other health services to subsidize abortion.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",
      "The challenge is finding substitutes that will still appeal to children, Miller said.",
      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",
      "In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was \u201creally good.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad \u201cdid not want to be a distraction\u201d and was stepping down from his role as the FDA\u2019s top vaccine regulator \u201cto spend more time with his family,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday.",
      "Two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Prasad was ousted following several recent controversies. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.",
      "Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA\u2019s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "That approach is at odds with Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, who generally favor speedier approvals and unfettered access to experimental treatments.

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly fired the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, accusing them of being too closely aligned with manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. He handpicked replacements that include several vaccine skeptics.",

      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June. It featured a presentation by an anti-vaccine advocate that warned of dangers about a preservative used in a few flu vaccines, but the committee members didn't hear from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers about an analysis that concluded there was no link between the preservative and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen.

      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",

And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division.

      "A United Nations report highlights rising food insecurity in Africa, with over 1 billion people unable to afford a healthy diet in 2024",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion \u2014 some two-thirds of the continent's population \u2014 in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday.",
      "The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don\u2019t reach that mark, the report said.",
      "The annual report, produced by five U.N. agencies, analyzes trends in efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger around the world by 2030. Those agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.",
      "An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that \u201ccontrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa\u201d and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said.",
      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe must urgently reverse this trajectory,\u201d said M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist with the FAO.",
      "A major mark of distress is the number of Africans unable to afford a healthy diet. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period.",
      "That means the vast majority of Africans are unable to eat well on the continent of 1.5 billion people.",
      "The U.N. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks \u2014 in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance \u2014 were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 \u201chunger hot spots.\u201d",

      "Torero, the FAO chief economist, said the situation in Africa is \u201cconcerning,\u201d driven in part by the failure of agricultural production to keep up with population growth in many areas.",
      "At the same time, he said, many parts of Africa face violent conflict and setbacks stemming from climate change.",
      "\u201cThese shocks interact and reinforce each other, weakening already fragile agrifood systems,\u201d he said, speaking about the latest U.N. report. \u201cConflict zones such as Sudan and the Sahel face particularly acute challenges. Additionally, climate poses a serious threat, particularly to the most vulnerable populations.\u201d",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "The authors of the study said that is why it is crucial to monitor ex-POWs and give them specialized medical and psychological care as they age.",
      "That logic rings true to Denys Zalizko, a 21-year-old former POW who has been back in Ukraine for less than three months but is already sure his recovery will take a long time.",

      "Zalizko said he survived torture, suicide attempts and relentless beatings during roughly 15 months in Russian captivity.",
      "The first time his mother, Maria Zalizko, saw him after his release, she barely recognized him. He was thin and appeared \u201cbroken,\u201d she said, with torment in his eyes.",
      "Zalizko's physical appearance is now almost completely different. His skin looks healthy, his muscles are taut and he has lots of energy. But still there is sadness in his eyes.",

      "\u201cPauses and stillness bring anxiety,\u201d says Zalizko.",
      "Like Tarnavskyi, he is receiving mandatory counseling at the Lisova Polyana mental health center. And like many former POWs, he still battles hypervigilance \u2014 listening for threats, scanning his surroundings. At night, sleep comes in fragments, and that was true even before a recent uptick in nightly drone attacks by the Russian army.",
      "For the families of POWs, the reintegration process is also a struggle.",
      "A psychologist advised Maria Zalizko to give her son space, to avoid calling him too often. But it is Denys who often calls her, sometimes singing over the phone \u2014 a skill she taught him as a child.",
      "\u201cI love music. Music unites,\u201d he said, touching the tattoo of a treble clef behind his ear \u2014 inked after his return. Even in captivity, he sang quietly to himself, composing songs in his mind about love, home and war. Now he dreams of turning that passion into a career as an artist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve become stronger now,\u201d Zalizko said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, not afraid of losing an arm or a leg, not afraid of dying instantly. I fear nothing anymore.\u201d",

      "Over the years as the area became more developed, residents began complaining of health problems, including instances of childhood leukemia which they blamed on the electromagnetic waves generated by the towers. The Vatican denied there was any causal link but cut back the transmissions.",
      "Pope Francis last year tasked the Vatican to study developing the area into a vast solar farm, hoping to put into practice his preaching about the need to transition away from fossil fuels and find clean, carbon-neutral energy sources.",
      "Pope Leo XIV visited the site in June and affirmed that he intended to see Francis\u2019 vision through. Leo has strongly taken up Francis' ecological mantle, recently using a new set of prayers and readings inspired by Pope Francis\u2019 environmental legacy.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- FBI Director Kash Patel provoked diplomatic discomfort in New Zealand by suggesting the opening of a new office in the capital aims to counter China\u2019s influence, drawing polite dismissals from Wellington and ire from Beijing.",
      "Patel was in Wellington on Thursday to open the FBI\u2019s first standalone office in New Zealand and to meet senior officials. The arrangement aligns New Zealand with FBI missions in other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations, which also include the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.",
      "The Wellington office will provide a local mission for FBI staff who have operated with oversight from Canberra, Australia, since 2017.",
      "In remarks made in a video published Thursday by the U.S. Embassy, Patel said the office would help counter Chinese Communist Party influence in the contested South Pacific Ocean.",
      "New Zealand ministers who met Patel, the highest-ranking Trump administration official to visit New Zealand, quietly dismissed his claims. A government statement Thursday emphasized joint efforts against crimes such as online child exploitation and drug smuggling, with no mention of China.",
      "\u201cWhen we were talking, we never raised that issue,\u201d Foreign Minister Winston said Thursday.",
      "Judith Collins, minister for the security services, said the focus would be on transnational crime.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t respond to other people\u2019s press releases,\u201d she said when reporters noted Patel had mentioned China, Radio New Zealand reported.",
      "Trade Minister Todd McClay rejected a reporter\u2019s suggestion Friday that Wellington had \u201ccelebrated\u201d the office opening.",
      "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it was celebrated yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there was an announcement and it was discussed.\u201d",
      "At a briefing Friday, Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun denounced Patel\u2019s remarks",
      "\u201cChina believes that cooperation between countries should not target any third party,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeking so-called absolute security through forming small groupings under the banner of countering China does not help keep the Asia Pacific and the world at large peaceful and stable.\u201d",
      "New Zealand, the smallest Five Eyes partner, has faced ongoing pressure to align with U.S. stances on China, its largest trading partner, while carefully balancing relations with Beijing. Analysts said the FBI chief's comments could vex those efforts, although New Zealand has faced such challenges before.",

      "The designation is one of the most significant decisions of Leo's young papacy and also carries deep personal meaning: Newman was strongly influenced by St. Augustine of Hippo, the inspiration of Leo's Augustinian religious order.",
      "The title of doctor is reserved for people whose writings have greatly served the universal church. Only three-dozen people have been given the title over the course of the church's 2,000-year history, including St. Augustine, St. Francis de Sales and St. Teresa of Avila.",
      "Newman\u2019s path to being declared a doctor has been exceptionally quick, after Pope Benedict XVI beatified him during a visit to Britain in 2010. Pope Francis made him a saint in 2019, with then-Prince Charles in attendance.",
      "Newman, a theologian and poet, is admired by Catholics and Anglicans alike because he followed his conscience at great personal cost. When he defected from the Church of England to the Catholic Church in 1845, he lost friends, work and even family ties, believing the truth he was searching for could only be found in the Catholic faith.",

As a Catholic, he became one of the most influential theologians of the era, bringing elements of the Anglican church into his new faith tradition. He died in Britain in 1890.",

      "The killing of a collared lion involved in a research project in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter has been condemned by wildlife groups",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- The killing of a collared lion involved in a research project in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter has been condemned by wildlife groups, echoing the infamous case of a lion called Cecil whose death at the hands of an American tourist in the same country a decade ago was met with international outrage.",
      "The latest lion, known as Blondie, was part of an Oxford University study and wore a research collar sponsored by Africa Geographic, a safari company. Africa Geographic said Blondie was killed by a hunter in June close to the country's flagship Hwange National Park after being lured out of a protected area and into a nearby hunting zone with the use of bait.",
      "After Blondie's killing became a new rallying cry for those opposed to hunting, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe's National Parks told The Associated Press on Thursday that the hunt was legal and the hunter had the necessary permits. Zimbabwe allows up to 100 lions to be hunted a year. Trophy hunters, who are usually foreign tourists, pay tens of thousands of dollars to kill a lion and take the head or skin as a trophy.",
      "Africa Geographic CEO Simon Espley said Blondie's killing made \u201ca mockery of the ethics\u201d trophy hunters claim to prescribe to because he wore a clearly visible research collar and was a breeding male in his prime. Hunters say they only target ageing, non-breeding lions.",
      "\"That Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d Espley said.",
      "Hunting lions is fiercely divisive, even among conservationists. Some say if it is well managed it raises money that can be put back into conservation. Others want killing wildlife for sport to be banned outright.",
      "Some countries in Africa like Kenya have commercial hunting bans, others like Zimbabwe and South Africa allow it. Botswana lifted a ban on hunting six years ago.",
      "Tinashe Farawo, the spokesperson for the Zimbabwe parks agency, said money from hunting is crucial to support the southern African nation's underfunded conservation efforts. He defended the hunt and said they often happen at night, meaning the collar on Blondie may not have been visible.",
      "He said he had no information on Blondie being lured out of the park with bait \u2014 which is usually a dead animal \u2014 but there \u201cis nothing unethical or illegal about that for anyone who knows how lions are hunted. This is how people hunt.\u201d",

Cecil, whose head and skin were cut off and taken for trophies, was also involved in a research project by Oxford University.",
      "Zimbabwe authorities initially said they would seek to extradite Palmer over the hunt, although that didn't happen, while a hunting guide who helped him was arrested, only for charges to be dropped.",
      "Zimbabwe's national parks agency says the country makes about $20 million a year from trophy hunting, with a single hunter spending an average of $100,000 per hunt \u2014 which includes accommodation and hiring vehicles and local trackers.",
      "Zimbabwe is home to approximately 1,500 wild lions, with around one-third of them living in the vast Hwange National Park. Across Africa, the wild lion population is estimated at around 20,000. However, their numbers are decreasing due to habitat loss and human conflict. Lions, one of Africa's most iconic species, are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",

      "His seizure from his home in the Luhansk region in April 2022 \u2014 weeks after Moscow's full-scale invasion \u2014 was part of a coordinated operation by pro-Russian forces who detained him and two other Ukrainian OSCE workers. Maksym Petrov, an interpreter, also was seized in the Luhansk region, while Vadym Golda, another security assistant, was detained in neighboring Donetsk.",
      "More than three years later, the three Ukrainian civilians who had worked with the international group\u2019s ceasefire monitoring efforts in the eastern regions remain behind bars. They have not been part of recent large-scale prisoner exchanges with Russia.",

      "The OSCE had operated a ceasefire monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists had been fighting Ukrainian government troops since 2014, with about 14,000 killed even before the full-scale invasion. The monitors watched for truce violations, facilitated dialogue and brokered local halts in fighting to enable repairs to critical civilian infrastructure.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "South Dakota rancher Calli Williams wants to benefit from high beef prices, but it's not so simple",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- In a period when retail beef prices are at an all-time high and consumers are still willing to pay, South Dakota rancher Calli Williams would love to cash in. But it's not so simple.",
      "Williams and her husband, Tate, raise about 70 cow-calf pairs near Letcher in southeastern South Dakota, roughly 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Mitchell. They own about 80 acres (32 hectares) and rent additional pasture.",
      "Between the drought that hit cattle country hard over the last few years, still being maxed out on the grass available to feed their animals, and with land prices rising, she said, they simply can\u2019t yet make the financial investments that they\u2019d need to raise production.",
      "\u201cIt is a goal of ours to expand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure if that will be in the 10-year plan or even longer.\u201d",
      "Farmers and ranchers across the U.S. would love to take greater advantage of the high prices, but with the U.S. herd at record lows, they can\u2019t meet the demand quickly. It's basic biology.",
      "\u201cIt takes three years to get more cows \u2014 between making a decision, having that gestation period, having the calf born, raising the calf until it, too, can have a calf,\" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute in Minneapolis.",
      "The Williamses' county was hard hit by drought over the previous few seasons. Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said.",
      "Their area has caught some rain lately, though. It has improved to just \u201cabnormally dry\u201d in recent U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But Williams said they\u2019re simply playing catch-up.",
      "Swanson said some of the main cattle areas in North America \u2014 from Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada down to Texas in the U.S. \u2014 are just naturally prone to drought. It's often boom or bust.",
      "Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, said a lot of cattle country has had good rain this summer, but it's a cyclical business.",
      "\u201cSometimes we have good times, and sometimes we don\u2019t,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cAnd we are just coming off what was a pretty significant negative hit to the cattle industry in \u201919, \u201920 and \u201921, with the height of the pandemic. So we have a lot of producers who are still trying to pay off bills from those times.\"",
      "And Woodall said his members are still leery. They're asking how long the better weather will last.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting some good moisture now. But will it be that way in the fall? Will it be that way next year?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.\u201d",
      "Although it\u2019s difficult to attribute any single weather event, such as a drought, directly to climate change, scientists say that rising temperatures stoked by climate change are increasing the odds of both severe droughts and heavier precipitation, which wreak havoc on people and the environment.",
      "When extreme weather collides with tight margins, farmers and ranchers feel the squeeze.",
      "Retail beef prices have hit record highs with no relief for consumers in sight. Ground beef rose to an average of $6.12 per pound in June, up nearly 12% from 2024. The average price of all steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

      "The total U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it has been at midyear since the government began keeping those figures in 1973, and probably since the 1950s. There were few signs in the U.S. Department of Agriculture data released last Friday that producers have begun rebuilding herds.",
      "As of July 1, the U.S. had 94.2 million cattle and calves, down from the last midyear peak in 2019 of nearly 103 million. Critical for the future supply, 2025 calf production is projected at 33.1 million head, down 1% from last year.",
      "Derrell Peel, a livestock marketing specialist at Oklahoma State University, said if producers were planning to grow their herds, the USDA reports would have shown them keeping heifers \u2014 female cows that haven\u2019t given birth yet.",
      "While retail prices are high, consumers so far have been willing to pay them.",
      "Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University, said taste is the most important consideration when shoppers choose proteins \u2014 and beef remains the favorite.",
      "The late June report found that consumers were willing to fork out $17.62 a pound for rib-eye steaks and $8.82 for a pound of ground beef. That\u2019s more than the $7.13 they\u2019d pay for pork chops, $6.19 for bacon, or $8.55 for chicken breasts.",
      "A major reason, Woodall offered, is that the beef industry has focused on the eating experience.",
      "\u201cThe kind of beef that we are producing today is some of the highest quality, best tasting beef that we\u2019ve ever produced in history here in the United States,\" he said. \u201cSo, things such as USDA prime graded steaks that at one point in time you could only get in a restaurant, you can now get that in a grocery store.\u201d",
      "For consumers who balk at costs, the marketing specialist Peel said, pork and poultry are \u201cabundant and quite favorably priced.\"",
      "The Williamses, who are both 34, built their TW Angus business from scratch. Tate Williams started buying cattle when he was in high school, and they bought their land in 2015. They sell bulls in the spring and keep heifers when they can. They also raise steers in their own feedlot and sell the meat directly to consumers.",
      "\u201cWe would really like to expand our operation,\" Calli Williams said. \"We have a goal of being able to pass this on to the next generation,\u201d Williams said, meaning their sons Jack, 7, and Tommy, nearly 4.",
      "But recalling a friend\u2019s words, she said ranchers are a resilient bunch.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that if Mother Nature \u2014 she wreaked havoc on us, whether that was a drought or a flood \u2014 that next year she\u2019ll be kinder to us, \u201c she said. \u201dOr, if the markets weren\u2019t on our side, we\u2019re optimistic that the markets will be on our side next time.\u201d",

      "Two pubs in London's East End are vying for the title of the city's oldest riverside pub",
      "LONDON -- On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London\u2019s East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads \u201cOldest riverside pub in London.\u201d Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.",
      "The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.",
      "The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city\u2019s crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes \u2014 from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding \u2014 with a side of history.",
      "The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship\u2019s original timbers incorporated into its structure.",
      "Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its \u201cDescendants Book.\u201d",
      "Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital\u2019s modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London\u2019s East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.",
      "In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind.",
      "\u201cThere really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,\" said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.",
      "The Prospect boasts a pewter bar \u2013 the longest of its kind in Britain \u2014 where the infamous \u201cHanging Judge Jeffreys\u201d is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby \u201cExecution Dock.\u201d Early on, the pub was known as the Devil\u2019s Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub\u2019s grisly history.",
      "It \u201cfeels like such a pocket of history in London,\u201d Godwin said. \u201cSo much of London\u2019s East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it\u2019s barely changed.\u201d",
      "British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.",
      "This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.",
      "\u201cWhen a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,\u201d said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA.",
      "Pubs across the country have been forced to find new ways to attract customers.",

      "History is a big draw for pubgoers, with a trip to a traditional British pub coming in high on tourists\u2019 London bucket lists, raising the stakes of the Prospect and the Mayflower\u2019s competition.",
      "The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 \u2014 the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.",
      "Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.",
      "There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called \u201cThe Prospect\u201d rebuilt it using the ship.",
      "\u201cThis rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,\" he said.",
      "If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower \u2014 established in the 16th century \u2014 older.",
      "But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a \u201cloving rivalry.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,\u201d he said.",
      "But the question remains: How can either pub definitively claim the title?",
      "Unlike the title of the \u201cOldest pub in England,\u201d held by the Porch House in southern England, which is said to date to the 10th century, there is no official certification for the oldest pub in London.",
      "Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions.",
      "\u201cThere are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren\u2019t always in \u2018London,\u2019\u201d English historian and author Jacob Field said. \u201cMany pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.\"",

The annual event aims to promote the traditional liquor, which is far less known internationally than whiskey or vodka.",

      "\u201cThen, when I return to China, we must take steps to increase our production of it,\u201d Deng replied, according to an archived document from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Office of the Historian.",
      "Price fluctuations of Feitian Moutai, the liquor\u2019s most famous brand, serve as a barometer for China\u2019s baijiu market. This year, its price has dropped by 36% after four consecutive years of decline, according a report by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association.",
      "The report forecast China\u2019s baijiu production will likely fall for the eighth straight year in 2025. Baijiu consumption has dropped as people spend more cautiously, cutting back on banquets and drinking due to a weaker economy.",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",
      "\u201cCanada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",
      "Many of Canada's exports to the U.S. are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and face no tariff. But steel, lumber, aluminum and autos have been subject to still higher tariffs.",
      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",
      "Neither New Zealand nor its neighbor Australia have struck tariff deals with the Trump administration. Australian steel and aluminum exports have faced a steep 50% tariff since June.",
      "Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the 10% overall tariff on Australia\u2019s exports to the United States was a vindication of his government\u2019s \u201ccool and calm negotiations.\u201d But he said even that level was not justified. The U.S. exports twice as much to Australia as it imports from its bilateral free trade partner, and Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. exports.",
      "Objecting to a 15% tariff rate, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re told the newspaper VG the Scandinavian country should have \u201czero tariffs.\" He said talks were continuing.",
      "Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi was cautious in welcoming Trump's executive order setting Japan\u2019s tariff at 15% after the two sides worked out an agreement, much to Tokyo's relief.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher. The figures are above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.",
      "The uptick in prices helps explain the central bank\u2019s reluctance to cut its key interest rate this week, despite repeated demands from Trump that it do so. On Wednesday, the Fed left its key rate unchanged at 4.3%, and Chair Fed Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the import duties will cause just a one-time rise in prices or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than consistent with the 2% target.",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",

Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year.

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reaction the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism for the American Eagle ad could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The discussion continued after eagle-eyed social media users noticed that Dunkin's promotion for its new summer drink features \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d co-star Gavin Casalengo attributing his suntan to genetics.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",

Gaffney updated the published analysis, which was originally based on the House version of the bill, at the AP\u2019s request.",
      "One study in particular was critical for their work: In 2008, Oregon offered a rare opportunity to compare groups of people enrolled in Medicaid with those who were not.",
      "After a four-year period of frozen enrollment due to budget limitations, the state determined it could enroll 10,000 more people in Medicaid. It used a lottery system to make the selection amid high demand.",

      "The National Transportation Safety Board enters a second day of public hearings Thursday on the January midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger plane that killed all 67 people aboard the aircrafts.",
      "On the first day, investigators highlighted a number of factors that may have contributed to the crash and the warnings about helicopter traffic that FAA received years before the tragedy over the Potomac River.",
      "It\u2019s too early for the board to identify what exactly caused the crash. The board\u2019s final report won\u2019t be released until sometime next year. But it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "The January incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use.",
      "\u201cThis is the very event that this would have been the cautionary note for,\u201d she said.",
      "Video and animation presented during the proceeding's first day showed the helicopter flying above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit before colliding with the plane.",
      "Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn\u2019t exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings.",
      "Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn\u2019t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them.",
      "Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk\u2019s altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet.",
      "The greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such small separation distances between helicopters and planes when planes are landing.",

      "The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.",
      "\u201cAll aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\u201d",
      "Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision.",
      "Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it.",
      "The animation ended with surveillance video showing the helicopter colliding with the plane in a fiery crash.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army\u2019s helicopters routinely flew around the nation\u2019s capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",

      "The biggest event in harness racing celebrates a centennial anniversary this weekend with the 100th running of the Hambletonian",
      "Growing up in a family of horsemen in Ontario, John Campbell knew how prestigious the Hambletonian was. Then he saw good friend Ray Remmen win the first to take place at the Meadowlands in 1981.",
      "\u201cIt was beyond a big deal,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt was something special.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the biggest event in harness racing celebrates a centennial anniversary with the 100th running of Hambletonian. While harness racing, like its thoroughbred equivalent, no longer holds the same prominence it once did in the U.S. sporting landscape, the storied history of the Hambletonian and its evolution to grow interest in Europe are responsible for its longevity.",
      "\u201cTo have this big event still going on 100 years, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t even envision when it was formed,\u201d said Campbell, a Harness Racing Hall of Fame driver who won the Hambletonian a record six times and participated a record 32 consecutive times from 1983-2014. \u201cIt's the consistency of it. They raced it no matter what, through the Depression, through World War II, so it was always there.\u201d",
      "Campbell is now president and CEO of the Hambletonian Society that has shepherded the race named for the founding sire of standardbred horses through changing times. The purse is the sport's richest at $1 million, a long way from the nearly $75,000 on the line during the inaugural rendition in 1926 at the New York State Fair in Syracuse.",
      "The Hambletonian bounced around to Lexington, Kentucky; Goshen, New York and Du Quoin, Illinois, before finding a home in East Rutherford, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cEven during the war, they did have to because of gas rationing take it to Yonkers,\u201d said Tom Charters, who worked at the Hambletonian Society from 1984-2017, including a lengthy stint as president. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the charm of it, I think: the multiple venues and where it\u2019s gone and where it\u2019s been.\u201d",
      "Another charm? The winning horse gets to drink out of the trophy. That is something Charters saw pictures of and made sure would become part of the Hambletonian ceremony \u2014 with the name of the race and the horse logo always facing the cameras.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become as symbolic as drinking milk at Indianapolis, for me, anyway,\u201d Charters said, referring to the Indy 500 tradition.",
      "Campbell has his favorite memories, notably, he said, \u201cWinning.\" His first victory with Mack Lobell in 1987 and winning with Tagliabue\u2014 trained by his brother, Jim, and named after longtime NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue \u2014 in '95 stand out as special, along with 2006 with Glidemaster to revitalize his career after injury.",
      "Chris McErlean, who worked at the Meadowlands from 1992-2007, remembers filly Continentalvictory beating the colts in \u201896, amateur Malvern Burroughs winning with Malabar Man in \u201997 and Swedish owner/trainer/driver Stefan Melander taking the race in 2000 with Scarlet Knight following efforts to encourage European participation.",

      "At its height in 2005, a crowd of 31,000 packed the old Meadowlands \u2014 and the current limit is roughly a third of that.",
      "\u201cHarness racing is a niche kind of regional sport. It has lost ground. Tracks have closed,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cRacing had a wonderful 200-year gambling monopoly that it no longer has, so it has taken a lot of work to keep it prominent and keep it on national TV and keep the big days big.\u201d",
      "Essentially the Kentucky Derby of the harness world, Fanning said the Hambletonian might be the one trotters race known in the mainstream public. Inside the industry, it remains a big deal and something special.",
      "\u201cEven though the sport in general\u2019s been challenged and it maybe is not at the peaks it used to be, the Hambletonian is still the biggest thing, the biggest prize out there,\u201d McErlean said. \u201cIt almost has as much international cache as it does prominence over here because of its longstanding history and being the richest race, being the biggest race on the calendar.\u201d",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A North Carolina judge on Thursday issued a temporary restraining order preventing Rick Ware Racing from selling its NASCAR team to T.J. Puchyr as part of an ongoing legal dispute with Jimmie Johnson-owned Legacy Motor Club.",
      "The order remains in place for 10 days and Legacy is required to post a bond of $5 million by end of business Friday. Rick Ware Racing's attorneys had requested the bond amount be set at $150 million \u2014 the agreed purchase price between RWR and Puchyr, one of the founders of Spire Motorsports who now is a consultant to various race teams and sponsors.",
      "Legacy is suing RWR over a dispute stemming from an agreement that Puchyr brokered for Johnson's race team to purchase one of Ware's two charters. The dispute is over which charter Ware agreed to sell and if the deal is for 2026 or 2027.",
      "A charter is NASCAR's version of a franchise tag and guarantees teams entry into every race, plus monetary assurances. Ware currently uses one of his charters to field a full-time car for his son, Cody, and leases a second charter to RFK Racing.",
      "Before he entered into a deal to sell a charter to Legacy, he already had an agreement with RFK to swap the charters currently in play and lease the other one to RFK in 2026. Then, in 2027, Ware planned to sell a charter outright to Legacy, which has a major investment from Knighthead Capital Management, a private equity firm worth over $13 billion.",

      "Mark Henriques, counsel for Rick Ware Racing, argued both Ware and Puchyr intend to honor any deals but cannot meet the current terms of the charter purchase for 2026 based on the existing deal to lease a charter to RFK next season. RWR and Puchyr have said the plan is to lease to RFK in 2026 and sell to Legacy in 2027; Legacy says if Ware is selling to Puchyr, the charters contractually should be sold to Legacy.",

The top pick in the 2012 amateur draft and 2015 AL Rookie of the Year was part of the homegrown core that helped the Astros go from the league\u2019s laughingstock to perennial contenders.",

      "Correa, who waived his no-trade clause, has exclusively played shortstop in his 11-year major league career, but Brown said he'll move to third base for the AL West leaders with shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a close to returning from the injured list. The Astros need help at third with All-Star Isaac Paredes out indefinitely with a hamstring injury.",
      "\u201cThis guy is a warrior,\u201d Brown said when asked about the position change. \u201cHe\u2019s a team-first guy and we had no doubts knowing the human being and the makeup that he would make that adjustment.\u201d",

      "He left when he became a free agent before the 2022 season when the Astros wouldn\u2019t pay him what he believed he was worth, signing a three-year deal worth just over $105 million. Correa opted out of that contract after one year but re-signed with the Twins on a six-year, $200 million deal.",
      "While Correa\u2019s defense at shortstop has been impeccable and his leadership in the clubhouse strong, the investment for the Twins simply hasn\u2019t panned out. He played the 2023 season through plantar fasciitis in his left foot, batting just .230 with 131 strikeouts in 135 games and a pedestrian .711 OPS.",
      "While the Twins made what was ultimately a cost-cutting move, president of baseball operations Derek Falvey said the genesis for the trade came from the Astros and not from a mandate to further slash the payroll.",
      "\u201cCarlos was never sitting there saying anything about demanding a trade or wanting to do something else. If it was right for the Twins and it was right for him, he was open to the conversation,\u201d Falvey said.",
      "He shined in the playoffs, helping the Twins end a record 18-game postseason losing streak and win a series for the first time in 21 years, and was enjoying an All-Star season in 2024 before plantar fasciitis popped up again \u2014 this time in his right foot. He had to withdraw from the All-Star Game and didn\u2019t return until mid-September, after the Twins were already mired in a sharp swoon that pushed them out of playoff contention.",
      "Correa has been much healthier this year, but not as productive. His .905 OPS in 2024 has fallen to .704 this year, with seven home runs in 93 games.",
      "The contract he signed 2 1/2 years ago now constitutes a much larger percentage of the team\u2019s payroll. The Twins have also seen a sharp decline in regional television revenue in light of the bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group, which prompted a spending reduction by ownership. The Pohlad family has since put the club up for sale.",
      "The Twins will pay what they owe Correa in installments due each Dec. 15: $3 million in 2025 and $10 million each in 2026, 2027 and 2028. Correa is owed $11,419,355 of his $36 million salary this year, $31.5 million next season, $30.5 million in 2027 and $30 million in 2028.",
      "Correa's contract also includes vesting options for the 2029-2032 seasons.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "The Department of Defense now says it will continue sharing key data collected by three sophisticated weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense will now continue sharing key data collected by three weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes. Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",
      "Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",
      "In a notice on Wednesday, officials said there would be no interruption at all.",
      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",
      "The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. It gives crucial information about storms that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional visible or infrared satellites.",

      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program\u2019s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set \u201cin a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to \u201censure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",
      "He added the restoration of the data is also good news for scientists tracking Arctic sea ice loss. Images and microwave satellite data can estimate how much of the ocean is covered by ice, according to NOAA.",

      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

      "Computer software is widely used in music production, and artificial intelligence is just the latest tool that disc jockeys, music producers and others have added to their production pipeline. But the rise of AI song generators such as Suno and Udio is set to transform the industry because they allow anyone to create songs with just a few prompts.",

      "Elon Musk is a kingmaker on X",
      "ROME -- Hard-right commentators, politicians and activists in Europe have uncovered a secret to expanding their influence: engaging with Elon Musk.",
      "Take the German politician from a party whose own domestic intelligence agency has designated as extremist. Her daily audience on X surged from 230,000 to 2.2 million on days Musk interacted with her posts. She went on to lead her party to its best-ever electoral showing.",
      "Or the anti-immigration activist in Britain, who was banned from Twitter and sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. Since Musk let him back on the platform in late 2023, he\u2019s mentioned, reposted or replied to the billionaire more than 120 times on X \u2014 and gained nearly a million followers.",
      "Even a little-known social-media influencer turned politician from Cyprus has benefited from the Musk effect. Before winning a surprise seat in the European Parliament, where he\u2019s advocated for Musk, the influencer seemed to have one ambition: to hug the world\u2019s richest man. He got his hug \u2014 and political endorsements. On days Musk has interacted with his account on X, the man\u2019s audience exploded from just over 300,000 to nearly 10 million views.",
      "Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington -- he stepped down as an adviser to President Donald Trump in May and has since traded insults with the president -- but as he works to build his own political party, his power on X his power remains unchecked.",
      "Musk\u2019s influence on the platform he bought for $44 billion has made him a kingmaker at home and abroad. Among those he has chosen to cultivate are hard-right politicians and insurgent influencers across Europe, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data. His dominance, which has real-world financial and political impacts, is fueling concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China this time, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d said Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation. \u201cWe need to make sure that power is not unbalanced.\u201d",
      "In seeking to quantify Musk\u2019s effect on European politics, The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts over a three-year period from 11 far-right European figures across six countries who frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda and had significant interactions with Elon Musk since he purchased Twitter. Tens of thousands of posts by Musk on Twitter, now known as X, were also collected.",
      "The AP used the records, obtained from data provider Bright Data, to analyze how Musk\u2019s account interacted with the European influencers, and vice versa, and the extent to which Musk\u2019s engagement boosted their reach.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather, they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers who share his views.",
      "Due to limitations on data collection, the dataset is not a complete record of all posts made by these accounts. Even so, it captured at least 920 instances in which one of the European accounts tagged, replied or otherwise attempted to interact with Musk\u2019s account, and at nearly 190 instances where Musk\u2019s own posts interacted with the Europeans.",
      "The AP also analyzed records of daily follower counts, using data from Social Blade, to measure any growth in the European accounts\u2019 audience that occurred in the wake of Musk\u2019s online interactions. This kind of analysis is no longer possible. In March, Social Blade removed X from its analytics, saying that X had increased its data access fees to prohibitive levels, making the platform harder to research.",
      "Among those included in AP\u2019s analysis are several people who have run into legal trouble in their own countries. An anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., for example, was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. A German politician was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech. An Italian vice premier was acquitted in December of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship.",
      "Others examined by AP were an influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right;\u201d a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington, D.C.; and two politicians who have advocated for the interests of Musk\u2019s companies as those firms seek to expand in Europe.",
      "AP\u2019s analysis shows how Musk is helping unite nationalists across borders in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech. While his efforts have sparked backlash in some countries, Musk\u2019s promotion of a growing alliance of hard-right parties and individuals has helped rattle the foundation of a transatlantic bond that has guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Engagement from Musk does not guarantee a surge in followers or page views. But AP found it can have a huge impact, especially on up-and-coming influencers. One account that began with around 120,000 followers when Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 topped 1.2 million by January of this year. Seven other European accounts saw six-figure increases in their follower counts over the same period.",
      "Most of the 11 accounts examined saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers. Even some that grew more steadily on their own before Musk interacted with them saw their follower counts rise sharply after he began engaging with their posts. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, its account saw its views soar \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "Musk is not the only factor influencing the growth of these accounts, of course, but their rising fortunes are a measure of how the platform has evolved under his leadership. When Musk acquired X, he pledged to turn it into a haven for free speech, declaring himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist.\u201d AP\u2019s analysis adds to growing evidence that instead of serving as a neutral forum for free speech, X amplifies Musk\u2019s speech.",
      "This shift has given him sweeping power to direct people\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme asymmetry in the way Musk is able to leverage and shape the platform,\u201d said Timothy Graham, an associate professor in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who has studied data anomalies on X. \u201cThere\u2019s an unequivocal sense when you go onto the site that you\u2019re entering Musk\u2019s kingdom.\u201d",
      "Since he acquired Twitter in 2022, Musk has come to dominate the platform. His followers have more than doubled, to more than 220 million \u2014 growth so tremendous that it easily outpaced the other Top 10 accounts. Not even Taylor Swift has been able to keep up.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose followers grew by 21 million \u2014 or 25% \u2014 from October 2022 through January, clocked a distant second. Donald Trump\u2019s followers grew by 14%, or around 12 million, while Taylor Swift mustered a mere 3% growth, or 3 million new followers.",
      "None of the other Top 10 accounts have shown such consistent follower growth, month after month, AP found. The result is a further concentration of power for the world\u2019s richest man, who now commands the most popular account on a social media platform used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.",
      "Given the opacity of the algorithms that power X, it\u2019s hard to determine with certainty what array of factors might be driving such unusual \u2014 and unusually consistent \u2014 growth in Musk\u2019s account. But researchers who have analyzed data patterns on X argue that the platform\u2019s algorithm has, at times, been altered to amplify Musk\u2019s voice.",
      "How X promotes content is a growing point of contention in Europe. In January, the European Union expanded its investigation of X to assess how the platform pushes content to users and why some material goes viral. In February, French prosecutors opened a separate investigation into X over allegations that Musk changed the platform\u2019s algorithms to promote biased content.",
      "Musk\u2019s public attacks on left-leaning politicians, support for hard-right policies and loose handling of facts have prompted rebukes from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.",
      "X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk\u2019s dominance creates a strong incentive for people seeking to increase their clout \u2014 or their revenues, through the platform\u2019s monetization options \u2014 to exploit these network effects and try to get Musk to engage with their content.",
      "\u201cPeople know that he\u2019s gearing everything towards him,\u201d said Graham, the digital media scholar in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to get close to this person because he is the moneymaker.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, for example, has benefited from the Musk effect. AfD coleader Alice Weidel helped lead the party, which advocates for nationalist and anti-immigrant policies, to second place in German parliamentary elections in February.",
      "When Musk interacted with her account in the run-up to those elections, the average number of daily views she got rose from about 230,000 to 2.2 million.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in May classified Weidel\u2019s party as a right-wing extremist organization, which would subject the AfD to greater surveillance. The party, which maintains that it\u2019s a victim of politically motivated defamation, promptly filed a lawsuit against the move, which Musk, along with top U.S. officials blasted as an attack on free speech. The designation has been suspended pending judicial review.",

      "Since then, Musk has replied to, quoted or tagged Seibt more than 50 times, and her followers have grown by more than 320,000 since Musk took over the platform. On days Musk interacted with Seibt, her posts, on average, got 2.6 times as many views.",

      "Musk has also boosted the influence of political insurgents in the U.K. Days before British national elections last July, Musk took to X to ask Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist Reform U.K. party: \u201cWhy does the media keep calling you far-right? What are your policies?\u201d",
      "Farage replied eagerly: \u201cBecause we believe in family, country and strong borders. Call me!\u201d",

      "In Spain, Rub\u00e9n Pulido, a columnist for a newspaper published by the populist Vox party\u2019s think tank, hit the jackpot in August, when Musk responded to two posts in which he argued that rescue boats operated by nongovernmental organizations effectively help smugglers move migrants to Europe. Pulido\u2019s visibility soared. On days Musk engaged with him, his account got nearly 300,000 views \u2014 roughly three times more than usual.",
      "When Musk didn\u2019t interact with Pulido\u2019s account, the results were just as clear. In January, he again inveighed against migrant rescues and sought to get Musk\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cHi @elonmusk! Speak up,\u201d he urged.",
      "Three weeks later, he tweeted: \u201cPerhaps @elonmusk might find this interesting.\u201d",
      "That post garnered just 5,128 views.",
      "Pulido did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "While Musk helped boost the accounts of such fringe parties and rising influencers, his interactions did not provide as stark a benefit to more established politicians, AP found. That was true for both Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders, an anti-Islamic firebrand who has been called the Dutch Donald Trump.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions online have spilled into political endorsements, policy advocacy -- and money.",
      "X helps users monetize their accounts, through ad revenue sharing and paid subscription programs as well as direct fundraising links. That means a surge in attention on X can bring a surge in revenue.",
      "Tommy Robinson, a British anti-immigration agitator who was released from prison in May, after serving a reduced sentence of seven months for contempt of court, has a link to his fundraising page on his X profile. Interactions from Musk more than doubled Robinson\u2019s daily views, from around 380,000 to nearly 850,000. Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 could not be reached for comment",
      "Radio Genoa, an account reportedly investigated by Italian authorities last year for allegedly spreading hate speech about migrants, used X to publicize a call for a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for legal defense. Radio Genoa has pinged Musk dozens of times over the last three years, and for good reason: On days Musk engaged with him, the views on his account doubled. Radio Genoa\u2019s followers surged from less than 200,000 before Musk\u2019s engagement to over 1.2 million. Radio Genoa could not be reached for comment.",
      "Eva Vlaardingerbroek -- a conservative Dutch political commentator dubbed the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d whose account Musk has engaged with three dozen times -- uses X to solicit tips and has creator status, which allows her to charge subscription fees. So does Seibt, the German activist -- though she told AP her earnings from X aren\u2019t enough to sustain herself. Vlaardingerbroek did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk has also advocated for Matteo Salvini, vice premier of Italy and the leader of the hard-right, anti-migrant League party. On X, Musk\u2019s interactions boosted Salvini\u2019s daily visibility more than fourfold. Offline, Salvini has urged Italy to move ahead with controversial contracts for Starlink and pushed back against EU efforts to regulate content on X.",
      "Before Fidias Panayiotou \u2014 a 25-year-old social media influencer from Cyprus with no political experience \u2014 won a surprise seat as an independent in the European Parliament last year, he spent weeks camped outside Twitter and Space X headquarters in a highly publicized quest to hug the world\u2019s richest man. In January 2023, his wish came true. Their embrace went viral.",
      "Soon, Musk was interacting with Panayiotou\u2019s posts on a variety of subjects, expanding his typical audience on X by more than 3,000%.",
      "Since taking his seat, Panayiotou -- whose positions often also reflect the views of Cyprus\u2019 traditional leftist establishment -- has praised X on the floor of the European Parliament, pushed back against regulations that impact the platform, and credited Musk with sparking his call to fire 80% of EU bureaucrats.",
      "Musk, evidently, was pleased. \u201cVote for Fidias,\u201d he posted on X, an endorsement that was viewed more than 11.5 million times. \u201cHe is smart, super high energy and genuinely cares about you!\u201d",
      "In July, after AP asked for comment, Panayiotou posted a video to dispel any impression that he was Musk\u2019s puppet. \u201cI don\u2019t have any relationship with Elon Musk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken at all since we hugged, neither through messages, nor by phone, and I\u2019ve never invited him anywhere.\u201d",
      "He said that Musk, unprompted, began reposting his content after he was elected to the European Parliament.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a danger to democracy honestly that Elon Musk supports me,\u201d Panayiotou explained in another video. \u201cI think this is the beauty of democracy.\u201d",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington, D.C., but as he seeks to build a new political party, his power on X \u2014 where he commands the most popular account \u2014 remains unchecked.",
      "Musk is a kingmaker on the platform he acquired in 2022 for $44 billion. He has used his influence to cultivate hard-right politicians and insurgent activists across Europe. A retweet or reply from Musk can lead to millions of views and tens of thousands of new followers, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data.",
      "That fact has not been lost on influencers who have tagged Musk persistently, seeking a reply or a retweet. It has also fueled concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation, told AP.",
      "The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts, which were compiled by Bright Data, over a three-year period from a sample of 11 European figures who had significant interactions with Musk and frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers that share his views.",
      "Since acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Elon Musk\u2019s followers have more than doubled, to over 220 million. No other large account has shown such high or consistent growth.",
      "The result: If Musk\u2019s X account is his megaphone, it has gotten a lot bigger since he took over -- a change that has global implications.",
      "The accounts Musk has been promoting are part of a growing global alliance of nationalistic parties and individuals united in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech, which has rattled the foundation of a trans-Atlantic bond that guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Several of the accounts AP analyzed belong to people who have faced allegations of illegal behavior in their own countries. Tommy Robinson, an anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Bjoern Hoecke, a politician from Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech.",
      "Italian vice premier Matteo Salvini was acquitted in December of allegations he illegally detained 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship",
      "Among the others examined by AP: Alice Weidel, who helped lead Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party to its best electoral showing this year; Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d; Naomi Seibt, a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington DC; Rub\u00e9n Pulido and Foro Madrid, both associated with Spain\u2019s populist Vox party; and Fidias Panayioutou, a politician from Cyprus who has also advocated for Musk\u2019s companies.",
      "These accounts collectively gained roughly 5 million followers from the time Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 through January of this year. Most saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers -- as high as 920%, or in one case of a tiny account exploding over that time, topping 6,000%. Even some accounts that grew more steadily on their own saw their follower counts sharply begin rising once Musk started interacting with them. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, the number of views the account got soared \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "More established players in Musk\u2019s orbit -- like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots \u2014 benefit less when Musk interacts with them on X, AP found.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple shook off a thicket of tariffs and a botched entry into artificial intelligence to accelerate its revenue growth during its springtime quarter, but the trendsetting tech company still faces a bumpy road ahead that could lead to higher iPhone prices.",
      "The April-June results released Thursday came against a backdrop of adversity that has been raising worries about the trajectory of a longtime tech kingpin that expects to absorb a setback of nearly $2 billion from the tariffs that President Donald Trump has already imposed and others in the pipeline.",
      "Despite the doubts, Apple remains a moneymaking machine.",
      "The Cupertino, California, company earned $23.4 billion, or $1.57 per share, during its fiscal third quarter, a 9% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 10% from a year ago to $94 billion. The company\u2019s iPhone sales surged 13% from a year ago to $44.6 billion. In another positive development, Apple's business in China showed signs of snapping out of a prolonged malaise with a 4% bump in revenue from the same time last year.",
      "All those numbers were well above the analyst projections that steer investors, helping to boost Apple\u2019s recently slumping stock price by about 3% in extended trading. But the unexpectedly solid performance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s smooth sailing ahead for Apple.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war targeting foreign-made products such as the iPhone and Apple\u2019s stumbling start in the pivotal transition to AI is causing investors to question if the company will remain at the tech forefront as the industry moves into a new era.",
      "Before Thursday\u2019s report came out, Apple\u2019s stock price had plunged by 17% so far this year to wipe out more than $600 billion in shareholder wealth and knock the company off its perch as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Meanwhile, the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia have surged 32% this year and the shares of AI pacesetter Microsoft have gained 27%, propelling the market value to $4 trillion.",
      "Even though Apple remains highly profitable, the tariffs that Trump has already imposed on China and other countries cost the company $800 million during the past quarter, and CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a conference call that the fees would exact an additional toll of $1.1 billion during the July-September period. The company also predicted its revenue for July-September period would increase at a slightly slower pace than the past quarter.",

      "Cook indicated the financial damage from the tariffs could have been much higher, telling analysts most of the components in iPhones and other Apple products are still shielded by temporary exemptions that the Trump administration granted most electronics in mid-April.",
      "Apple softened the blow of Trump\u2019s tariffs on products made outside the U.S. during the past quarter by shifting its production of iPhones from China to India. But the administration intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, a move that could intensify the pressure on Apple to raise the prices on the next generation of iPhones expected to be released in September. Cook wasn't asked about the possibility of an iPhone increase during his Thursday remarks to analysts.",
      "Consumer fears about the tariffs driving up iPhone prices spurred an unusual buying spree of iPhones and Mac computers in the U.S. during early April, according to Cook. Apple estimated that spike accounted for roughly one percentage point of its 10% revenue increase in the past quarter, which translates into about $82 million in sales. Cook also credited an uptick in consumers upgrading to the latest model for helping Apple sell its 3 billionth iPhone since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "Trump has been pressuring Apple to make all its iPhones in the U.S., a move that analysts believe would take years to pull off and ultimately double or triple the roughly $1,000 average price of the device. But Cook told analysts Thursday that the company is pushing to increase its computer chip production in the U.S. as one way of avoiding tariffs. \u201cWe ultimately will do more in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Apple is still trying to fulfill the AI promises it made last year when it unveiled an array of new iPhone features built on the revolutionary technology, raising expectations that the shift would spur millions of people to upgrade their old devices. But Apple still hasn\u2019t delivered on an AI upgrade that was supposed to smarten up its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri, one of the main reasons underlying the lackluster growth of iPhone sales.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google's Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that's designed to give consumers more choices.",
      "The unanimous ruling issued Thursday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivers a double-barreled legal blow for Google, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials that resulted in different pillars of its internet empire being declared as domineering scofflaws monopolies since late 2023.",
      "The unsuccessful appeal represents a major victory for video game maker Epic Games, which launched a legal crusade targeting Google\u2019s Play Store for Android apps and Apple\u2019s iPhone app store nearly five years ago in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions.",
      "The jury's December 2023 rebuke of Google's app store for Android-powered smartphones began a cascade of setbacks that includes monopoly judgements against the company's ubiquitous search engine last year and the technology underlying its digital ad network earlier this year.",
      "Although not as lucrative as Google's search engine or ad system, the Play Store for Android apps has long been a gold mine that generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by taking a 15% to 30% cut from in-app transactions funneled through the company's own payment processing system.",
      "Following a month-long trial, a nine-person jury determined that Google had rigged its system to thwart alternative app stores from offering better deals to consumers and software developers. That verdict resulted in U.S. District Judge James Donato ordering Google to tear down digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition, triggering the company's appeal to overturn the jury's finding and void the judge's mandated shakeup.",
      "But a three-judge panel that heard Google's appeal in February rejected its lawyers' contention that Donato erred by allowing the case to be determined by a jury that deviated from the market definition outlined by another federal judge who mostly sided with Apple in Epic's case against the iPhone maker's app store.",

Google has argued that the required revisions will raise privacy and security risks by exposing consumers to scam artists and hackers masquerading as legitimate app stores.",

      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",

Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",

      "The amoeba is fairly common and is most dangerous when the water is warm.",
      "There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement.",
      "Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.",
      "\u201cMy son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,\u201d Carr said.",
      "Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies",
      "The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That\u2019s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.",
      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria \u2014 also referred to as blue-green algae \u2014 are plant-like organisms that live in water.",
      "The algae can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water and can grow underneath it.",
      "The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or \u201cbloom,\" in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.",
      "Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "When big infrastructure projects spring up, one crucial law \u2014 the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 has for decades been a key way the government has required powerful industry interests to consider the environment and the public\u2019s voice",
      "When President Donald Trump rolled out a plan to boost artificial intelligence and data centers, a key goal was wiping away barriers to rapid growth.",
      "And that meant taking aim at the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 a 55-year-old, bedrock law aimed at protecting the environment through a process that requires agencies to consider a project's possible impacts and allows the public to be heard before a project is approved. Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",
      "The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, as it's commonly known, to streamline environmental reviews and permitting for data centers and related infrastructure. Republicans and business interests have long criticized NEPA for what they see as unreasonable slowing of development, and Trump\u2019s plan would give \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d to data centers for \u201cmaximum efficiency\u201d in permitting.",
      "A spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said the administration is \u201cfocused on driving meaningful NEPA reform to reduce the delays in federal permitting, unleashing the ability for America to strengthen its AI and manufacturing leadership.\"",
      "Trump's administration has been weakening the law for months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,\u201d said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.",
      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "\"It's been a rough eight months for NEPA,\u201d said Dinah Bear, a former general counsel at the Council on Environmental Quality under both Democratic and Republican presidents.",
      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien, who later worked at the Grand Canyon Trust, also co-chaired a working group that weighed in on a 2012 Forest Service proposal, finalized in 2016, for aspen restoration on Monroe Mountain in Utah. Hunters, landowners, loggers and ranchers all had different opinions on how the restoration should be handled. She said NEPA\u2019s requirement to get the public involved made for better research and a better plan.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the laws that\u2019s the most often used by the public without the public being aware,\u201d said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice. \u201cNEPA has long been the one opportunity for communities and impacted stakeholders and local governments to weigh in.\u201d",
      "Schima said rolling back the power of NEPA threatens the scientific integrity of examining projects' full impacts.",
      "\u201cDecisions are going to be less informed by scientific studies, and that is one of the major concerns here,'' he said.",
      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",

      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

    "story": [
      "Fishing for krill near Antarctica has surged to a record high, nearing a seasonal catch limit that could close the fishery early",
      "MIAMI -- Trawling near Antarctica for krill \u2014 a crustacean central to the diet of whales and a critical buffer to global warming \u2014 has surged to a record and is fast approaching a never before reached seasonal catch limit that would trigger the unprecedented early closure of the remote fishery, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

Activity in one popular fishing ground, denoted Sub-Area 48.1, appears to have more than doubled so far this season compared to the entire 2023-2024 season, according to the the U.S.-based group, which supports sustainable fishing.",
      "Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure.",
      "His group supports the creation of marine protected areas in Antarctica. But it rejects waiting for a conservation deal to adopt \u201cready-to-go measures\u201d raising the quota, which he said can be much higher.",

      "The experts monitoring sanctions against the two groups said \u201cthe organization\u2019s pivot towards parts of Africa continued\" partly because of Islamic State losses in the Middle East due to counterterrorism pressures. There are also \u201cincreasing concerns about foreign terrorist fighters returning to Central Asia and Afghanistan, aiming to undermine regional security,\u201d they said.",
      "The Islamic State also continues to represent \u201cthe most significant threat\u201d to Europe and the Americas, the experts said, often by individuals radicalized via social media and encrypted messaging platforms by its Afghanistan-based Khorasan group.",

      "They pointed to an American who pledged support to IS and drove into a crowd in New Orleans on Jan. 1, killing 14 people in the deadliest attack by al-Qaida or the Islamic State in the U.S. since 2016. In addition, they said, \u201cAuthorities disrupted attacks, including an ISIL-inspired plot to conduct a mass shooting at a military base in Michigan,\u201d and the IS Khorasan affiliate issued warnings of plots targeting Americans.",
      "In Africa\u2019s Sahel region, the experts said, JNIM expanded its area of operations, operating \u201cwith relative freedom\u201d in northern Mali and most of Burkina Faso. There was also a resurgence of activity by the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, \u201cparticularly along the Niger and Nigeria border, where the group was seeking to entrench itself.\u201d",

That law, enacted just after the Civil War, was intended to avoid the appearance of a monarchy.",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reaction the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism for the American Eagle ad could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The discussion continued after eagle-eyed social media users noticed that Dunkin's promotion for its new summer drink features \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d co-star Gavin Casalengo attributing his suntan to genetics.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",

      "But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\u201d",
      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the ad campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",

      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said.",
      "As for Dunkin\u2019s social media video, Casalengo\u2019s burnished skin comes up in the context of the doughnut chain\u2019s Golden Hour Refresher drink. \u201cThis tan? Genetics. I just got my color analysis back and guess what? Golden summer,\" the actor says, referring to the revived trend of wearing clothing that align with one's natural coloring.",
      "A Dunkin\u2019 spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",
      "The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.",
      "Some marketers say they've observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies.",
      "Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.",
      "\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.",
      "American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",
      "\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \u201cBut this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\u201d",
      "Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.",
      "\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have drawn expressions of relief from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April",
      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",
      "\u201cCanada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",
      "Many of Canada's exports to the U.S. are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and face no tariff. But steel, lumber, aluminum and autos have been subject to still higher tariffs.",
      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",
      "Neither New Zealand nor its neighbor Australia have struck tariff deals with the Trump administration. Australian steel and aluminum exports have faced a steep 50% tariff since June.",
      "Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the 10% overall tariff on Australia\u2019s exports to the United States was a vindication of his government\u2019s \u201ccool and calm negotiations.\u201d But he said even that level was not justified. The U.S. exports twice as much to Australia as it imports from its bilateral free trade partner, and Australia imposes no tariffs on U.S. exports.",
      "Objecting to a 15% tariff rate, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re told the newspaper VG the Scandinavian country should have \u201czero tariffs.\" He said talks were continuing.",
      "Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi was cautious in welcoming Trump's executive order setting Japan\u2019s tariff at 15% after the two sides worked out an agreement, much to Tokyo's relief.",

      "DENVER -- Two Colorado deputies have been disciplined for violating state law by helping federal agents make immigration arrests, and their sheriff says officers from other agencies have done the same.",
      "One of the deputies, Alexander Zwinck, was sued by Colorado's attorney general last week, after his cooperation with federal immigration agents on a drug task force was revealed following the June arrest of a college student from Brazil with an expired visa.",
      "Following an internal investigation, a second Mesa County Sheriff's Office deputy and task force member, Erik Olson, was also found to have shared information. The two deputies used a Signal chat to relay information to federal agents, according to documents released Wednesday by the sheriff's office.",
      "Zwinck was placed on three weeks of unpaid leave, and Olson was given two weeks of unpaid leave, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell said in a statement. Both were removed from the task force.",
      "Two supervisors also were disciplined. One was suspended without pay for two days, and another received a letter of reprimand. A third supervisor received counseling.",
      "The lawsuit and disciplinary actions come as lawmakers in Colorado and other Democratic-led states have crafted legislation intended to push back against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Since Trump took office, pro-immigrant bills have advanced through legislatures in Illinois, Vermont, California, Connecticut and other states. The measures include stronger protections for immigrants in housing, employment and police encounters.",
      "Trump has enlisted hundreds of state and local law enforcement agencies to help identify immigrants in the U.S. illegally and detain them for potential deportation. The Republican also relaxed longtime rules restricting immigration enforcement near schools, churches and hospitals.",
      "Zwinck was sued under a new state law signed by Gov. Jared Polis about two weeks before the arrest of the student from Brazil. It bars local government employees including law enforcement from sharing identifying information about people with federal immigration officials. Previously, only state agencies were barred from doing that. It's one of a series of laws limiting the state's involvement in immigration enforcement passed over the years that has drawn criticism and a lawsuit from the federal government.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice has also sued Illinois and New York, as well as several cities in those states and New Jersey, alleging their policies violate the U.S. Constitution or federal immigration laws.",
      "Zwinck and Olson told officials they thought they were operating according to long-standing procedures.",
      "However, the internal investigation found they had both received and read two emails prior to the passage of the new law about previous limits on cooperation with immigration officials. The most recent was sent on Jan. 30, 2025, after an official for Homeland Security Investigations, part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, had asked state and local law enforcement officers at a law enforcement meeting to contact HSI or ICE if they arrested a person for a violent crime who was believed not to be a citizen, the investigation documents said. The email said not to contact HSI or ICE.",

      "Olson, who said he had been with the sheriff\u2019s office 18 years, testified at his disciplinary hearing that it was \u201cstandard practice\u201d to send information up to federal agents during traffic stops.",

      "CHICAGO -- A Peruvian survivor of clergy sex abuse brought her public campaign for reforms to the American hometown of Pope Leo XIV on Thursday, saying he failed in investigating her case when he was a bishop in her home country and needs to step up now as leader of the world\u2019s Catholics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been quiet since the pope has been elected,\u201d Ana Mar\u00eda Quispe D\u00edaz said in Spanish at a news conference in downtown Chicago. \u201cBut I\u2019m not planning to be quiet forever.\u201d",
      "She appeared with members of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. The advocacy group sent a letter to the pope on Thursday renewing demands for more accountability on clergy sex abuse complaints and released documents related to D\u00edaz's case.",
      "The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly, as D\u00edaz has. She began speaking out on social media in 2023, and has faced threats and harassment in Peru because of it, SNAP officials said.",
      "Ahead of Leo\u2019s May election, SNAP filed a formal complaint against then-Cardinal Robert Prevost with the Vatican secretary of state, alleging he abused ecclesiastical power in his handling of two cases.",
      "D\u00edaz said she is a victim in one of those cases which overlapped with Prevost\u2019s tenure as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru. According to the complaint filed in March by SNAP, Prevost's diocese didn't fully investigate in April 2022 when three women accused priests Eleuterio V\u00e1squez Gonz\u00e1les and Ricardo Yesqu\u00e9n of sexually abusing them as minors.",
      "D\u00edaz said Thursday that she had spoken briefly with Prevost on the phone in 2020, telling him how she was abused by V\u00e1squez Gonz\u00e1les, but wasn't given assurances that much could be done. All three women spoke with Prevost in person in 2022 about both priests, according to D\u00edaz.",
      "\u201cHow much more damage can he do now that he is the pope?\" she asked, speaking through a translator.",
      "But Prevost did everything he was supposed to do, according to the Chiclayo diocese and Vatican, including restricting the priest\u2019s ministry, sending a preliminary investigation to the Vatican\u2019s sex crimes office, offering the victims psychological help and suggesting they go to authorities, who archived the case because it happened too long ago.",
      "Pope Francis had a mixed record on responding to the clergy sexual abuse crisis, bungling a major case in Chile in 2018 before reversing course, ordering an investigation and apologizing to the victims. Ultimately, it became a turning point for how he directed the church to handle cases of priests sexually abusing children for the rest of his papacy.",
      "In these cases, the Vatican investigation found Prevost acted correctly in imposing preliminary restrictions on V\u00e1squez Gonz\u00e1les while Peruvian authorities conducted their own civil investigation. The Vatican office archived the case for lack of evidence, then reopened it in 2023 after it gained traction in the media.",
      "Victims\u2019 groups are demanding an accounting from Leo. Meanwhile, his supporters say the Chiclayo case is being exploited by his opponents to undermine him after he made enemies by helping shut down Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, a scandal-plagued lay Catholic community in Peru.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple shook off a thicket of tariffs and a botched entry into artificial intelligence to accelerate its revenue growth during its springtime quarter, but the trendsetting tech company still faces a bumpy road ahead that could lead to higher iPhone prices.",
      "The April-June results released Thursday came against a backdrop of adversity that has been raising worries about the trajectory of a longtime tech kingpin that expects to absorb a setback of nearly $2 billion from the tariffs that President Donald Trump has already imposed and others in the pipeline.",
      "Despite the doubts, Apple remains a moneymaking machine.",
      "The Cupertino, California, company earned $23.4 billion, or $1.57 per share, during its fiscal third quarter, a 9% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 10% from a year ago to $94 billion. The company\u2019s iPhone sales surged 13% from a year ago to $44.6 billion. In another positive development, Apple's business in China showed signs of snapping out of a prolonged malaise with a 4% bump in revenue from the same time last year.",
      "All those numbers were well above the analyst projections that steer investors, helping to boost Apple\u2019s recently slumping stock price by about 3% in extended trading. But the unexpectedly solid performance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s smooth sailing ahead for Apple.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war targeting foreign-made products such as the iPhone and Apple\u2019s stumbling start in the pivotal transition to AI is causing investors to question if the company will remain at the tech forefront as the industry moves into a new era.",
      "Before Thursday\u2019s report came out, Apple\u2019s stock price had plunged by 17% so far this year to wipe out more than $600 billion in shareholder wealth and knock the company off its perch as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Meanwhile, the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia have surged 32% this year and the shares of AI pacesetter Microsoft have gained 27%, propelling the market value to $4 trillion.",
      "Even though Apple remains highly profitable, the tariffs that Trump has already imposed on China and other countries cost the company $800 million during the past quarter, and CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a conference call that the fees would exact an additional toll of $1.1 billion during the July-September period. The company also predicted its revenue for July-September period would increase at a slightly slower pace than the past quarter.",

      "Apple softened the blow of Trump\u2019s tariffs on products made outside the U.S. during the past quarter by shifting its production of iPhones from China to India. But the administration intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, a move that could intensify the pressure on Apple to raise the prices on the next generation of iPhones expected to be released in September. Cook wasn't asked about the possibility of an iPhone increase during his Thursday remarks to analysts.",
      "Consumer fears about the tariffs driving up iPhone prices spurred an unusual buying spree of iPhones and Mac computers in the U.S. during early April, according to Cook. Apple estimated that spike accounted for roughly one percentage point of its 10% revenue increase in the past quarter, which translates into about $82 million in sales. Cook also credited an uptick in consumers upgrading to the latest model for helping Apple sell its 3 billionth iPhone since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "Trump has been pressuring Apple to make all its iPhones in the U.S., a move that analysts believe would take years to pull off and ultimately double or triple the roughly $1,000 average price of the device. But Cook told analysts Thursday that the company is pushing to increase its computer chip production in the U.S. as one way of avoiding tariffs. \u201cWe ultimately will do more in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Apple is still trying to fulfill the AI promises it made last year when it unveiled an array of new iPhone features built on the revolutionary technology, raising expectations that the shift would spur millions of people to upgrade their old devices. But Apple still hasn\u2019t delivered on an AI upgrade that was supposed to smarten up its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri, one of the main reasons underlying the lackluster growth of iPhone sales.",
      "\u201cWhile these numbers certainly buy Apple time, the fact is that investors \u2014 and consumers \u2014 remain laser-focused on AI innovation. And Apple still has a long way to go in this game,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.",

Roy Cooper jumped into the race for that state's newly open seat with a vow to address voters' persistent concerns about the challenges of making ends meet.",
      "Even Republicans quietly note that Cooper\u2019s candidacy makes their job of holding the seat more difficult and expensive. Cooper had raised $2.6 million for his campaign between his Monday launch and Tuesday, and more than $900,000 toward allied groups.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, are hardly ceding the economic populist ground. In announcing his candidacy for the Senate on Thursday, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley credited President Donald Trump with fulfilling campaign promises to working Americans and painted Cooper as a puppet of the left.",
      "Still, Cooper\u2019s opening message that he hears the worries of working families has given Democrats in North Carolina and beyond a sense that they can reclaim their place as the party that champions the middle class. They think it's a message that could help them pick up a Senate seat, and possibly more, in next year's midterm elections, which in recent years have typically favored the party out of power.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Roy Cooper. And I know that today, for too many Americans, the middle class feels like a distant dream,\u201d the former governor said in a video announcing his candidacy. \u201cMeanwhile, the biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense. It\u2019s time for that to change.\u201d",
      "Cooper's plainspoken appeal may represent just the latest effort by Democrats to find their way back to power, but it has some thinking they've finally found their footing after last year's resounding losses.",
      "\u201cI think it would do us all a lot of good to take a close look at his example,\u201d said Larry Grisolano, a Chicago-based Democratic media strategist and former adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Whatley, a former North Carolina GOP chairman and close Trump ally, used his Thursday announcement that he was entering the race to hail the president as the true champion of the middle class. He said Trump had already fulfilled promises to end taxes on tips and overtime and said Cooper was out of step with North Carolinians.",
      "\u201cSix months in, it's pretty clear to see, America is back,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cA healthy, robust economy, safe kids and communities and a strong America. These are the North Carolina values that I will champion if elected.\u201d",
      "Still, the decision by Cooper, who held statewide office for 24 years and has never lost an election, makes North Carolina a potential bright spot in a midterm election cycle when Democrats must net four seats to retake the majority \u2014 and when most of the 2026 Senate contests are in states Trump won comfortably last November.",
      "State Rep. Cynthia Ball threw up a hand in excitement when asked Monday at the North Carolina Legislative Building about Cooper\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cEveryone I\u2019ve spoken to was really hoping that he was going to run,\u201d said the Raleigh Democrat.",
      "Democratic legislators hope having Cooper\u2019s name at the top of the ballot will encourage higher turnout and help them in downballot races. While Republicans have controlled both General Assembly chambers since 2011, Democrats managed last fall to end the GOP\u2019s veto-proof majority, if only by a single seat.",
      "Republican strategists familiar with the national Senate landscape have said privately that Cooper poses a formidable threat.",
      "The Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC affiliated with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, wasted no time in challenging Cooper's portrayal of a common-sense advocate for working people.",
      "\u201cRoy Cooper masquerades as a moderate,\u201d the narrator in the 30-second spot says. \u201cBut he's just another radical, D.C. liberal in disguise.\u201d",

      "Cooper, a former state legislator who served four terms as attorney general before he became governor, has never held an office in Washington. Still, Whatley was quick to link Cooper to national progressive figures such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.",
      "Whatley accused Cooper of failing to address illegal immigration and of supporting liberal gender ideology. He echoed the themes raised in the Senate Leadership Fund ad, which noted Cooper's vetoes in the Republican-led legislature of measures popular with conservatives, such as banning gender-affirming health care for minors and requiring county sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration officials.",
      "\u201cRoy Cooper may pretend to be different than the radical extremists,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cBut he is all-in on their agenda.\u201d",
      "Cooper first won the governorship in 2016, while Trump was carrying the state in his first White House bid. Four years later, they both carried the state again.",
      "Cooper, who grew up in a small town 60 miles (96.6 kilometers) east of Raleigh, has long declined requests that he seek federal office. He \u201cunderstands rural North Carolina,\u201d veteran North Carolina strategist Thomas Mills said. \u201cAnd while he\u2019s not going to win it, he knows how to talk to those folks.\u201d",
      "As with most Democrats, Cooper's winning coalition includes the state's largest cities and suburbs. But he has long made enough inroads in other areas to win.",

      "In his video announcement, Cooper tried to turn the populist appeal Trump made to voters on checkbook issues against the party in power, casting himself as the Washington outsider.

      "\u201cPart of the challenge Democrats had in 2024 is we were not addressing directly the issues people were concerned about today,\u201d",

      "Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century, a group that conducts research for an initiative called the Working Class Project, said Cooper struck a tone that other Democrats should try to match.",
      "\u201cHis focus on affordability and his outsider status really hits a lot of the notes these folks are interested in,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cI do think it's a model, especially his focus on affordability.\u201d",

      "Pendergrass was known for his timeless music as lead singer of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes and a solo career that included many hits such as \"Turn Off the Lights\" and \"Love T.K.O.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated star of \"The English Patient\" and \"Slow Horses\" has directed and co-written her first film: the heartfelt \"My Mother's Wedding,\" about three daughters who come together to attend their mom's third nuptials \u2013 a story inspired by Thomas' own childhood losses.",
    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all! Keep it coming!'\"",

    "summary": "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached.",
    "story": [
      "A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers, made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \"baby parade.\"",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \"baby bonuses,\" a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that it doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",

      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, up from 4.1% in June.",
      "The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring earlier this year was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the figures show that the private sector added only 3,000 jobs in June.",
      "Factoring in the downward revisions, the three-month average employment gain from May to June was 35,000, compared to an average of 123,000 from January to April.",
      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains \u00a0in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cut in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners is weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting today, Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",
      "How much will my payment increase?",
      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",
      "Borrowers should evaluate the four repayment plans available, which can be found at here at the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said.",
      "Changing plans will depend on your situation, added Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit that provides free advice for student borrowers.",
      "Borrowers who are seeking loan forgiveness, which can be earned after repaying a loan for anywhere from 10 years to 25 years, depending on the plan, may want switch because \"the SAVE forbearance doesn't count towards the payments needed to get the balance forgiven under those plans,\" she said.",
      "What about the new Repayment Assistance Plan?",
      "There's also a new repayment plan in the works that borrowers could consider, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which is due in 2026 and is part of the \"big beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4.",
      "\"For earners who make less than $10,000, their [monthly] payment will be $10 under RAP,\" Hubert said.",
      "For those with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $10,000 per year, the repayments will be based on 1% to 10% of their income minus $50 in payments each month for each child the borrower has. \"With that in mind, we can estimate that a borrower who has an AGI of $45,000 and no children would have their monthly payment set at $150,\" she added.",
      "RAP payments could carry a higher monthly payment for some borrowers than under the SAVE plan, but the SAVE plan is likely to eventually be eliminated due to the court cases, Mayotte said.",
      "\"At a minimum, I would suggest trying to make payments that cover the monthly interest as it begins to accrue to prevent your balance from growing,\" Hubert added.",

      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",

      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday sharply probed\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as higher duties are set to snap into place Friday for countries that have not yet reached trade deals with the administration.",
      "The 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "As arguments got underway, several judges on the appeals court peppered Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, about whether IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs.",
      "One judge immediately noted that the law has never before been used to assess the levies on trading partners.",
      "Many other laws regulating trade include the word \"tariff,\" the judge said, \"but here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them.\"",
      "Pointing to those trade statutes, which impose constraints on the duties that a president can assess, one of the judges questioned why a president would rely on those laws when IEEPA provides broader power under the Justice Department's interpretation.",
      "\"Your argument dislocates that entire U.S. trade-relief framework,\" he said.",
      "Later, looking at the harmonized tariff schedule, which sets tariff rates and categories for merchandise imported into the U.S., members of the court criticized the scope of Mr. Trump's levies, which cover nearly every country.",
      "\"It's a wholesale revision of the scheme that Congress enacted,\" a judge said, adding, \"it's really kind of asking for an extraordinary change\" to the legislature's approach to the tariff schedule.",
      "Other members of the Federal Circuit seemed concerned with the breadth of authority the president was claiming in relying on IEEPA to impose broad tariffs on trading partners.",
      "\"It seems to me you're asking for unbounded authority,\" one judge told Shumate.",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday for countries the administration has not reached trade agreements with.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy. Shumate argued before the Federal Circuit that courts should not second-guess the president's determination that trade deficits are an emergency, and some of the judges seemed inclined to agree that the consequences of those imbalances would fit within IEEPA's framework.",
      "He also said that the emergency powers law authorizes a president to \"regulate ... any ... importation,\" and that covers the imposition of tariffs.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"That is a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,\" Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small businesses, told the Federal Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",

      "Your glass of French or Italian wine could get pricier as soon as next week, with a new 15% U.S. tariff on European Union imports set to kick in on Aug. 1. The same goes for popular brands of whisky, cognac and other spirits, many of which are made in Europe.",
      "Harry Root, owner of Grassroots Wine, in Charleston, South Carolina, which distributes domestic and imported wines to restaurants and retailers, said the new levies on goods from the 27-country EU will leave him no choice but to raise prices for his clients, which he said are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers.",
      "\"We have to increase prices because when the container of wine I've ordered lands, I have to pay 100% of whatever the tariff is on that wine,\" Root said on Wednesday at a U.S. Wine Trade Alliance (USWTA) roundtable on the impact of the new U.S. tariffs on the EU.",
      "Higher prices for imported wines will also raise the cost of wine produced in the U.S. as consumers shift to domestic labels and drive up demand, according to USWTA President Ben Aneff.",
      "\"Econ 101 will tell you that higher-cost imported products will also mean higher prices for domestic products,\" Aneff said at the roundtable. \"So you'd expect a big drop in demand, higher prices, lower choice for consumers. It's a problem.\"",
      "Max Rohn, CEO of Long Island, New York-based Wolffer Estate winery, put it bluntly.",
      "\"We want people to drink wine, and tariffs will make them drink less wine,\" he said during the USWTA event.",
      "A trade group representing Italian winemakers, Unioni Vini Italiani, is warning that a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. could cost around $15 after the 15% EU tariff kicks in.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment about concerns that higher tariffs on EU and other imports could raise the cost of wine and spirits in the U.S.",
      "Higher costs for a wee dram",
      "A 10% American\u00a0levy on the U.K. under a trade deal announced in May could also push up liquor costs for U.S. consumers. Drew McKenzie Smith, founder and managing director of Fife, Scotland-based Lindores Abbey Distillery, told CBS MoneyWatch that the tariff on shipments to the U.S. could force him to hike the price of a bottle of scotch by an equivalent amount.",
      "\"We had hoped to shoulder that cost because if you put your whisky up too much, then people won't buy it. But to cover that, it means we'd have to add 10% to the price of a bottle, so it's a tricky one,\" he said, noting that a bottle of Abbey Distillery scotch that currently retails for about $86 could rise to about $94.",
      "In 2024, the U.K. exported 132 million bottles of scotch whisky to the U.S., according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research firm that is tracking the effects of tariffs on food and beverage costs in the U.S, said that the wine and spirits business is more exposed to tariffs because consumers are less likely to switch to domestic substitutes.",
      "\"It's a little different when you're assessing the impact on prices related to wine and spirits compared to other goods because consumers have certain tastes and preferences,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Meanwhile, unlike with some industries, which may be able to relocate factories from abroad to the U.S., wine production can't be reshored.",
      "\"You can't produce French wine in the U.S. because then it ceases to be French wine,\" he said. \"If consumers have a strong preference for a particular bottle, they'll continue to buy it.\"",
      "Added Aneff of the USWTA, \"Wines from one place are not fungible for wines from another. It's a different product.\"",
      "Lobbying for relief",
      "Trade groups for both European and domestic wine producers are lobbying for exemptions from the 15% tariffs on most EU goods, citing the potential for substantial losses on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Unione Italiana Vini said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that the 15% tariff would result in a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the finalized deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "The USWTA is also urging U.S. trade officials to include wine in its list of exempted goods under the new U.S.-EU trade deal.",
      "\"We are heartened that negotiations are leaving room for wine to be included under the zero-for-zero exemption structure,\" Aneff said in a statement. \"Now is the time to ensure wine is prioritized in the final agreement.\"",
      "Addressing the EU tariff agreement, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO Chris Swonger\u00a0said\u00a0the group is also \"optimistic that in the days ahead this positive meeting and agreement will lead to a return to zero-for-zero tariffs for U.S. and EU spirits products.\"",
      "Peril for restaurants",
      "The stepped up U.S. tariffs on the EU wouldn't just hurt consumers \u2014 they could also lead to the loss of thousands of jobs at manufacturers and distributors, according to industry experts. Restaurants, which depend on sales of European wines to buoy them financially, also could feel the impact in the form of slimmer profits.",
      "Typically, if a restaurant pays $15 for a bottle of wine from France or Italy, the two largest exporters to the U.S., it will charge patrons $15 a glass, Aneff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Their margin is five times the cost of the bottle,\" he said. \"And for a restaurant that's not a luxury \u2014 it's an absolute necessity.\"",

      "EU imports \"are vital for the 47,500 wine retailers, 6,000 importers and distributors, and hundreds of thousands of restaurants around the country,\" Aneff said. \"In a nutshell, wine from the European Union brings an incredible economic surplus to businesses in the U.S. No other product allows us to capture such a huge percentage of the revenue generated here in the U.S.\"",

      "In his Thursday social media post, the president said he agreed to a 90-day extension during a phone conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, which he described as \"very successsful.\"",
      "The president has turned to tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he says are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline to strike new trade deals with Mexico and many other nations, the Trump administration has announced trade deals with\u00a0five Asian countries, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union.",

      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate.

But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid.

      "\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"",
      "He added, \"We will make sure this doesn't move from being a one-time price increase to serious inflation.\"",
      "Powell's remarks emphasizing the solid U.S. economy, as well as the risks from tariffs, signaled to some economists that a September rate cut might not be in the cards.",

    "summary": "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp turnaround from earlier this year when it fell 0.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending what's known as a de minimis exemption allowing low-value parcels that are shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs.",
      "The White House said it's closing what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S. The order goes into effect Aug. 29.",
      "The exemption had applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, and allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "\"President Trump is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "Mr. Trump in May ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong, which had allowed retailers like Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S. according to the White House.",
      "The de minimis provision, which was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after that law's passage, was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",

      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",

The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon.

      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0at the White House in February, he said the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. India's leading supplier.",

    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at today's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "title": "Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",
      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:40:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",

      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",

      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China.

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday said the tariff rate for most countries that don't reach individual trade deals with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15 to 20% range,\" different from the 15% to 50% range he floated only last week.",
      "Asked about a tariff rate \"for the world,\" as Mr. Trump put it, the president responded, \"I would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20% range.\" The U.S. president made the remarks seated alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, as Mr. Trump visits his golf courses there and meets with European leaders.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. have already reached a trade agreement, and over the weekend, after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the two leaders announced a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU.",
      "A Trump administration deadline of Aug. 1 for other countries to reach trade deals with the U.S. is rapidly approaching. Without an individual deal, Mr. Trump says most countries' products will see a flat tariff rate.",
      "\"I just want to be nice. I would say in the range of 15 to 20%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding, \"probably one of those two numbers.\"",
      "But as recently as Wednesday, Mr. Trump floated a higher range, between 15% and 50%. Mr. Trump, who in April said the U.S. had 200 trade deals with other nations, has since said there are too many countries for individual trade deals with all of them and the U.S. will have \"simple\" tariffs for \"most\" countries.",
      "\"We have over 200 countries, people don't realize, that's a lot of, that's a lot of deals ... that would be too much for anybody,\" the president said Wednesday.",
      "Tariffs are paid for by the importing business to the U.S. government, and are not directly paid by a foreign company's government or company. Companies may pass along those higher expenses to U.S. consumers.",

    "summary": "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump said the U.S. would be \"paying for\" IVF.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On the campaign trail, Donald Trump made a pledge: Under his leadership, in vitro fertilization would be covered for all women and couples seeking the treatment. \"We are going to be paying for that treatment,\" he said in an interview in August 2024.",
      "After taking office, President Trump signed an executive order directing his domestic policy council to make recommendations on IVF policy changes by May. But that deadline has come and gone, and the White House has said little about the issue. Advocates for better IVF coverage are wondering what the holdup is.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has called himself the \"father of IVF\" and claimed to be a \"leader on fertilization, IVF,\" told NBC News, during that 2024 interview, that IVF would be covered for everyone who needs it.",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,\" Mr. Trump, then a candidate, said. He added, \"We're going to be paying for that treatment, or we're gonna be mandating that the insurance company pay.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order, signed in February, fell short of his campaign pledge, stating that it would be administration policy \"to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\"",
      "He directed his assistant for the White House Domestic Policy Council to submit within 90 days \"recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.\"",
      "That deadline would have fallen on May 19. Asked for an update, the White House declined to comment.",
      "Cristina Gonzales and her partner, who live in New York City, have been struggling with infertility for about three years. Gonzales, who makes campaign ads for Democrats, is a part of a support group for women over 40 going through IVF. The women represent diverse political and ideological backgrounds, including liberals and those who support Mr. Trump, alike. When then-candidate Trump said IVF would be covered, Gonzales said some in her group \"believed completely and wholeheartedly\" that he would make coverage free.",
      "\"They deserve that promise to be kept,\" Gonzales said.",
      "\"This struggle of IVF is nonpartisan,\" she said. \"It affects everybody.\"",
      "In February, a Washington Post interview with Trump supporter and fired federal worker Ryleigh Cooper went viral. She said she didn't want to vote for Mr. Trump, but he'd promised to make IVF free. After reading the fact sheet from Mr. Trump's February executive order, she told the Post she said, \"'That's bullsh**.'\"",
      "IVF is a fertility treatment that has broad support; in 2023, over 95,000 babies were born as a result of IVF \u2014 about 2.6% of all births in the U.S. \u2014 according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",
      "An overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 86% \u2014 think IVF should be legal, according to a March 2024 CBS News/YouGov poll.",
      "\"Eighty-six percent of Americans support IVF. That is unheard of in almost any issue you could think of in modern times,\" said Danielle Melfi, CEO of infertility advocacy nonprofit RESOLVE.",
      "According to an April 2024 Pew survey, 79% of Democrats and those who lean Democratic say access to IVF is a good thing, as do 63% of Republicans and those who lean Republican. Even among Americans who told Pew abortion should be illegal in most cases, 60% view IVF access positively.",
      "And Mr. Trump has introduced other concepts, including a \"baby bonus\" for babies born in the U.S., to help boost the U.S. birth rate. The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024, with fewer than 1.6 children being born per woman, according to new federal data. The bonus is available to parents who open so-called Trump Accounts, which were introduced in the president's massive domestic policy bill that he signed into law last month.",
      "Melfi is optimistic about the momentum the issue has picked up and has made recommendations to the White House, among them, to increase health insurance coverage of all fertility-related treatment, include fertility coverage for veterans and military families, and cover fertility care for all federal employees.",
      "Out-of-pocket costs are the biggest barrier to undergoing IVF, Melfi said. Each cycle \u2014 and many couples undergo several cycles \u2014 costs between $12,000 and $25,000. Very few states require insurance companies to provide coverage for the treatment, so the vast majority of women and couples must pay out of pocket for IVF rounds.",
      "\"Each state looks a little bit different, which is why action at the federal level would be really meaningful,\" Melfi said of state laws governing insurance coverage of IVF.",
      "IVF is one of multiple infertility treatments available, and is often the last \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 step women take to become pregnant.",
      "In the process, a woman typically administers expensive shots to herself every day to stimulate the growth of multiple eggs at once and regularly goes to a fertility clinic for ultrasounds and blood work to monitor progress. The eggs are retrieved, fertilized outside of the body and ideally, they develop into healthy embryos that can be implanted immediately or frozen for later use.",
      "Many find it to be an exhausting process \u2014 physically, emotionally and financially.",
      "Leading up to her first round of IVF, Gonzales was anxious. What if she and her partner were to spend all this money only for the procedure to not result in pregnancy?",
      "\"I don't have enough money for this and I feel like there's a lot of pressure on my body \u2014 what if it doesn't perform?\" she said.",
      "For her, an unexpected year-end bonus had provided a way to pay. But otherwise, it might not have been possible.",
      "\"When you look at health insurance policies, almost none of them cover fertility,\" Gonzales said. \"Even so-called progressive states.\"",
      "Still, IVF provides no guarantees. Gonzales has undergone four rounds of IVF, none of which resulted in a baby, and now, she and her partner are pursuing other paths to parenthood. IVF has ultimately been successful for other women in her IVF support group, and she thinks every person should have the chance to pursue the procedure, regardless of their financial circumstances.",
      "\"I don't regret it, I would definitely do it all over again,\" she said.",
      "Gonzales hopes the president follows through on his pledge to make sure IVF is covered for those who want and need it.",
      "\"It would be one of the smartest policies for them to actually make good on this promise,\" she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately.",
      "Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "story": [
      "Carolyn Feinstein said she initially thought the message sent to her private email address on a late Friday afternoon was a scheme or a prank. It turned out that she was being fired from her federal job. Once Feinstein read the email, she discovered her work cellphone was no longer operating.",
      "Feinstein's decade of work as a forensic auditor for the Justice Department's Office of Trustee \u2014 which helps oversee bankruptcies \u2014 ended on July 18, when her employment was terminated in a three-paragraph message sent by an agency administrator.",
      "\"This is a big loss to me,\" Feinstein told CBS News. \"I have dedicated my career to the mission of the U.S. Trustee program. I believe strongly in that mission. I would get up every day knowing that my actions professionally were helping. They were adding to the greater good.\"",
      "Feinstein joins dozens of other Justice Department employees who have been ousted this year. Her firing was conducted in a similar fashion to other Justice Department terminations, via an email from the agency that cited the administration's \"Article II\" power to fire employees.",
      "\"I felt like I was just kind of left in the dark, because that termination letter really didn't explain anything to me,\" Feinstein said.",
      "But Feinstein's background and her case are different from the others.",
      "Feinstein's husband, who operates a private business, developed a controversial phone app that helped users track the location of federal immigration agents. The ICEBlock app, which carries the moniker, \"see something; tap something\", bills itself as an \"innovative, completely anonymous crowdsourced platform that allows users to report Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity with just two taps on their phone.\"",
      "ICEBlock \u2014 and similar apps that notify people about the presence of ICE agents \u2014 have grown in popularity this year, as the Trump administration aims to ramp up arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. Administration officials have lashed out at those responsible for these apps, alleging they impede the work of federal law enforcement.",
      "In the days after the ICEBlock app was publicized in reporting by CNN and later by Trump ally and social media figure Laura Loomer, Feinstein said she notified her employers about threats she and her husband had been receiving from critics.",
      "Feinstein said she was fired days after, with the Justice Department alleging the termination was \"based on your lack of candor during an internal inquiry.\"",
      "\"It's dehumanizing to the federal workforce, it's treating them like commodities,\" said Kel McClanahan, an attorney who is representing Feinstein.",
      "McClanahan told CBS News he views the recent wave of firings as a governmental version of a \"5-year-old's tantrums.\"",
      "Feinstein has a 20% ownership of the company that operates ICEBlock, which her husband runs, according to McClanahan. The lawyer told CBS News that Feinstein held an ownership stake to allow her to wind down the company if her husband were to face an emergency or die. The app is free, and Feinstein's husband told CNN he doesn't plan to monetize it.",
      "McClanahan said Feinstein had reported her connection to the business behind the app on annual disclosure forms.",
      "The Justice Department cited the app and Feinstein's connection to the company in a statement defending her firing.",
      "\"For several weeks, the Department of Justice inquired into this former employee's activities and discovered she has a sizable interest in All U Chart, Inc., the company that holds the IP for ICEBlock,\" a Justice Department spokeswoman told CBS News. \"ICEBlock is an app that illegal aliens use to evade capture while endangering the lives of ICE officers by disclosing their location. This DOJ will not tolerate threats against law enforcement or law enforcement officers.\"",
      "Feinstein is the latest of dozens of career Justice Department civil servants fired this year. In the hours after President Trump's second inauguration, his administration began conducting a purge of prosecutors, staff and office administrators who were involved in prosecuting people who took part in the Jan. 6 riot \u2014 a violent insurrection that Mr. Trump has sought to redefine \u2014 and the criminal investigations of Trump himself, which were shuttered in 2024 after his election.",
      "The firings have continued this summer, with several high-profile terminations of administrators and prosecutors, who have claimed their firings were forms of political retribution.",
      "Feinstein argued her firing will exacerbate a staffing shortage inside the agency's bankruptcy\u00a0 trustee audit program. She worked out of a Texas office for the U.S. Trustee Program.",
      "\"Those people are very competent and able to do their jobs, but they are only human. So when you take out someone as proficient as myself in such a vital role as auditor, it is really going to impact what that office can do for the program,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department is facing unusually severe shortages of employees in other major offices, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "In late spring, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia had 89 staffing openings, a capacity gap that two former prosecutors said could lead to staff being overworked and greater delays in processing cases. That office handled all of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, and saw multiple prosecutors fired early in 2025. The office's total workforce is nearly 700 people, including prosecutors and support staff.",
      "Federal employees, including Feinstein, have the right to challenge their terminations under the government's Merit Services Protection Board. But several fired employees have told CBS News the board is jammed with a wave of new cases and is less able to move swiftly on any new complaint.",
      "Feinstein said she loved job and misses the work.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending the legal status and deportation protections for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "While it could be suspended by a higher court, the ruling is a reprieve for more than 60,000 immigrants who had been previously allowed by the U.S. government to live and work in the country legally for years and in some cases, since the late 1990s, under the Temporary Protected Status program.",
      "Immigrants from Nepal enrolled in the TPS program were set to lose their legal status next week, on Aug. 5. TPS holders from Honduras and Nicaragua, meanwhile, were slated to see their work permits and deportation protections under the program expire in early September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ordered the planned TPS terminations for these countries to be postponed through at least Nov. 18, when she scheduled a hearing on the merits of a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision. Thompson said the delay could be extended beyond Nov. 18.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the Department of Homeland Security to offer a temporary safe haven \u2014 in the form of deportation deferrals and work authorization \u2014 to immigrants from countries beset by armed conflict, an environmental disaster or other crises.",
      "Those enrolled in TPS are generally immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally or who arrived legally on temporary visas and then applied for the humanitarian program.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, arguing that some of them are contrary to U.S. national interests and that they've been in place for too long, despite their temporary nature and improved conditions in the relevant countries.",
      "The administration, for example, has noted that the TPS programs for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in 1999, after Hurricane Mitch caused catastrophic floods and killed thousands in Central America. The TPS program for Nepal was announced in 2015, after an earthquake hit the small Asian country. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said all three countries have recovered from those environmental disasters.",
      "But Thompson, the San Francisco-based federal judge, said the TPS holders who sued the Trump administration were likely to succeed in their arguments that Noem's decisions were \"preordained\" actions that did not fully consider lingering conditions in Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "Thompson, who was appointed by former President Biden, also found the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in arguing that Noem's decisions were \"motivated by racial animus.\" Thompson cited statements by Noem that she said stereotyped the TPS program and associated immigrants with criminality.",
      "The judge also referenced a comment made by President Trump during the 2024 campaign in which he said migrants entering the U.S. illegally were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"",
      "\"The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",

    "summary": "Justice Brett Kavanaugh spoke about the Supreme Court's emergency orders before a group of lawyers and judges in Kansas City, Missouri.",
    "story": [
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended how the Supreme Court is handling an unprecedented number of emergency appeals from the Trump administration, saying that as presidents push the limits of their power, courts will have to respond.",
      "Speaking before a group of lawyers and judges Thursday in Kansas City, Missouri, Kavanaugh said presidents in both parties, stymied by inaction in Congress, have relied more on executive orders \"to get things done.\" That's led to more legal challenges, Kavanaugh said, which inevitably draw in the Supreme Court to determine whether the new regulation can take effect, at least temporarily, while the legal challenges play out.",
      "So far, the court has been inclined to say yes, agreeing to allow a number of President Trump's high-profile executive orders to take effect while the lower courts review the merits, such as orders to fire members of independent federal agencies, freeze certain federal grants and plan layoffs at nearly every federal agency.",
      "Asked about criticism that the court isn't doing enough to explain its reasoning in some of those emergency cases, Kavanaugh said the court has written more than it has in the past. He said the court also had made some internal changes in the past five or six years \"to try to get the right answer,\" including scheduling emergency oral arguments, as in the recent case challenging nationwide injunctions.",
      "He said he was a \"fan of more process\" and mentioned two recent cases, including the president's removal power in independent agencies, where he unsuccessfully urged the court to step in and decide the underlying issue before it went through the lower courts.",
      "Kavanaugh's hour-long remarks came in a conversation with U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk, one of his former law clerks, at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit's judicial conference. It's one of several judicial conferences this summer that will feature different justices.",
      "Last week, Justice Elena Kagan spoke to the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where she urged the court to be more cautious with its handling of the so-called emergency docket. She also said that while she finds some of the court's recent decisions \"frustrating\" and \"sometimes even maddening,\" prompting fierce dissents, she believed her colleagues were \"all operating in good faith.\"",
      "Kavanaugh shared a similar sentiment about the other justices, saying even in disagreement, \"they're thoughtfully engaging in difficult issues,\" and he believed it was \"a sign of strength when there are different views expressed.\"",
      "\"The collegiality of the Supreme Court is very strong, strong to this day,\" he said. \"We all look out for each other. We think the other eight are patriots and are good people.\"",
      "His wide-ranging conversation with Pitlyk was at times personal and humorous, touching on everything from lessons he's taken from sports to some of his favorite opinions in recent terms. He said he's aware of criticism of the court, but that \"criticism is part of the job.\"",
      "Like the referees for high school sports, Kavanaugh said, as a justice, \"you have to recognize and know thick skin and criticism comes with the territory.\"",
      "\"Did you ever walk out of a game and say, 'our team lost, but the refs were great?'\" Kavanaugh said, to laughter from the audience. \"That informs my judging, too.\"",
      "Jan Crawford is CBS News' chief legal correspondent and a recognized authority on the Supreme Court. Her 2007 book, \"Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for the Control of the United States Supreme Court\" (Penguin Press), gained critical acclaim and became an instant New York Times Bestseller."

    "story": [
      "Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the Biden administration, said her appointment to a position at West Point was \"unfortunately\" rescinded.",
      "Easterly referred CBS News to a LinkedIn post she wrote on Thursday: \"Unfortunately, the opportunity to serve again at my alma mater was rescinded \u2014a casualty of casually manufactured outrage that drowned out the quiet labor of truth and the steady pulse of integrity.\"",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll on Wednesday rescinded an agreement for Easterly to be a chair in West Point's social sciences department after pro-Trump activist Laura Loomer posted on social media about the hire.",
      "Easterly was named the Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair in the Department of Social Sciences in an X post, now deleted, by the dean of West Point, who referred to her appointment as a \"homecoming worth celebrating.\"",
      "Loomer pointed to the post, saying Biden administration holdovers were \"undermining the Trump administration.\"",
      "The next day, Driscoll shared on X his memo directing West Point to rescind its agreement with Easterly, pause outside groups from hiring faculty and request the United States Military Academy Board of Visitors conduct a top-down vetting process of its hiring.",
      "Earlier this year, the head of U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, Gen. Timothy Haugh was also dismissed after Loomer publicly called for his termination.",
      "A spokesperson for West Point referred questions to the Secretary of the Army, and an Army spokesperson said in a statement, \"ahead of the upcoming academic year, we are crafting a deliberate approach to ensure that our future officers are best prepared to meet the demands of the modern battlefield,\" without answering why Easterly's appointment was revoked.",
      "Easterly was accused of \"censorship\" by Loomer for her work as CISA director during the Biden administration to counter disinformation after the 2020 election.",
      "\"We're not turning cadets into censorship activists. We're turning them into warriors and leaders,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said.",

      "She had deployments to Haiti, Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "Easterly said in her post, \"To those cadets I had looked forward to teaching: know that your purpose is not defined by titles or accolades. It is defined by character. The world needs your strength, your courage, your warrior spirit, your will to win. But it also needs your empathy, your intellect, your humility, your integrity.\"",
      "Both the Biden administration and Trump administration made changes to the board of visitors for the United States Military Academy upon entering office. The Board of Visitors is a federal advisory committee that \"inquires into the state of morale and discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters relating to the Academy that the Board decides to consider,\" according to its website.",

    "summary": "Statistics indicate Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during President Trump's first 5 months in office. About 11% of arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California.",
    "story": [
      "Most of the more than 109,000 arrests carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first five months of President Trump's second term took place in border and Southern states, according to a CBS News analysis of government data.",
      "States in the southern U.S., as well as those along the border with Mexico, saw the highest levels of ICE arrests between the start of Mr. Trump's second term on Jan. 20 and June 27, the figures show.",
      "That continued a trend that predates the current administration, though ICE arrests have increased sharply across the country since last year. During the same time period in 2024, under the Biden administration, ICE made over 49,000 arrests, meaning that arrests by the agency have increased by 120% under the Trump administration.",
      "The statistics indicate that Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during that time period. About 11% of ICE arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California, followed by 4% in Georgia and 3% in Arizona. ICE made the fewest arrests in Vermont, Alaska and Montana, about 100 total apprehensions combined.",
      "The locations of a small percentage of the arrests could not be discerned from the dataset, which was obtained by a group known as the Deportation Data Project through litigation.",
      "Overall, the individuals arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and June 27 came from nearly 180 countries, but most were from Latin America or the Caribbean, according to the data.",
      "Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador.",
      "Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE.",
      "\"It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,\" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, \"ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,\" she added.",
      "Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. \"Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close\" to the U.S., she said.",
      "Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history.",
      "Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody.",
      "Halfway into Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, ICE recorded 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track to carry out the most removals since the Obama administration, over a decade ago, CBS News reported. The tally is still far short of the 1 million annual deportations Trump officials have said they're targeting.",

    "story": [
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "Over the years, the U.S. has implemented heavy sanctions on Iranian industries, including trying to stop tankers used to transfer Iranian oil to China, which could help fund Iranian nuclear development programs. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions, which Washington called the most extensive action of its kind since 2018.",
      "Recently, a CBS News crew set off from Singapore, one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, to head more than 80 nautical miles away in international waters to see how the \"dark fleet\" operates.",
      "\"As long as there's a supply, there will be a demand for this discounted oil,\" said Charlie Brown, a former U.S. Navy officer who's now a senior adviser with United Against Nuclear Iran, who is advising the U.S. government.",
      "The supply is Iran, the demand is China, and this mutually beneficial relationship, which has long angered the United States, plays out off the coast of Malaysia in the Riau archipelago, an area the size of New York City.",
      "\"This is 'dark fleet' parking central,\" said Brown, who's been monitoring the \"dark fleet\" for years.",
      "He described one ship, the Tifani, as \"a well-known 'dark fleet' tanker that's always been out here on a regular basis.\"",
      "The tankers, full of oil, sail from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Malacca to the Riau archipelago. There, they transfer the crude to ships bound for China, which buys 90% of Iran's oil.",
      "During the CBS News crew's journey, four ship-to-ship transfers were happening in plain sight.",
      "These \"dark fleet\" tankers \u2014 all with their transponders switched off \u2014   clearly do not want to be identified.",
      "\"Both ships have a net or something, a tarp, deployed over the stern, covering the name and identification number \u2014   it's obvious deceptive practice,\" Brown said.",
      "Further analysis revealed one ship was the elusive Stellar Oracle, laden with Iranian oil. It was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in May.",
      "Close by, another ship-to-ship transfer was underway involving the Alps \u2014   not its real name \u2014   filled with Iranian crude that was also sanctioned in May. The receiving vessel Eon, which is not on any list, was caught in the act \u2014   a new sanctions violator.",
      "According to a congressional report last year, this trade generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, propping up the regime and its nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on this trade this year, but it's having little effect. China doesn't recognize the unilateral U.S. sanctions on Iran and says that its trade with Iran is legitimate.",
      "By the end of the day, 12 ship-to-ship transfers were recorded in the Riau archipelago \u2014   an unprecedented number and a clear indication Iran and China are only ramping up this illicit activity.",

    "summary": "he NYPD said the gunman purchased the fully-assembled AR 15-style rifle used in the shooting from his supervisor.",
    "story": [
      "Shane Tamura, the gunman who drove from Las Vegas to Manhattan and opened fire in a New York City office building Monday and killed four people, was issued a concealed carry permit in Nevada, despite a documented history of mental health incidents.",
      "Sources said the gunman had at least two mental health incidents in 2022 and 2024. He was also arrested for trespassing in 2023. Law enforcement sources confirmed that he obtained the concealed carry permit in spring 2022.",
      "Tamura, 27, bought the fully assembled AR 15-style rifle for $1,400 from his supervisor at the Las Vegas casino where he worked.\u00a0 The NYPD said the supervisor's purchase of the rifle was legal, but it hasn't yet determined whether Tamura broke any law in buying it from him. The supervisor, Rick Ackley, complied with state and federal gun laws in the sale to Tamura, his attorney, Chris Rasmussen, said.",
      "The NYPD also said they found a handgun in Tamura's\u00a0car, which was purchased legally with the concealed carry permit in June from a gun store in Las Vegas. A tipster told law enforcement that same month that the shooter had purchased a large amount of ammunition and an aftermarket trigger.",
      "Second Amendment expert Ian Bartrum, an emeritus law professor at the University of Las Vegas, noted that while the circumstances of how the suspect bought the gun used in the New York mass shooting are murky, he was legally allowed to carry and transport it within the state under Nevada law.",
      "\"It's the Wild West,\" he said. Tamura's right to transport the weapon across state lines would have been subject to gun bans and other controls on the books in states he drove through, but so in practice, such restrictions would be difficult to enforce.",
      "It is illegal in New York to possess or transport assault-style weapons, but the state law is not designed to stop a shooter who drives into New York from out of state, as Tamura did.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called for a national assault weapon ban, posting on social media \"a gunman from a state with weak gun laws brought an AR-15 to New York.\"",
      "There has not been a national assault weapons ban in the U.S. since the last one expired in 2004. Former President Joe Biden, who was one of the architects of the 1994 ban, urged Congress to pass a new ban but lacked the political support for it. In 2022, Biden signed the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun control legislation in three decades, which enhanced background checks for gun buyers under 21 years of age, provided billions for mental health services and closed the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" to prevent convicted domestic abusers from purchasing a firearm for five years.",
      "During his first term, President Trump signed a ban on bump stocks \u2014 which was later overturned by the Supreme Court, another indication of the challenges facing gun legislation. In 2022, the Supreme Court struck down a 108-year-old New York law that limited who can obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun in public. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said New York's \"proper-cause requirement\" prevented law-abiding citizens from exercising their Second Amendment right, and held its licensing regime is unconstitutional.",
      "A May 2022 CBS News poll found 54% of Americans want stricter gun laws, while 30% want to keep the laws as they are and 16% want less strict laws. But passing any type of gun control legislation remains difficult, with CBS News polling in 2022 showing deep partisan divides among Americans on the issue. Even if Democrats, who largely support gun control measures, held majorities in Congress, they would likely need to win the support of Republican senators to secure the 60 votes necessary to allow the consideration of any such bill.",
      "Although Nevada has some libertarian characteristics, Bartrum said the state's gun laws are considered more middle of\u00a0 the road for the U.S. \u2014 even though\u00a0 Las Vegas suffered the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, when a gunman opened fire on a music festival in 2017, killing 58 people and wounding nearly 500.",
      "Before the Las Vegas shooting, Nevada voters approved a ballot initiative for background checks, which then-state Attorney General Adam Laxalt declared enforceable. But Nevada's state government in 2019 ushered in new gun control measures, including background checks on private sales and transfers and some \"red flag\" legislation, according to the Nevada Independent. Under red-flag laws, courts can issue orders for the seizure of guns from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.",
      "Bartrum said that there has been \"pretty broad bipartisan support for even things like background checks,\" which he described as \"not particularly controversial or onerous.\" But he noted that it has been nearly impossible to enact new gun legislation.",
      "\"Despite that the technology is ever moving forward, the law is sort of stuck in 1865,\" he said. \"So it's a pretty, pretty \u2026 illogical system of regulation.\"",

Mr. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case.",

Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida, is the one \"who targeted and preyed upon\" then 16-year-old Giuffre in 2000, the family said.",

      "Maxwell's lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions \"about 100 different people.\" They have said she's willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions.",
      "A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family's statement was sent to Maxwell's attorney Thursday.",
      "A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell.",
      "Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates.",
      "Giuffre called Maxwell \"the mastermind\" behind the alleged sex trafficking in an interview with CBS News' Gayle King in 2020.",
      "\"She is a monster. She's worse than Epstein. She did things even worse than Epstein did. She was vicious. She was evil. And she's a woman,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Giuffre also told King that Maxwell could incriminate \"very well-known\" people.",
      "Giufree previously said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre's credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a \"substantial donation\" to her survivors' organization.",
      "The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein's prolonged downfall.",
      "Her family's statement said she endured death threats and financial ruin over her cooperation with authorities against Epstein and Maxwell.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee are heading to Gaza on Friday to survey food and aid distribution sites and meet with people living there, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Their visit is prompted by a dire humanitarian crisis, as children and adults in Gaza are struggling to survive off insufficient food and the death toll for people trying to get aid in Gaza mounts. President Trump said earlier this week that the U.S. and Israel will partner to run new food centers in the region, but he said Israel would preside over the centers to \"make sure the distribution is proper.\"",
      "Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee have been in Israel meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders about the situation in Gaza. Netanyahu has said, incorrectly, that there is \"no starvation\" in Gaza, despite emerging photos of emaciated children and repeated warnings from food security experts.",
      "\"President Trump is a humanitarian with a big heart,\" Leavitt said during Thursday's White House press briefing. \"And that's why he sent special envoy Witkoff to the region in an effort to save lives and end this crisis. Tomorrow, special envoy Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee will be traveling into Gaza to inspect to the current distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food, and meet with local Gazans to hear firsthand about this dire situation on the ground. The special envoy and the ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "Leavitt said the administration will provide more details once the president approves a plan. She also said the meetings Witkoff and Huckabee have had with Netanyahu and other leaders have been productive.",
      "Mr. Trump earlier this week contradicted Netanyahu's assessment denying grave hunger in Gaza. The U.S. president said the children in Gaza \"look very hungry.\"",
      "\"There is real starvation in Gaza \u2014 you can't fake that,\" he told reporters.",
      "Also at issue is the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private food distribution organization that has faced\u00a0heavy criticism\u00a0for its food delivery methods and the number of people who have been\u00a0killed\u00a0trying to reach its distribution sites in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. and Israel have both supported the relatively new GHF to deliver aid in Gaza over the United Nations. A group of Democratic senators, led by Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, is urging the Trump administration to \"immediately cease all U.S. funding for GHF and resume support for the existing UN-led aid coordination mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches civilians in need,\" the senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "A senior U.S. official told CBS News on Wednesday that the U.S. has committed $30 million for aid in Gaza and those funds would be distributed \"in the next day or so.\"",
      "\"The United States of America supports GHF, but we would support any other mechanism that delivers food and the other needs of the Gazan people in a safe, secure fashion that does not get manipulated or distorted or taken advantage of by Hamas, the official said, adding, \"I'd like to think that some of the NGOs that are not succeeding right now would turn to GHF and say, let's work together for the sake of the Gazans in Gaza.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A trio of federal judges on Thursday publicly detailed threats and harassment they have endured in recent months after handing down decisions against the Trump administration or speaking out against attacks on the federal judiciary, including receiving pizzas that purported to be sent from the late son of a New Jersey federal judge who was the target of an attack.",
      "The appearances marked the first time the judges have spoken out about the threats they've received, and marked the rare occasion of sitting members of the judiciary responding to the attacks leveled against them.",
      "During the course of his second term, President Trump, members of his administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill have lambasted judges who have issued rulings against the president's policies. Some GOP lawmakers have filed articles of impeachment against judges, and the Justice Department has lodged judicial misconduct complaints against two jurists who sit on the federal trial court in Washington, D.C.",
      "The event was hosted by Speak Up for Justice, an organization that seeks to voice support for the judiciary.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell, who is the chief judge of the court in Rhode Island, said he has received six credible death threats. He described one in which a person was searching for McConnell's home address because he wanted \"Smith & Wesson to pay me a visit.\"",
      "McConnell also received a voicemail \u2014 played during the forum \u2014 from a man that said, \"Tell that son of a b***h we're going to come for him,\" and \"how dare you try to put charges on Donald J. Trump.\" The caller continued, telling McConnell \"your ass is going to prison\" and \"I wish somebody would fucking assassinate your ass, someone needs to f**king wipe his ass out.\"",
      "The voicemail was one of more than 400 threatening messages that his court has received, McConnell said.",
      "\"It's daunting. It was frightening,\" he said in remarks during the forum. \"I've never had anyone threaten to put me in prison, threaten bodily injury, wishing that I was assassinated.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama, said it \"shook my faith in the judicial system and the rule of law.\"",
      "But McConnell said the \"most heartbreaking call\" he received was from the U.S. Marshals, who provide protection for federal judges, informing him that a pizza had been delivered to his home in the name of Daniel Anderl, the late son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas. Anderl was\u00a0killed when he answered the door at his family's New Jersey home\u00a0in 2020 and was shot by a disgruntled gunman who was\u00a0targeting Salas.",
      "CBS News reported in May that about two dozen judges nationwide had received unsolicited pizza deliveries in Anderl's name.",
      "Federal prosecutors have labeled the unsolicited pizza deliveries \"pizza doxxing\" \u2014 a spin on \"doxxing,\" in which somebody's address or other personal information is maliciously made public, often as a form of intimidation.",
      "A U.S. Marshals Service official told CBS News in May the agency \u2014 which handles judicial security \u2014 is \"looking into all the unsolicited pizza deliveries to federal judges and taking appropriate steps to address the matter.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik, who presides in Seattle, said that to his knowledge more than 50 judges nationwide have been pizza-doxxed, not including the judges' families and their associates. He said he and his children all received pizza boxes in Anderl's name after he gave press interviews about attacks on the judiciary.",
      "\"They're looking into it,\" Lasnik said about the U.S. Marshals' investigation. \"But it's very difficult in this day and age to track where these things originate.\"",
      "Lasnik said his colleagues handling cases involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been \"bombarded with hate mail and hate emails and threats.\"",
      "\"It's so discouraging to a young judge to suddenly not only worry about how do I do this job right, but how do I keep my family safe,\" he said.",
      "Salas spoke about the five-year anniversary of her son's death, which occurred in July 2020, and the increase in violent rhetoric in recent months that has led to more judges speaking out about the threats they have received.",
      "\"You know, we're seeing things coming out, from the top down, from White House spokespeople calling, you know, us crazy, leftist, unconstitutional judges,\" Salas said. \"And I think that we, in fairness, are nonpartisan, but we have to speak the facts. And the facts are that we have political leaders with large social platforms, political leaders with power, right? Calling us deranged and idiots, that is the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that I think caused the judges that are on here today to come forward.\"",
      "She urged the nation's political leaders to tone down the rhetoric and stop calling judges \"corrupt\" and \"biased.\"",
      "\"They are inviting people to do us harm, they are inviting that man to call you because now he feels emboldened to use those words against you, because our leaders are calling us idiots and deranged and monsters,\" she said. \"Don't make it personal. Appeal us to a higher court.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, also on the bench in Seattle, said he and his wife were \"swatted,\" an illegal scheme in which people make false emergency calls in an attempt to draw police SWAT teams to the homes of public figures.",
      "Recounting the incident, the judge, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, said law enforcement received a call that he had murdered his wife and arrived at their house with their weapons drawn.",
      "Shortly afterward, the FBI informed him that there was a bomb in his house, Coughenour said.",
      "\"What kind of people do these things?\" he said during the forum. \"It's just so disgusting and it's really unspeakable that people will do these things.\"",
      "Coughenour said that through his decades as a federal judge, he repeatedly heard jurists in other countries discuss how admired the U.S. judiciary was.",
      "But he said it's \"stunning to me how much damage has been done to the reputation of our judiciary, because some political actors think they can gain some advantage by attacking the independence of the judiciary and threatening the rule of law.\"",
      "Coughenour issued a call for lawyers and fellow judges to speak out against the attacks on the judiciary and say \"not in this country and not on our watch.\"",
      "The attacks appear to go beyond threats and harassment and also seek to inflict professional punishments on the judges. McConnell said he was the subject of judicial misconduct complaints filed by America First Legal, a conservative organization that was run by Stephen Miller, and two members of Congress. Miller now serves as White House deputy chief of staff.",
      "Both McConnell and Coughenour are overseeing cases that challenge policies implemented by the second Trump administration. Coughenour in February issued a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship and McConnell in March blocked the White House's freeze on federal funding.",
      "The Justice Department appealed both decisions and legal proceedings are ongoing.",
      "Threats to federal judges have steadily risen over the last six years, according to the Marshals. A vulnerability management program run by the federal judiciary that was established after the death of Salas' son provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report released in March.",
      "In 2022, after the leak of a draft Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, a California man armed with a gun, knife and various tools was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Maryland home. The man was charged with attempted murder and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Salas told CBS News that it's not just federal judges who are targeted \u2014 state judges are now being pizza-doxxed, including those in Florida and Colorado.",
      "Colorado Chief Justice Monica Marquez has \"gotten so many pizzas she's stopped counting,\" said Salas. Marquez cast a deciding vote in a 4-3 decision by Colorado's Supreme Court in December 2023 to disqualify then-candidate Trump from the Colorado ballot before the 2024 election. The court found that Mr. Trump was ineligible for the presidency under the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment, a decision that was ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court.",
      "Marquez spoke about the toll of that vote\u00a0in November 2024, which she knew could be the most consequential of her career. She described how she was late for the court's conference that day because \"I was in my chambers bathroom vomiting from the stress. I knew exactly what was on the line.\"",
      "In Florida, two state judges were targeted with pizzas, some also in the name of Salas' son. A 49-year-old man, Jonathan Mark Miller, has been charged with \"fraudulent use of personal information\" for the orders that targeted the judges.",
      "But Salas said this accountability is rare.",
      "\"State bad actors have been caught,\" she said, but the acts of intimidation against federal judges have come from \"unknown sources.\"",
      "\"That troubles me,\" Salas said, \"because we don't know who is doing this. We don't know whether this is a group of bad actors, a few bad actors. But clearly judges are being targeted, and the message is clear.\"",

    "summary": "The workforce of a federal agency that oversees billions in grants for primary health care, AIDS/HIV, maternal and child health services, and workforce training has been slashed, sparking fears of what's to come.",
    "story": [
      "A little-known federal agency that sends more than $12 billion annually to support community health centers, addiction treatment services, and workforce initiatives for America's neediest people has been hobbled by the Trump administration's staffing purges.",
      "The cuts are \"just a little astonishing,\" said Carole Johnson, who previously led the Health Resources and Services Administration. She left the agency in January with the administration change and has described the sweeping staff cuts as a \"big threat\" to the agency's ability to distribute billions of dollars in grants to hospitals, clinics, nonprofits, and other organizations nationwide.",
      "Since February, about a quarter of workers at HRSA \u2014 including analysts, auditors, scientists, grant managers, and nursing consultants \u2014 have left, according to a KFF Health News analysis.",
      "The agency, headquartered in a nondescript gray-and-glass office building tucked into side streets in Rockville, Maryland, employed about 2,700 staffers in early 2025. Employees worked behind the scenes to manage and monitor thousands of projects nationwide that fund primary health providers, HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, maternal and child care programs, rural hospitals, and workforce training.",
      "On the ground, HRSA's grants have helped create telehealth initiatives for mothers in rural New Mexico, funded workforce training for Indigenous nurses in South Dakota, and supported Healthy Start programs for expectant mothers and babies in places like rural Georgia.",
      "Ryan Alcorn, a co-founder and the chief executive of GrantExec, a company that helps organizations match and apply for funding, said every American benefits from the programs HRSA's funding supports: \"When the safety net fails, hospitals become overwhelmed, unpaid costs rise, and premiums go up for everyone.\"",
      "Several former HRSA leaders, who have been in touch with employees, confirmed the magnitude of the cuts estimated by KFF Health News. Johnson said she believes the actual number of workers lost is larger.",
      "More than 700 workers were fired or chose to leave from February through the end of June. The analysis is based on data from the HHS employee directory, which may not include workers who opted out of being listed, and may not be an exact count of the worker roster, which is in flux.",
      "Johnson, who is now a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, and several other former employees interviewed by KFF Health News said they are concerned that specific programs will be eliminated, but also that reduced staffing could affect ongoing program oversight. The agency's workforce ethos, Johnson said, is one in which \"if there were two people left at HRSA, they would work around the clock to try to get the money out.\"",
      "For at least one program, revealed during a tense moment on Capitol Hill in July, money to help low-income and minority students has already stopped flowing to colleges and universities. The Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students program, established through congressional legislation, helped schools pay for students to train to become dentists, physician assistants, midwives, and nurses \u2014 all of whom are in short supply in rural and some urban areas. Candice Chen, acting associate administrator of HRSA's health workforce bureau, confirmed the agency \"did have competitions that were canceled.\"",
      "When U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) asked whether they were canceled by the Trump administration, Chen paused before speaking again: \"Well, the funding decisions were made across the administration.\"",
      "Asked about the canceled funding, officials from several schools declined to comment. Patrick Gonzales, a spokesperson for the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, said in an emailed statement that the school is \"helping students navigate this transition with clarity and care.\"",
      "U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) has called for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s resignation or firing, \"whichever one comes first,\" saying there was \"no defensible answer\" to eliminating thousands of workers across federal agencies.",
      "In April, nearly a dozen Democratic senators sent a letter to Kennedy demanding answers about the mass firings, noting HRSA is the \"primary agency tasked with improving access to health care for vulnerable populations.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to the senators' letter. Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services \"has refused to answer basic questions about why the administration conducted mass firings in this office,\" said Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.).",
      "President Trump's proposed fiscal 2026 budget eliminates HRSA as well as some of its programs, including grants to rural hospitals, workforce training, Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs, and emergency medical services for children. HRSA spokesperson Andrea Takash said in an emailed response that HHS is \"undertaking organizational changes that support multiple goals while ensuring continuity of essential services.\"",
      "HRSA continues to process new funding announcements and awards for the health centers, workforce programs, child and maternal health initiatives, and \"many more of our critical programs and services,\" Takash said.",
      "HRSA's largest bureau supports thousands of community health centers that serve over 31 million people nationwide. Before the end of September, the agency's grants are still scheduled to pay out billions more to health clinics and other organizations nationwide.",
      "Cuts to health centers could come under more scrutiny because their funding has \"a lot of bipartisan\" support, said Celli Horstman, a senior research associate at the Commonwealth Fund, a health research nonprofit. HRSA's funding, which includes Section 330 grants, goes to \"keeping the doors open\" at federally qualified health centers nationwide, Horstman said.",
      "An additional 42% of health center funding comes from Medicaid, a federal and state insurance program that covers people with low incomes and those with disabilities, she said. Congress recently voted to reduce Medicaid funding.",
      "Joe Stevens, spokesperson for the Virginia Community Healthcare Association, said health centers are rethinking \"how they do business\" because of the Medicaid cuts and the increased administrative challenges faced when processing their HRSA grants, which have been more challenging to obtain since February. Virginia's health clinics treat about 400,000 people annually, Stevens said.",
      "\"It's a system that's been in place for 50-plus years, and this is the first time they're having issues receiving their funds,\" he said, noting that clinics now must also provide an itemized list of how the money is to be used after grants have been approved.",
      "\"Our health centers are understaffed, so having somebody to have to enter that information every two weeks is just more time,\" Stevens said.",
      "For months, HRSA staff across all departments have worked through changes to their technology systems and transitioned work to others as employees left their jobs. Workers have continued to process grants despite a February executive order that froze federal funding and a March announcement that HHS would lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies \u2014 including HRSA.",
      "One former employee said that, at this point, \"all we're doing now is keeping the lights on.\"",
      "Michael Warren, who left the agency in June, ran HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Warren described the bureau's staffing cuts as \"substantial.\" The bureau awarded more than $628 million in grants between Oct. 1, 2024, and July 22, 2025, to programs that included providing block grants to states and funding home visiting programs, through which trained staffers work with families with young children.",
      "Warren, who is now the chief medical and health officer for the March of Dimes, said America faces a crisis as one of the \"most dangerous places in the world to give birth among other high-income countries, and that shouldn't be the case.\"",
      "With tears brimming, Warren said his former employees \"wake up every morning, they work all day, and they go to sleep every night thinking about what they can do for mothers, children, and families.\"",
      "Methodology",
      "For this article, KFF Health News calculated workforce reductions at the Health Resources and Services Administration using public information from the Department of Health and Human Services directory posted online.

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday sharply probed\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as higher duties are set to snap into place Friday for countries that have not yet reached trade deals with the administration.",
      "The 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "As arguments got underway, several judges on the appeals court peppered Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, about whether IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs.",
      "One judge immediately noted that the law has never before been used to assess the levies on trading partners.",
      "Many other laws regulating trade include the word \"tariff,\" the judge said, \"but here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them.\"",
      "Pointing to those trade statutes, which impose constraints on the duties that a president can assess, one of the judges questioned why a president would rely on those laws when IEEPA provides broader power under the Justice Department's interpretation.",
      "\"Your argument dislocates that entire U.S. trade-relief framework,\" he said.",
      "Later, looking at the harmonized tariff schedule, which sets tariff rates and categories for merchandise imported into the U.S., members of the court criticized the scope of Mr. Trump's levies, which cover nearly every country.",
      "\"It's a wholesale revision of the scheme that Congress enacted,\" a judge said, adding, \"it's really kind of asking for an extraordinary change\" to the legislature's approach to the tariff schedule.",
      "Other members of the Federal Circuit seemed concerned with the breadth of authority the president was claiming in relying on IEEPA to impose broad tariffs on trading partners.",
      "\"It seems to me you're asking for unbounded authority,\" one judge told Shumate.",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday for countries the administration has not reached trade agreements with.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy. Shumate argued before the Federal Circuit that courts should not second-guess the president's determination that trade deficits are an emergency, and some of the judges seemed inclined to agree that the consequences of those imbalances would fit within IEEPA's framework.",
      "He also said that the emergency powers law authorizes a president to \"regulate ... any ... importation,\" and that covers the imposition of tariffs.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"That is a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,\" Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small businesses, told the Federal Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Federal Circuit will rule.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely watched Consumer Price Index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily imported items such as appliances, furniture and toys increased.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri joined Democrats Wednesday to advance legislation that would ban members of Congress from buying, selling or owning individual stocks.",
      "In an 8-7 vote, Hawley and Senate Democrats on the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs voted the legislation out of committee, with all other Republicans on the committee voting against it. It's not yet clear if the legislation, which Hawley introduced, will receive a floor vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "\"I practice what I preach,\" Hawley said in an awkward exchange with fellow Republicans on the panel. \"I don't have individual stocks, I don't trade in stocks. I'm not a billionaire, unlike others on this committee. And what I think is, the American people are sending us a clear message.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who was not born wealthy but is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to his public filings, said he agrees lawmakers shouldn't be trading stocks. But he defended the ability for members of Congress to be rich, and called attacks on the wealthy \"disgusting.\"",
      "\"He made a reference to billionaires, okay?\" Scott said of Hawley. \"I don't know when in this country it became a negative to make money. But somehow, if you've made money, you're supposedly \u2014 I think Senator Hawley suggests \u2014 you shouldn't be serving, because you might trade stocks.\"",
      "\"Anybody want to be poor? I don't.\" Scott continued. \"Right? So this idea that we're going to attack people because they make money is wrong. Is absolutely wrong. We should cherish all of our different backgrounds. ... So, I think it's disgusting what is going on here.\"",
      "Some Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee insisted that blind trusts are sufficiently restrictive. But Hawley said blind trusts are \"often workarounds,\" and members can still influence decisions.",
      "The measure, originally called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from trading or holding individual stocks, giving them 180 days to sell their stocks. Members would also have to supply their House or Senate ethics committee with written certification of compliance each year, and the Government Accountability Office would conduct a compliance audit every two years. Hawley, as a part of negotiations with Democrats, agreed to call it the Honest Act.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced support for the legislation in a statement.",
      "\"While I appreciate the creativity of my Republican colleagues in drafting legislative acronyms, I welcome any serious effort to raise ethical standards in public service,\" Pelosi said.",
      "Hawley also said the legislation would ban the next president and vice president from holding or trading individual stocks while in office, meaning the legislation wouldn't affect President Trump. A reporter asked the president if he supports Hawley's bill.",
      "\"Well, I like it conceptually,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know about it. But I like it conceptually.\"",
      "But later in the afternoon, Mr. Trump went off on Hawley on Truth Social with a very different tone than he took only hours earlier, calling him a \"second-tier Senator.\"",
      "\"The Democrats, because of our tremendous ACHIEVEMENTS and SUCCESS, have been trying to 'Target' me for a long period of time, and they're using Josh Hawley, who I got elected TWICE, as a pawn to help them,\" the president wrote. \"I wonder why Hawley would pass a Bill that Nancy Pelosi is in absolute love with \u2014 He is playing right into the dirty hands of the Democrats. It's a great Bill for her, and her 'husband,' but so bad for our Country!\"",
      "Hawley on Thursday said he had a visit with Mr. Trump Wednesday night, following the president's Truth Social post. According to Hawley, Mr. Trump said that senators told him, falsely, that the bill would force him to sell all of his assets and properties, including his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "\"And so I said, 'Well, that's just false. It explicitly exempts you and all your assets,'\" Hawley told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. \"So we walked through that and he was like oh, that was not what he had been told.\"",
      "Hawley said the president told him he wants to see a ban on stock trading.",
      "\"He reiterated to me that he wants a stock trade ban, he supports a stock trade ban,\" Hawley told reporters.",
      "Hawley introduced similar legislation in 2023, but it didn't make it out of committee.",
      "The proposed measure is more restrictive than the\u00a0STOCK Act, which requires lawmakers and senior government officials including the president and vice president to disclose their stock trades and bans them from trading on information they learn in the course of their public service.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration filed a complaint Monday against Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move that follows clashes in court between the D.C.-based federal judge and the government over President Trump's deportation policies.",
      "It's rare for the Justice Department to formally accuse judges of misconduct. The move will kick off a long, complex review process \u2014 though some legal experts say the Trump administration could have a difficult time demonstrating that Boasberg violated judicial rules.",
      "Why did the Trump administration file a complaint against Boasberg?",
      "The complaint accuses Boasberg of \"making improper public comments\" about Mr. Trump, and criticizes the judge's rulings in a high-profile case involving Venezuelan migrants who were deported to El Salvador, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Much of the complaint focuses on a March session of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a panel of federal judges led by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts that weighs in on how the judicial branch is run.",
      "The Justice Department accused Boasberg of speaking up during one part of the biannual meeting to warn that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts,\" leading to a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "The source of those quotes is unclear, but they were first reported earlier this month by The Federalist, a conservative digital outlet that says it obtained a memo summarizing the meeting. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for further details.",
      "Those comments, the government argues, violated rules requiring judges to avoid publicly comment on cases and to \"act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\"",
      "The complaint also takes issue with Boasberg's handling of Venezuelan migrants who were rapidly flown to a Salvadoran prison under the wartime Alien Enemies Act in mid-March, less than a week after the Judicial Conference meeting.",
      "Boasberg verbally ordered the government to return the migrants to the U.S., even if officials needed to \"turn the planes around,\" but the deportees were still sent to El Salvador. Since then, the judge has accused the administration of defying his orders, and has threatened to hold the government in contempt.",
      "The Justice Department argued Monday that Boasberg \"rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond.\"",
      "\"Judge \u202fBoasberg publicly forecasted his baseless predictions of presidential lawlessness, then issued erroneous rulings based on that preconceived notion,\" says the complaint, which was signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by Boasberg blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, deciding the lawsuit should have been brought in Texas, not Washington, D.C.",
      "Legal experts say Boasberg complaint is misdirected",
      "Several legal experts told CBS News the complaint could face a tough path.",
      "Federal law defines judicial misconduct as \"conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts.\" That covers everything from harassment to making partisan statements and treating people in a \"demonstrably egregious and hostile manner.\"",
      "Several law professors say that the parts of Monday's complaint that focus on Boasberg's handling of the deportation case are misdirected.",
      "In general, if a party in a federal case has issues with how a judge has ruled, they're expected to file an appeal \u2014 not a complaint against a judge \u2014 said Jeffrey Bellin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who has served as a judicial ethics investigator.",
      "\"You're not supposed to use the misconduct process to complain about the judge's behavior in the case that you're involved in,\" Bellin told CBS News.",
      "The parts of the complaint that criticize Boasberg for warning the Trump administration may defy court orders are less straightforward, says Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor.",
      "The government accused the Obama-appointed judge of violating a section of the code of conduct for federal judges that says they \"should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.\"",
      "Geyh said that in some circumstances, Boasberg's comments could be \"a potential problem.\"",
      "But he still doesn't believe Boasberg deserves disciplinary action. He said courts have been \"overwhelmed\" by Trump-era executive actions, \"many of which are of dubious constitutionality,\" and need to figure out how to preserve their legitimacy and ensure their rulings are followed.",
      "\"They need to talk about it somehow,\" said Geyh.",
      "Also, while public comments about cases aren't allowed, if Boasberg's remarks were made in a session of the normally private Judicial Conference, \"you could make a pretty good argument, I think, that that is something different,\" Geyh said.",
      "Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said remarks at Judicial Conference meetings typically aren't meant for public consumption.",
      "She also argued Boasberg's alleged comments about the risk of the Trump administration skirting court orders are based on \"very real concerns.\"",
      "\"This is not a novel issue being raised by one particular judge about, 'what if the administration doesn't comply,'\" said Levenson.",
      "What happens next?",
      "It's a complicated process that can take months.",
      "When a complaint is filed, the first step is usually for the region's chief appellate court judge \u2014 in this case, Judge Sri Srinivasin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \u2014 to review the issue and decide how to proceed.",
      "In the vast majority of situations, the misconduct complaint is dismissed at that stage, Geyh said, noting that many complaints are from \"disgruntled litigants who don't like how their case went, and so they kvetch about what went on in their case.\"",
      "The appeals court judge can also privately take corrective action before the issue escalates. For example, they can encourage the judge to admit their mistake, said Geyh.",
      "If the appellate judge decides a complaint has merit, they can refer it to a special committee of judges to conduct an investigation and make recommendations. Then, the region's judicial council \u2014 yet another committee of judges \u2014 decides whether to punish them.",
      "\"The quickest thing is if they dismiss it,\" Bellin said. \"If they don't dismiss it \u2026 we won't hear about it for a while.\"",
      "How can judges be punished for misconduct?",
      "First off, district court judges can't be fired \u2014 unless they're impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, which requires two-thirds of senators to vote in favor.",
      "\"It's very hard to discipline a sitting federal judge because they have life tenure,\" said Bellin.",
      "Short of that, a judge found to have engaged in misconduct can be publicly censured or reprimanded, or barred from taking on any new cases. The judicial conference can also choose to refer a judge to Congress for impeachment proceedings.",
      "How common are judicial misconduct complaints?",
      "They're not unheard of, though punishments are rare.",
      "Last year, Boston-based U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor was the subject of a misconduct complaint after he criticized Supreme Court Justice Alito in a New York Times op-ed. An appellate judge didn't take further action because Ponsor apologized.",
      "Bellin said it's \"pretty common\" for parties in cases to file complaints about judges, but \"these are not usually done by people who are professional litigators.\" Instead, most attorneys just work their issues with judges into their appeals.",
      "It's especially unusual for the Justice Department to file complaints.",
      "\"You just don't have a history of the Justice Department having an acrimonious relationship with the judiciary,\" said Geyh. \"Historically, it's just a dumb thing to do. You want an amicable relationship with the judges who are going to be deciding your cases. You don't want to be suing them. You don't want to be filing complaints against them.\"",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has been more openly critical of judges than his predecessors.",
      "Besides Boasberg, the Trump administration filed a misconduct complaint in February against D.C. District Judge Ana Reyes, accusing her of \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" during a hearing. The D.C. appeals court has not addressed the complaint.",
      "The administration also sued every judge in Maryland over a standing order in that court district blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removal.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and his staff have lashed out at judges who have ruled against the government. The president has called for Boasberg to be impeached.",
      "\"It strikes me as a bit of posturing, as an aggressive pushback by the administration against the federal judges,\" Levenson said of the complaint against Boasberg. \"I think it's a real uphill battle for the administration, but the mere filing of the complaint is sort of the shot across the bow.\"",

      "The stock market's rise has more people rating its condition positively along with that.",
      "But that also speaks to the ongoing differences between people of different income levels. People with higher incomes are more apt to say the market's moves impact them.",
      "Over recent years the stock market's ups and downs haven't connected that strongly with views of the economy; Americans have often reported that inflation and prices have more impact, and not all Americans own stocks. That said, as the market has pushed to recent highs of late, today Americans who say their finances are impacted by the market are also more likely to say those finances are good. They also give better ratings to the national economy.",

      "A great deal of the economy depends on spending, of course. A quarter of Americans say they're planning a large purchase \u2014 something they need to save for or to finance \u2014 in the coming months.",
      "People in comparably lower income levels are less positive about the state of the economy and more inclined to be cutting back on optional purchases.",
      "The factors that impact decisions about large purchases, generally, are their savings level and their outlook for inflation, even more so than things like interest rates (though that is a factor too), and much more than the stock market.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:07:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The origin of potatoes has puzzled scientists for years, but researchers now say they've found an unlikely ancestor: tomatoes.",
    "story": [
      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",
      "\"Wild potatoes are very difficult to sample, so this dataset represents the most comprehensive collection of wild potato genomic data ever analyzed,\" said the paper's first author, Zhiyang Zhang of the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen.",
      "Outside of the ancestry, there's also a linguistic similarity, according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\"The word 'tomato' started out as 'tomate' and came from the Nahuatl word 'tomatl.' Since the potato had been introduced to the English some decades earlier, the word evolved to mimic the form of 'potato' \u2014 hence the spelling 'tomato,'\" the dictionary notes.",

    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

      "It will take the Crew Dragon 16 hours to catch up with the station early Saturday. After passing about 1,200 feet directly below the outpost, Endeavour will loop up, cross in front of the lab and then on up to a point directly above the forward Harmony module's space-facing port. From there, it will move straight down for docking.",
      "The crew will be welcomed aboard by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand will be Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Also on board: clothing and personal items for Cardman that were launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, turning 38, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock around Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "Planning for months in orbit",
      "It's not yet known how long Crew 11 will be on board the space station.",
      "Up to this point, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit starting with the Crew 12 mission next year.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25 percent while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three and perhaps just two, one American and one Russian. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money. But it would sharply reduce the amount of research that could be carried out.",
      "No final decisions have been made.",
      "\"When we launch ... we have a six-month mission duration that we baseline,\" said Stich. \"We can extend the mission in real time as needed as we better understand the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"",
      "For her part, Cardman said she would welcome an additional two months in orbit.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" she said. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On the campaign trail, Donald Trump made a pledge: Under his leadership, in vitro fertilization would be covered for all women and couples seeking the treatment. \"We are going to be paying for that treatment,\" he said in an interview in August 2024.",
      "After taking office, President Trump signed an executive order directing his domestic policy council to make recommendations on IVF policy changes by May. But that deadline has come and gone, and the White House has said little about the issue. Advocates for better IVF coverage are wondering what the holdup is.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has called himself the \"father of IVF\" and claimed to be a \"leader on fertilization, IVF,\" told NBC News, during that 2024 interview, that IVF would be covered for everyone who needs it.",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,\" Mr. Trump, then a candidate, said. He added, \"We're going to be paying for that treatment, or we're gonna be mandating that the insurance company pay.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order, signed in February, fell short of his campaign pledge, stating that it would be administration policy \"to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\"",
      "He directed his assistant for the White House Domestic Policy Council to submit within 90 days \"recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.\"",
      "That deadline would have fallen on May 19. Asked for an update, the White House declined to comment.",
      "Cristina Gonzales and her partner, who live in New York City, have been struggling with infertility for about three years. Gonzales, who makes campaign ads for Democrats, is a part of a support group for women over 40 going through IVF. The women represent diverse political and ideological backgrounds, including liberals and those who support Mr. Trump, alike. When then-candidate Trump said IVF would be covered, Gonzales said some in her group \"believed completely and wholeheartedly\" that he would make coverage free.",
      "\"They deserve that promise to be kept,\" Gonzales said.",
      "\"This struggle of IVF is nonpartisan,\" she said. \"It affects everybody.\"",
      "In February, a Washington Post interview with Trump supporter and fired federal worker Ryleigh Cooper went viral. She said she didn't want to vote for Mr. Trump, but he'd promised to make IVF free. After reading the fact sheet from Mr. Trump's February executive order, she told the Post she said, \"'That's bullsh**.'\"",
      "IVF is a fertility treatment that has broad support; in 2023, over 95,000 babies were born as a result of IVF \u2014 about 2.6% of all births in the U.S. \u2014 according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",
      "An overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 86% \u2014 think IVF should be legal, according to a March 2024 CBS News/YouGov poll.",
      "\"Eighty-six percent of Americans support IVF. That is unheard of in almost any issue you could think of in modern times,\" said Danielle Melfi, CEO of infertility advocacy nonprofit RESOLVE.",
      "According to an April 2024 Pew survey, 79% of Democrats and those who lean Democratic say access to IVF is a good thing, as do 63% of Republicans and those who lean Republican. Even among Americans who told Pew abortion should be illegal in most cases, 60% view IVF access positively.",
      "And Mr. Trump has introduced other concepts, including a \"baby bonus\" for babies born in the U.S., to help boost the U.S. birth rate. The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024, with fewer than 1.6 children being born per woman, according to new federal data. The bonus is available to parents who open so-called Trump Accounts, which were introduced in the president's massive domestic policy bill that he signed into law last month.",
      "Melfi is optimistic about the momentum the issue has picked up and has made recommendations to the White House, among them, to increase health insurance coverage of all fertility-related treatment, include fertility coverage for veterans and military families, and cover fertility care for all federal employees.",
      "Out-of-pocket costs are the biggest barrier to undergoing IVF, Melfi said. Each cycle \u2014 and many couples undergo several cycles \u2014 costs between $12,000 and $25,000. Very few states require insurance companies to provide coverage for the treatment, so the vast majority of women and couples must pay out of pocket for IVF rounds.",
      "\"Each state looks a little bit different, which is why action at the federal level would be really meaningful,\" Melfi said of state laws governing insurance coverage of IVF.",
      "IVF is one of multiple infertility treatments available, and is often the last \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 step women take to become pregnant.",
      "In the process, a woman typically administers expensive shots to herself every day to stimulate the growth of multiple eggs at once and regularly goes to a fertility clinic for ultrasounds and blood work to monitor progress. The eggs are retrieved, fertilized outside of the body and ideally, they develop into healthy embryos that can be implanted immediately or frozen for later use.",
      "Many find it to be an exhausting process \u2014 physically, emotionally and financially.",
      "Leading up to her first round of IVF, Gonzales was anxious. What if she and her partner were to spend all this money only for the procedure to not result in pregnancy?",
      "\"I don't have enough money for this and I feel like there's a lot of pressure on my body \u2014 what if it doesn't perform?\" she said.",
      "For her, an unexpected year-end bonus had provided a way to pay. But otherwise, it might not have been possible.",
      "\"When you look at health insurance policies, almost none of them cover fertility,\" Gonzales said. \"Even so-called progressive states.\"",

      "Officials said Clinton David Brink, 43, was the first to be attacked. His wife, Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, guided their two children to safety before returning in an attempt to help her husband, authorities said during a news conference.",
      "\"The mother did not return all the way to the car with the kids,\" Maj. Stacie Rhoads with the Arizona State Police Criminal Investigation Division said. \"We believe that the mother took them to safety and then returned to help her husband.\" The children were found about a half mile into the park.",

      "McGann appeared in court for the first time on Thursday. He was charged with two counts of capital murder, the Associated Press reported. The judge ordered that he be held without bond at the Washington County Detention Center and assigned him a public defender. McGann's arraignment was set for Aug. 25.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 73,000 jobs in July, a slowdown from previous months and a sign the labor market is downshifting.",
      "The numbers",
      "Hiring was weaker\u00a0than expected by economists, who had forecast payroll gains of 115,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, up from 4.1% in June.",
      "The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring earlier this year was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the figures show that the private sector added only 3,000 jobs in June.",
      "Factoring in the downward revisions, the three-month average employment gain from May to June was 35,000, compared to an average of 123,000 from January to April.",
      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains \u00a0in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cut in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners is weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policy makers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",
      "\"With this morning's payroll miss \u2014 and the downward revisions that came with it \u2014 the Fed will again need to balance a slowing job market with inflation which isn't slowing fast enough,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",

    "summary": "Millions of borrowers in forbearance through the SAVE plan will see interest start accruing on Friday. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting today, Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",
      "How much will my payment increase?",
      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",
      "Borrowers should evaluate the four repayment plans available, which can be found at here at the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said.",
      "Changing plans will depend on your situation, added Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit that provides free advice for student borrowers.",
      "Borrowers who are seeking loan forgiveness, which can be earned after repaying a loan for anywhere from 10 years to 25 years, depending on the plan, may want switch because \"the SAVE forbearance doesn't count towards the payments needed to get the balance forgiven under those plans,\" she said.",
      "What about the new Repayment Assistance Plan?",
      "There's also a new repayment plan in the works that borrowers could consider, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which is due in 2026 and is part of the \"big beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4.",
      "\"For earners who make less than $10,000, their [monthly] payment will be $10 under RAP,\" Hubert said.",
      "For those with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $10,000 per year, the repayments will be based on 1% to 10% of their income minus $50 in payments each month for each child the borrower has. \"With that in mind, we can estimate that a borrower who has an AGI of $45,000 and no children would have their monthly payment set at $150,\" she added.",
      "RAP payments could carry a higher monthly payment for some borrowers than under the SAVE plan, but the SAVE plan is likely to eventually be eliminated due to the court cases, Mayotte said.",
      "\"At a minimum, I would suggest trying to make payments that cover the monthly interest as it begins to accrue to prevent your balance from growing,\" Hubert added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-trade-deals-tariffis-deadline/",
    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately.",
      "Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "story": [
      "Two wildfires burning in the western United States \u2014 including one that has become a \"megafire\" on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon \u2014 are so hot that they're spurring the formation of \"fire clouds\" that can create their own erratic weather systems.",
      "In Arizona, the wind-whipped Dragon Bravo Fire that destroyed the Grand Canyon Lodge is 9% contained and has charred more than 164 square miles to become the largest fire now burning in the continental U.S. and one of the top 10 largest in recorded Arizona history. Getting around it would be roughly like driving from New York City to Washington, D.C.",
      "The formation of one such cloud was caught on video.",
      "Another large fire in Monroe, Utah, has burned 75 square miles since July 13 and is 11% contained, officials said Thursday. Evacuation orders were issued Wednesday for several towns in the fire's path, and scorched power poles prompted the shutoff of electricity in other nearby communities in south-central Utah.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox declared an emergency Thursday as wildfires grew around the state and planned to visit Monroe on Friday.",
      "Towering convection clouds known as pyrocumulus clouds have been spotted over Arizona's blaze for seven consecutive days, fueling the fire with dry, powerful winds, fire information officer Lisa Jennings said. They form when air over the fire becomes superheated and rises in a large smoke column. The giant billowing clouds can be seen for hundreds of miles and can resemble an anvil.",
      "Their more treacherous big brother, a fire-fueled thunderstorm known as the pyrocumulonimbus cloud, sent rapid winds shooting in all directions this week as a smoke column formed from the Utah fire then collapsed on itself, fire team information officer Jess Clark said.",
      "\"If they get high enough, they can also create downdrafts, and that's something we really watch out for because that can quickly spread the fire and can be very dangerous for firefighters who are doing their work on the ground,\" Jennings said.",
      "Multiple fire crews in Utah were forced to retreat Wednesday as the unpredictable climate created by the clouds threatened their safety, officials said. Fire crews in both Utah and Arizona had better control of the blazes, but containment has been slipping as the fires grow rapidly.",
      "The same type of cloud, which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has dubbed the \"fire-breathing dragon of clouds,\" recently formed a fire tornado that tore through an eastern Utah neighborhood with wind speeds estimated at 122 miles per hour.",
      "\"Think of the fire as kind of like a hot-air balloon, so it adds buoyancy and things rise as a result,\" said Derek Mallia, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Utah who studies pyrocumulus  clouds and tracks fires in Utah and Arizona. \"You get this towering thunderstorm over the fire, and just like any other thunderstorm it gets really windy underneath it. Because it's the West, these thunderstorms tend to be very dry.\"",
      "These clouds, he said, may appear more frequently as climate change\u00a0causes a longer fire season, drought conditions and extreme weather events.",
      "A megafire \u2014 although not a formal scientific term \u2014 generally is a fire that has burned at least 156 square miles, or about half the size of New York City.",
      "The Dragon Bravo Fire surpassed that mark in the latest update Thursday. It was sparked by lightning on July 4 and was being managed by the park to benefit the landscape.",
      "About a week later, officials switched to suppressing it as conditions deteriorated, with hot, dry and windy weather pushing the flames toward the Grand Canyon Lodge and the historic cabins that surround it. The fire destroyed dozens of buildings and forced the closure of the North Rim for the rest of the season as hundreds of firefighters struggled to gain an upper hand.",
      "Thursday marked the eighth straight day of historically dry conditions, Jennings said. Humidity levels have been in the single digits, fuel moisture levels are extremely low and wind gusts were expected to crank up to 35 miles per hour.",
      "The pyrocumulus clouds have reached heights of at least 25,000 feet, and fire behavior analyst Arthur Gonzales said they could go higher.",
      "The direction of the wind has been fairly consistent for crews working the Dragon Bravo Fire. Although they have been strong, the predictability has allowed fire managers to more easily position crews on the fire lines. But when pyrocumulus clouds form and the winds become less predictable, Jennings said, firefighters often have to be pulled back to safety.",
      "Hot, dry winds fanned the flames of the Monroe Canyon Fire on Thursday as firefighters worked to contain its spread. The fire has burned 12 power poles, and many homes have been without electricity since Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Other wildfires causing problems in Utah",

      "The power company, Garkane Energy Cooperative, said it's working to restore electricity as quickly as possible and has brought in backup generators.",
      "Marnie Reynolds, a resident of Antimony, worried for the town's many elderly residents. She's been using a camp stove to offer hot meals to neighbors and is using a generator to help people refrigerate groceries and medications.",

      "They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.",
      "In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.",
      "Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four-to five-years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range \"will be substantially higher,\" raising the risk Combs will flee.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21-to-27 months in prison.",
      "On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.",
      "Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \"lack of danger to any person or the community.\" But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.",
      "In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.",
      "He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a \"swingers\" lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot.",
      "They said he should also remain in prison as a danger to the community, a claim Agnifilo disputed in his papers.",
      "\"Sean Combs will not be violent to anyone. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,\" Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.",
      "Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.",
      "Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.",
      "\"The defendant's extensive history of violence - and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct - demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,\" they wrote. \"The defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",

      "Outside of the ancestry, there's also a linguistic similarity, according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\"The word 'tomato' started out as 'tomate' and came from the Nahuatl word 'tomatl.' Since the potato had been introduced to the English some decades earlier, the word evolved to mimic the form of 'potato' \u2014 hence the spelling 'tomato,'\" the dictionary notes.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced Thursday that a 90,000-square-foot ballroom with a capacity for 650 people will be constructed in the White House's East Wing. The approximately $200 million project will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "\"The White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in the world, yet the White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders and other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building's entrance,\" Leavitt said at Thursday's press briefing. \"The White House State Ballroom will be a much-needed and exquisite addition.\"",
      "Asked about it by reporters later in the day, Mr. Trump said, \"We've been planning it for a long time.\" He said the new ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building,\" which he called his \"favorite place.\"",
      "\"It won't be\u2014 it'll be near it, but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "It's unclear who the donors are as well as how the architects were chosen. The White House said McCrery Architects will be the lead architect, Clark Construction will oversee the construction and the engineering team will be led by AECOM.",
      "Construction is set to begin in September. The White House said Mr. Trump has held several meetings over the past few weeks with members of the White House staff, the National Park Service, the White House Military Office and the Secret Service to discuss design features and planning.",
      "\"The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it's theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical,\" the White House said in a release. \"The site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and has been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in 1942.\"",

      "The family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's most well-known sex trafficking accusers, expressed shock after President Trump said Giuffre was one of the employees Epstein \"stole\" from the spa at the president's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "Giuffre, who had accused Britain's Prince Andrew and other influential men of sexually exploiting her as a teenager trafficked by Epstein, has been a central figure in conspiracy theories tied to the case. She died by suicide this year.",
      "\"It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been 'stolen' from Mar-a-Lago,\" the family's statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump, responding to a reporter's question on Tuesday, said that he got upset with Epstein over his poaching of workers, including Giuffre, from his Palm Beach, Florida, club.",
      "The statement from Giuffre's family is the latest development involving Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges, and the Republican president, who was his one-time friend. Mr. Trump denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and said he cut off their relationship years ago, but he still faces questions about the case.",
      "Mr. Trump's comment \"makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions,\" the family's statement said. Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and other charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in Tallahassee, Florida, is the one \"who targeted and preyed upon\" then 16-year-old Giuffre in 2000, the family said.",
      "\"We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,\" it continued.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted the president was responding to a reporter's question and didn't bring up Giuffre himself.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,\" she said.",
      "Asked Thursday afternoon about Giuffre's family's statement, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know\" why Epstein had taken staff.",
      "\"I said if he's taken anybody from Mar-A-Lago, he's hiring or whatever he's doing, I didn't like it. And we threw him out, we said we didn't want him at the place,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I didn't like it that he was doing that.\"",
      "The family's statement comes shortly after the Justice Department interviewed Maxwell. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche questioned Maxwell over two days in a Florida courthouse, though details about what she said haven't become public.",
      "Maxwell's lawyers have said she testified truthfully and answered questions \"about 100 different people.\" They have said she's willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony and if lawmakers agree to satisfy other conditions.",
      "A message seeking comment about the Giuffre family's statement was sent to Maxwell's attorney Thursday.",
      "A Trump administration official said the president is not currently considering clemency action for Maxwell.",
      "Giuffre said she was approached by Maxwell in 2000 and eventually was hired by her as a masseuse for Epstein. But the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, she said, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates.",
      "Giuffre called Maxwell \"the mastermind\" behind the alleged sex trafficking in an interview with CBS News' Gayle King in 2020.",
      "\"She is a monster. She's worse than Epstein. She did things even worse than Epstein did. She was vicious. She was evil. And she's a woman,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Giuffre also told King that Maxwell could incriminate \"very well-known\" people.",
      "Giufree previously said she was flown around the world for appointments with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18 years old. The men, including Andrew, denied it and assailed Giuffre's credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account. The prince settled with Giuffre in 2022 for an undisclosed sum, agreeing to make a \"substantial donation\" to her survivors' organization.",
      "The American-born Giuffre lived in Australia for years and became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein's prolonged downfall.",
      "Her family's statement said she endured death threats and financial ruin over her cooperation with authorities against Epstein and Maxwell.",

      "President Trump on Thursday said he's giving Mexico an additional 90 days to strike a trade deal, with the announcement coming a day before his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the nation.",
      "Mr. Trump had said earlier this month that the 30% import duties would begin on Friday for Mexican imports, saying at the time that the country had not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "In his Thursday social media post, the president said he agreed to a 90-day extension during a phone conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, which he described as \"very successsful.\"",
      "The president has turned to tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he says are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline to strike new trade deals with Mexico and many other nations, the Trump administration has announced trade deals with\u00a0five Asian countries, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union.",
      "\"We will be talking to Mexico over the next 90 Days with the goal of signing a Trade Deal somewhere within the 90 Day period of time, or longer,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

      "Many economists project that tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices because the import duties are paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, which then pass on some or all of the costs to shoppers. While inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively muted, there are signs that the import duties are pushing some U.S. prices higher.",
      "For instance, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher in June. Many goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",

      "\"Lima is unique among Latin American capitals,\" Aliaga said, \"in that various archaeological finds are unearthed during nearly every civil project.\"",
      "The Peruvian capital of Lima, a city of more than 10 million people, has more than 400 archeological sites from the Inca era, the 15th century, or earlier, from the pre-Inca period, according to the Ministry of Culture.",
      "Astonishingly, Thursday's discovery was not the first time C\u00e1lidda, the company that distributes natural gas in Lima, has found archeological remains. Over more than two decades of excavation work to expand the underground network, the company says it has made more than 2,200 discoveries.",
      "Last month, utility workers found a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child aged between 10 and 15 while installing pipes. Archeologist Jesus Bahamonde told reporters at the time that the workers found the trunk of a huarango tree, \"which served as a tomb marker in the past.\"",

      "Witkoff and Huckabee visited a GHF site in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, according to an official involved with the visit. The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "\"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza - level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions, and meeting with (GHF) and other agencies. The purpose of the visit was to give (President Trump) a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza,\" Witkoff said on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump \"sent his envoy to serve as his eyes and ears on the ground, reflecting his deep concern and commitment to doing what's right,\" GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay said in a statement. \"We were honored to brief his delegation, share our operations, and demonstrate the impact of delivering 100 million meals to those who need them most.\"",
      "All four of the group's distribution sites are in zones controlled by the Israeli military. Throughout their months in operation, these sites have become flashpoints of desperation, with mass crowds of people gathering outside but who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, and GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to control crowds. But there has been a persistent pattern of people being killed by Israeli gunfire and even heavier weapons around the G.H.F. sites over the past five months, with the death toll in the hundreds.",
      "Witkoff's visit comes a week after U.S. officials walked away from ceasefire talks in Qatar, blaming Hamas and pledging to seek other ways to rescue Israeli hostages and make Gaza safe.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that he was sent to craft a plan to boost food and aid deliveries as part of an effort \"to save lives and end this crisis,\" while Mr. Trump wrote on social media that the fastest way to end the crisis would be for Hamas to surrender and release hostages.",
      "International organizations have said Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on food crises, said recent developments, including Israel's complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.\"",
      "Though the flow of aid has resumed, including via airdrops, the amount getting into Gaza remains far lower than what aid organizations say is needed. A security breakdown in the territory has made it nearly impossible to safely deliver food to starving Palestinians; much of the limited aid entering is hoarded and later sold at exorbitant prices.",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg, South Africa \u2014 African countries had been bracing for bad news and scrambling for last-minute negotiations ahead of President Trump's announcement of tariffs on Thursday night.",
      "South Africa, which has had a\u00a0strained relationship with Mr. Trump, is the only African country singled out in the announcement with a 30% tariff increase on Aug. 7. Most other African countries have been hit with tariffs of 10-15%.",
      "South African Trade Minister Parks Tau said he, other ministers, and people across all sectors, from business to civil society, had been working for months to negotiate a deal with Washington, including offering to invest $3.3 billion in U.S. industries and buy natural gas but there was no response.",
      "\"My opinion, we have pulled out all stops, sending ministers from various departments, business delegations and trade unions to fully address U.S. concerns,\" Tau said.",
      "He said there was no response to their initial offer until Wednesday evening, when U.S. officials told them to improve their offer in a last-minute appeal.",
      "\"We don't have a deal, we spoke to U.S. last night (Wednesday) and they indicated that they could not confirm what the announcement would be and encouraged us to submit an enhanced proposal that would be presented to the White House,\" Tau said.",
      "In a statement Thursday night, Tau said, \"We are working with urgency and resolve to implement real, practical interventions that defend jobs and position South Africa competitively in a shifting global landscape.\"",
      "In neighboring Lesotho, the government declared a state of emergency following the declaration in April that the U.S. would impose a 50% tariff \u2014 the highest in the world. The threat of tariffs had devastating effects reverberating across the tiny mountain kingdom of just over 2 million people. The notice came just months after U.S. aid funding cuts and now the threat of tariffs meant many garment companies closed their doors or reduced their staff to half-time in the ensuing months.",
      "Lesotho is often referred to as the \"denim capital of Africa\" as it is where Levi's and other brands are manufactured, as well as other textiles for companies like JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), created in 2000 as part of the \"trade not aid\" philosophy, gives some 35 African countries duty-free access to the U.S. for their goods. The textile industry, the country's main employer, providing as many as 50000 jobs, has had a trade surplus with the U.S. for the last few years. This is why some economists believe Mr. Trump singled out Lesotho for the hefty tariffs.",
      "Addressing Congress in March, Mr. Trump was listing off global cuts that he called wasteful expenditure and cited Lesotho as an African nation \"no one has ever heard of.\" His words reverberated across the country and started months of diplomacy that culminated in various concessions, including a willingness to accept deportees from the U.S., as well as other financial incentives likely helped revise the massive tariffs threatened downwards.",
      "Most African countries will have a 10-15% tariff imposed but remain concerned as the September deadline to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act approaches. Some analysts believe Mr. Trump will cancel it. Losing the free entry to the U.S. will mean all goods now exported under AGOA duty-free will be subjected to tariffs and will significantly impact these countries' economic growth. The new tariffs, combined with the loss of AGOA, could see increasing inflation and the depreciation of currencies in these countries, economists warn. It's a hit that many countries will struggle to absorb.",
      "Analysts are now looking toward the G20 in November in South Africa as a possibility to create new regional and global trade deals that do not include the U.S.",
      "\"I think we toss the U.S. out of the G20 for so many reasons and get tougher on Donald Trump to know collective will, that is the only response now,\" Patrick Bond, the distinguished professor and director of social change at the University of Johannesburg, told CBS News.",
      "Earlier this week, on board Air Force One, Mr. Trump told reporters that he might skip the G20 altogether, saying, \"I might send someone else because I have had a lot of problems with South Africa, they have very bad policies.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has falsely claimed the country has race-based laws, with the government seizing white farmers' land. As a result, Mr. Trump has offered refugee status to Afrikaans farmers, which several hundred have already accepted and are now living in the U.S. The U.S. government is also unhappy with South Africa's case of genocide at the International Criminal Court.",
      "With Thursday night's announcement of a 30% tariff for South Africa, it's clear the political tension between the countries now has economic consequences.",
      "South Africa's Reserve Bank Governor, Lesetja Kganyago, had warned in mid-July that a 30% tariff would mean a loss of 100,000 jobs. Economists warn that the country's agriculture and automotive industries will be the hardest hit.",
      "Bond warned South Africa could face a dire economic crisis if it doesn't shift quickly to diversify its export markets.",
      "\"We must diversify export markets and look at our own infrastructure projects and have massive subsidies for that,\" he said. \"None of the approaches in our toolbox are working, so we must move to new options and protect our industries.\"",
      "The South African government is concerned that the new tariffs will spark a lack of confidence in the market, bringing massive job losses and capital flight.",
      "President Cyril Ramaphosa speaking Friday to media at the swearing in of a new police minister avoided being pinned down on a response to the tariffs saying only: \"We deal with every government with the required respect and dignity and that is how we conduct our foreign policy and diplomatic matters and we expect that respect to be reciprocated\" before conceding that \"its too risky to be dependent on one country for trade.\"",

      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "Over the years, the U.S. has implemented heavy sanctions on Iranian industries, including trying to stop tankers used to transfer Iranian oil to China, which could help fund Iranian nuclear development programs. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions, which Washington called the most extensive action of its kind since 2018.",
      "Recently, a CBS News crew set off from Singapore, one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, to head more than 80 nautical miles away in international waters to see how the \"dark fleet\" operates.",
      "\"As long as there's a supply, there will be a demand for this discounted oil,\" said Charlie Brown, a former U.S. Navy officer who's now a senior adviser with United Against Nuclear Iran, who is advising the U.S. government.",
      "The supply is Iran, the demand is China, and this mutually beneficial relationship, which has long angered the United States, plays out off the coast of Malaysia in the Riau archipelago, an area the size of New York City.",
      "\"This is 'dark fleet' parking central,\" said Brown, who's been monitoring the \"dark fleet\" for years.",
      "He described one ship, the Tifani, as \"a well-known 'dark fleet' tanker that's always been out here on a regular basis.\"",
      "The tankers, full of oil, sail from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Malacca to the Riau archipelago. There, they transfer the crude to ships bound for China, which buys 90% of Iran's oil.",
      "During the CBS News crew's journey, four ship-to-ship transfers were happening in plain sight.",
      "These \"dark fleet\" tankers \u2014 all with their transponders switched off \u2014   clearly do not want to be identified.",
      "\"Both ships have a net or something, a tarp, deployed over the stern, covering the name and identification number \u2014   it's obvious deceptive practice,\" Brown said.",
      "Further analysis revealed one ship was the elusive Stellar Oracle, laden with Iranian oil. It was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in May.",
      "Close by, another ship-to-ship transfer was underway involving the Alps \u2014   not its real name \u2014   filled with Iranian crude that was also sanctioned in May. The receiving vessel Eon, which is not on any list, was caught in the act \u2014   a new sanctions violator.",
      "According to a congressional report last year, this trade generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, propping up the regime and its nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on this trade this year, but it's having little effect. China doesn't recognize the unilateral U.S. sanctions on Iran and says that its trade with Iran is legitimate.",
      "By the end of the day, 12 ship-to-ship transfers were recorded in the Riau archipelago \u2014   an unprecedented number and a clear indication Iran and China are only ramping up this illicit activity.",

      "Washington \u2014 U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee are heading to Gaza on Friday to survey food and aid distribution sites and meet with people living there, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Their visit is prompted by a dire humanitarian crisis, as children and adults in Gaza are struggling to survive off insufficient food and the death toll for people trying to get aid in Gaza mounts. President Trump said earlier this week that the U.S. and Israel will partner to run new food centers in the region, but he said Israel would preside over the centers to \"make sure the distribution is proper.\"",
      "Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee have been in Israel meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders about the situation in Gaza. Netanyahu has said, incorrectly, that there is \"no starvation\" in Gaza, despite emerging photos of emaciated children and repeated warnings from food security experts.",
      "\"President Trump is a humanitarian with a big heart,\" Leavitt said during Thursday's White House press briefing. \"And that's why he sent special envoy Witkoff to the region in an effort to save lives and end this crisis. Tomorrow, special envoy Witkoff and Ambassador Huckabee will be traveling into Gaza to inspect to the current distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food, and meet with local Gazans to hear firsthand about this dire situation on the ground. The special envoy and the ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "Leavitt said the administration will provide more details once the president approves a plan. She also said the meetings Witkoff and Huckabee have had with Netanyahu and other leaders have been productive.",
      "Mr. Trump earlier this week contradicted Netanyahu's assessment denying grave hunger in Gaza. The U.S. president said the children in Gaza \"look very hungry.\"",
      "\"There is real starvation in Gaza \u2014 you can't fake that,\" he told reporters.",
      "Also at issue is the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private food distribution organization that has faced\u00a0heavy criticism\u00a0for its food delivery methods and the number of people who have been\u00a0killed\u00a0trying to reach its distribution sites in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. and Israel have both supported the relatively new GHF to deliver aid in Gaza over the United Nations. A group of Democratic senators, led by Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, is urging the Trump administration to \"immediately cease all U.S. funding for GHF and resume support for the existing UN-led aid coordination mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches civilians in need,\" the senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "A senior U.S. official told CBS News on Wednesday that the U.S. has committed $30 million for aid in Gaza and those funds would be distributed \"in the next day or so.\"",
      "\"The United States of America supports GHF, but we would support any other mechanism that delivers food and the other needs of the Gazan people in a safe, secure fashion that does not get manipulated or distorted or taken advantage of by Hamas, the official said, adding, \"I'd like to think that some of the NGOs that are not succeeding right now would turn to GHF and say, let's work together for the sake of the Gazans in Gaza.\"",

Witkoff landed in Israel on Thursday, and the White House said he and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will visit Gaza\u00a0on Friday to inspect aid operations.",
      "Witkoff is expected to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and a possible ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told The Associated Press.",
      "This would be the first meeting between Witkoff and Netanyahu since both Israel and the U.S. called their negotiation teams home from Qatar one week ago. Witkoff said at the time that Hamas showed \"a lack of desire\" to reach a truce.",
      "Over the last 24 hours, at least 91 Palestinians were killed and more than 600 wounded while attempting to get aid in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. This includes 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said.",
      "That figure is expected to rise further, as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, smaller hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted.",
      "The Israeli military said Palestinians surrounded aid trucks and the Israeli military fired warning shots, but that it isn't aware of any injuries stemming from Israeli fire. A security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said the gunfire came from within the crowd and altercations between Palestinians attempting to access aid.",
      "The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducted 251 others. Fifty hostages are still in captivity in Gaza, including around 20 believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas government. Its count doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",
      "In Jerusalem, about 50 people, including families of some of the approximately 50 hostages still being held in Gaza, demonstrated on Thursday in front of Netanyahu's office calling for an end to the war.",
      "Israel says it will facilitate the entry of more aid into Gaza",
      "Under heavy international pressure, Israel announced a series of measures over the weekend to facilitate the entry of more international aid to Gaza, but aid workers say much more is needed.",
      "The Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid in Gaza said 270 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Wednesday, and 32 pallets of aid were airdropped into the Strip. That amount is far lower than the 500 to 600 trucks per day that aid organizations say are needed.",
      "The international community has heaped criticism on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. International organizations said that Gaza has been on the brink of famine for the past two years, but that recent developments, including a complete blockade on aid for 2 1/2 months, mean that the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza.\"",
      "The situation has led some leading Israeli rights groups to accuse Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,\" Yuli Novak, the director of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, said Monday.",
      "\"Systematic destruction of the health care system, denial of access to food, blocking of medial evacuations and using humanitarian aid to advance military targets all indicate a clear pattern of conduct, a pattern that reveals intent,\" Guy Shalev from the Israeli group Physicians for Human Rights said.",

The European Union and Arab League countries were among 17 nations that endorsed a seven-page document agreed to at a United Nations conference on a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "\"In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State,\" the declaration said, according to AFP.",

      "The department estimates that some 30,000 people from 70 countries remain in al-Hol Camp and one other similar camp, most of them wives and children of ISIS fighters as well as supporters of the extremist group. They include Iraqis as well as nationals of Western countries who traveled to join the U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group.",
      "Human rights groups for years have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the al-Hol camp, which the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have administered for years. The SDF are Washington's key ally in combating ISIS in Syria and its sleeper cells, and for years have run large swaths of northeastern Syria.",
      "CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams visited the al-Hol camp in 2019 and spoke with the camp's residents. Many of them expressed remorse for their prior ties to ISIS and said they wanted to return to their home countries \u2014 often in Western Europe \u2014 but some others defended the group's terror attacks.",
      "The State Department did not give any details about the repatriation, except to say in a statement that the child \"has known nothing of life outside of the camps\" and will be reunified with their family.",
      "The U.S. military for years has been pushing for countries to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol and the smaller, separate Roj Camp. Iraq has taken back an increasing number in recent years, but many other countries have remained reluctant.",
      "\"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in these displaced persons camps in northeast Syria is for countries of origin to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and where appropriate, ensure accountability for their nationals,\" the State Department statement read. \"The same goes for former ISIS fighters held in detention centers in northeast Syria,\" it said, using a different abbreviation for IS.",
      "Despite difficult talks to formally merge with the country's new rulers under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, Damascus and the SDF in May reached an agreement to repatriate Syrians in the camp. Since the ouster of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Washington has been pushing for the two sides to implement their deal and unify Syrian territory, which would ultimately put the camp under the control of the government.",

      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",
      "Rubio said de Moraes also \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech.\"",
      "\"The United States will use all appropriate and effective diplomatic, political, and legal instruments to protect the speech of Americans from foreign malign actors who would seek to undermine it,\" he said in a statement.",

In these extreme environments, the crushing pressure, scant food and lack of sunlight can make it hard to survive. Scientists know that tiny microbes prosper there, but less is known about evidence of larger marine life.",
      "Researchers traveling along the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean used a manned submersible to find tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at over 31,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean goes down to about 36,000 feet.",
      "Scientists had surveyed this area before and had hints that larger creatures might live at such depths. The new discovery confirms those suspicions and shows just how extensive the communities are, said Julie Huber, a deep sea microbiologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",

      "When Mr. Trump met with\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0at the White House in February, he said the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. India's leading supplier.",
      "Mr. Trump said Monday during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister\u00a0Keir Starmer\u00a0that the most countries that did not reach trade deals with the U.S. by his administration's deadline of Aug. 1 would face a 15% to 20% tariff. Last week, he had mentioned a broader range of 15% to 50%. The European Union reached a trade agreement with the U.S. over the weekend, and Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and U.K. also have trade deals with the U.S.",

It puts a lot of pressure on staying thin and staying young, and really it makes it hard to feel comfortable in one's own skin, because [of] the aging process.\"",

      "According to the FDA, 7-OH is beginning to be recognized for its potential to be abused because of its ability to bind to opioid receptors. Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products \"may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.\"",
      "\"I am in favor of this move because of the relationship of the 7-OH to the opioid receptors. This is essentially an opioid. It is semisynthetic and derived from the kratom plant whose leaves make a stimulant.

      "Other symptoms may include fever, brain fog, dizziness, palpitations and nerve pain, among others.",
      "Testing, treatment and prevention",
      "A blood test can help diagnose Lyme disease, but timing matters.",
      "\"The way we diagnose Lyme disease in the blood is by looking for antibodies, for the immune system's response to the infection, as opposed to other infectious testing, where you find the bacteria itself,\" Handel told Fox News Digital.",
      "TICK BITES AND LYME DISEASE: WHAT TO DO IF A TICK BITES YOU OR YOUR PET",

      "The legislation advances the pro-life movement\u2019s longtime goal of defunding Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, but a federal judge in Massachusetts has temporarily blocked the Trump Health and Human Services Department from carrying it out.",

      "\"Congress has the power of the purse,\" Muller said. \"Congress has a lot of discretion [over] how it wants to spend its money, and this is not an instance where the executive has been engaged in overreach or doubtful conduct. \u2026 This is ordinary legislation, and when it comes to ordinary legislation, there's more deference given to Congress, and certainly more in how it chooses to subsidize things, where it wants to give money or where it doesn't want to give money.\"",
      "The judge's decision to temporarily block the funding cuts stemmed from a lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit with hundreds of facilities across the country that provide abortions and other reproductive health services.",
      "Planned Parenthood's attorneys alleged in court papers that the provision was unconstitutional, arguing it would deprive the nonprofit of millions of dollars in Medicaid reimbursements, causing it to lose half of its patients and forcing it to shutter up to one-third of its facilities.",

      "Katie Daniel, counsel at SBA Pro-Life America, told Fox News Digital Planned Parenthood was making a \"desperate argument\" that \"totally undermines Congress' ability to determine how taxpayer dollars are spent.\" It also signals that Planned Parenthood was not a solvent business, she said.",
      "\"It's a business that really can't keep itself afloat without getting hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars,\" Daniel said.",
      "Planned Parenthood's attorneys noted that Medicaid does not typically cover abortions and that the funding cuts would affect other services. Cancer and sexually transmitted infections would go undetected, especially for low-income people, and more unplanned pregnancies would occur because of a lack of contraception access, the attorneys said.",
      "\"The adverse public health consequences of the Defund Provision will be grave,\" the attorneys wrote.",
      "Daniel said the Medicaid marketplace includes other options for clinics and that those options \"outnumber Planned Parenthood nationally 15 to one.\"",
      "Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee, said she was inclined to agree with Planned Parenthood that the legislation violated several provisions in the Constitution and granted a preliminary injunction, which the Department of Justice is now appealing.",
      "That lawsuit has been joined by two others challenging the bill. A coalition of 21 states with Democratic attorneys general, along with the District of Columbia and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, brought one of them on Monday.",
      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 health facilities in the Pine Tree State, has also sued over the legislation. While lawmakers have touted that the bill defunds Planned Parenthood, it was written to include other entities, including Maine Family Planning, as a way to pass parliamentarian scrutiny.",

      "Daniel told Fox News Digital she anticipates the higher courts will rule in favor of the Trump administration but that the bill's one-year limit on the funding cuts works in Planned Parenthood's favor.",
      "\"At this point for Planned Parenthood, it's really about running out the clock,\" Daniel said. \"The defund provision is for one year, so every single day that they can keep getting money. \u2026 That's existential to them.\"",
      "If the Trump administration ultimately wins the court fight, it could attempt to claw back the Medicaid funds it lost while Talwani's injunction was in place. Daniel noted, however, that \"it's incredibly difficult, it's time-consuming, it's costly, and Planned Parenthood is relying on all of that.\"",
      "Among Planned Parenthood's allegations was a longshot claim that Congress's bill violates the Constitution's bill of attainder clause because it singles out and punishes Planned Parenthood without a trial.",
      "Bills of attainder are pieces of legislation that serve to bypass the role of judges and punish people or entities. The Constitution prohibits bills of attainder because they infringe on the function of the courts.",

      "\"People have tried to argue that certain things that Congress does, singling out or targeting individuals, could rise to a bill of attainder,\" Muller said. \"This has gotten some traction in lower courts. It has never really gotten traction in the courts of appeal because it is far afield from the original meaning of the Constitution on this topic.\"",

      "You might already know that Facebook\u2019s biggest strength isn\u2019t the social media platform itself, but the user data it collects.",
      "The data we hand over without thinking twice is what this multibillion-dollar company uses to generate revenue. It sells that data to advertisers, who then try to make money off you by showing ads in the hope that you\u2019ll buy their products. I\u2019ll admit, sometimes the ad platform can be beneficial by connecting small businesses to potential buyers.",
      "However, since Facebook allows almost anyone to advertise with minimal moderation, it often leads to dangerous scams. Security researchers have found that a persistent malvertising campaign is plaguing Facebook, leveraging the reputations of well-known cryptocurrency exchanges to lure victims into a maze of malware.",

      "An iPhone with Facebook login screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",

      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you.

      "Dior has begun notifying U.S. customers of a data breach that exposed sensitive personal information after a cybersecurity incident earlier this year. In a notification letter, the French brand says the breach occurred Jan. 26, 2025, but wasn\u2019t discovered until more than three months later, on May 7.",
      "\"The House of Dior recently discovered that an unauthorized external party accessed some of the data we hold for our Dior Fashion and Accessories customers. We immediately took steps to contain this incident,\" the company told CyberGuy in a statement.",

      "The company, part of the LVMH luxury group, clarified that no payment or financial data was stored in the affected systems.",
      "\"No payment information, including bank account or payment card information, was contained in the database accessed,\" the company said, adding that law enforcement has been notified, and third-party cybersecurity experts were brought in to investigate.",

      "The incident mirrors a previously reported breach involving Dior customers in South Korea and China. At the time, Dior did not mention any impact in the U.S., but the timeline aligns. Moreover, its sibling brand Louis Vuitton, also owned by LVMH, recently disclosed similar breaches affecting customers in the U.K., Turkey and South Korea.",

      "Dior has not confirmed how many U.S. customers were affected or the full scale of the breach. However, BleepingComputer reports that the same attack targeted Dior and Louis Vuitton. Investigators have tentatively linked the breach to the ShinyHunters extortion group, which reportedly accessed the data through a compromised third-party vendor.",

      "One proactive step is to consider a personal data removal service.

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",

      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "Although ChatGPT agent breaks new ground, it does not always deliver instant results. When handling complex multi-step tasks like planning an entire itinerary or generating slide decks, the process can take minutes or even hours because it requires your confirmation before performing sensitive actions.",
      "Currently, slide deck creation remains in beta. While the outputs are organized and editable, they sometimes lack polish and may show formatting issues. The system does not yet support importing existing slideshow templates, but OpenAI plans to add this feature in future updates.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Now, imagine delegating your most tedious tasks, such as replying to emails, booking dinners, or researching vacations, to an assistant who truly acts on your behalf. ChatGPT agent equips ChatGPT with both intelligence and action; it goes beyond suggesting ideas by actually getting things done.",
      "You retain full control while avoiding the need to micromanage every click or keystroke. Whether your schedule fills quickly or you simply dislike digital grunt work, ChatGPT agent is built to manage these demands efficiently.",
      "Looking ahead, OpenAI intends for the agent to work even more independently, completing your to-do list as you focus on what matters most. The key question remains: how much will you be willing to hand off?",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand. However, the biggest challenge for OpenAI will be striking the right balance between convenience, safety, and privacy.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., discusses allegations big tech, government and corporate America are working together to steal consumers' information on 'Fox News Tonight.'",
      "In Greek mythology, the Sirens were creatures whose irresistible song lured sailors to their doom. Odysseus, the hero of\u00a0\"The Odyssey,\" wanted to hear that famous song. But he knew it was dangerous. So, he had his men tie him to the mast and block their ears with beeswax. Then, they sailed toward the Island of the Sirens. Why? Because Odysseus understood that once he heard their song, he wouldn't be able to resist. And that song always leads to trouble.",

      "A dad working on his laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles.

    "story": [
      "An aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows.",
      "Delta Air Lines, one of the country's largest carriers, is making headlines for its ambitious rollout of artificial intelligence-powered ticket pricing. Instead of fixed fares, Delta is using AI.",
      "The airline emphasizes that the system doesn't use personal data like your habits or booking history. Rather, it relies on aggregated market trends and analyst oversight to determine fares.",
      "By the end of this year, Delta aims to set 20% of ticket prices dynamically using AI, a sevenfold increase from just a year ago. This high-tech approach could result in better deals or higher costs, not because of who you are, but because of market demand at the time you book. Let's take a look at how it works, why Delta's betting on it and what it means for your wallet.",

      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: WARNING ON ELECTRICITY PRICES",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI-powered system replaces static pricing with a dynamic model that evaluates real-time market data, like demand surges or route-specific trends, to recommend pricing tiers.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants smarter, not personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues.",
      "However, the airline states it is not personalizing prices based on individual behavior. Instead, the AI analyzes large-scale patterns, like route demand, seasonal shifts, and timing trends, before analysts set final prices.",
      "Delta's strategy is simple \u2014 a price that's available on that flight, at that time, to you, the individual.",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",
      "Some privacy advocates worry this could disadvantage customers who lack the means or time to search for the best deals, potentially charging the highest prices to those unable to shop around.",
      "We reached out to Delta for a comment, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Delta says it does not tailor prices based on your digital footprint. You won't be charged more because you searched twice or booked from a certain device. Instead, prices respond to broader factors like how many seats are left, the time of day, and demand on that route.",
      "That said, airfares will likely feel even more unpredictable. Shopping around is now a must. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase.",
      "A VPN may still help you hide your location, but Delta states that its pricing does not vary by personal data like IP or browser history. Still, comparing prices across platforms and booking early remain smart moves.",
      "Privacy matters more than ever, not because Delta is watching you, but because digital tools are transforming how industries think about pricing. In short, you still have power as a consumer. Be smart, be flexible, and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'",
      "If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.",
      "PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.",

      "PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.",
      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.",

      "AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.",
      "Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.",
      "AI data center needing high energy demands\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.",
      "While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.",

      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.",

One crew declined and the pilots of the American Airlines flight from Wichita initially hesitated before agreeing, according to a transcript released this week, The Washington Post noted.

      "From Gaza to Greenland, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to be taking increasingly bolder diplomatic stabs at President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy even though such gestures don\u2019t \"carry weight\" as Trump pointed out last week after the French leader declared his intention to recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "\"French Presidents from Charles de Gaulle onwards have\u00a0reveled in the idea that they are a natural counterweight to U.S. foreign policy on the international stage,\" Alan Mendoza, executive director of the U.K.-based Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital Monday.",
      "Charles de Gaulle was\u00a0France\u2019s long-serving leader in the 1950s and 1960s and was famously resistant to U.S. global dominance, withdrawing his country from NATO\u2019s military command structure in a bid to increase its military independence and criticizing U.S. policies in Eastern Europe and Vietnam.",

      "Such contrarian actions, Mendoza said, \"have in many ways defined the French Fifth Republic, with\u00a0larger-than-life characters thrusting their views onto the world stage.",
      "\"The difference now is that France matters far less globally than it did 60 years ago,\" he said, adding that a weakening of the European country\u2019s economy and its military might \"means that where once de Gaulle could roar, now Macron whimpers.\"",
      "\"What was once a sign of French strength and confidence now therefore looks more like a desperate attempt to escape irrelevance,\" said Mendoza.",
      "In a dramatic announcement last week, Macron said that at the United Nations General Assembly in September France intends to declare its recognition of a Palestinian state, even as Palestinian terror groups continue to battle Israel in the Gaza Strip.",

      "\"Greenland is not to be sold, not to be taken,\" Macron declared in a\u00a0diplomatic stab at Trump\u2019s foreign policy and seemingly an attempt to rally support from\u00a0other European countries to stand up to the U.S.",

      "\"The American way\u00a0has been enormously appealing in Europe since World War\u00a0II, but it has come in part at the expense of the French, who have culturally lost a lot of ground to the Anglophones, especially the Americans,\" he said. \"Consequently, many Frenchmen have a love-hate relationship with the U.S.\"",

And they raise the question of how much more there might be before the midterms, despite Musk\u2019s messy post-White House breakup with Trump and his statements in July about starting a third party, made after the donations.",
      "Musk\u2019s June 27 donations supporting the Senate Leadership Fund and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the two GOP super PACs, came about a month after leaving his official post as an adviser to Trump and days before he began publicly discussing the idea of starting a new political party after the passage of Trump's big domestic spending bill.",
      "In between, he had feuded with Trump online, even attacking Trump for his past personal ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Meanwhile, other new campaign finance reports show Musk pumped $45.3 million into his own super PAC in the first six months of this year. The tech billionaire gave nearly $17.9 million directly to the group and sent another $27.4 million in in-kind contributions, with Musk covering funds for million-dollar prizes to voters who signed petitions.",
      "America PAC spent $47.3 million in the first six months of the year, including $15.5 million through the first week of April, when the group was heavily involved in the April 1 elections for the Wisconsin state Supreme Court and special House elections in Florida.",
      "The group reported spending $6 million on canvassing and field operations, as well as a few million dollars on digital ads, mailers and phone calls.",
      "The full scope of Musk\u2019s giving in the first half of 2025 isn\u2019t clear yet \u2014 super PACs will continue filing fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday ahead of a midnight filing deadline, and many other groups involved in politics never have to disclose their donors.",
      "Musk spent approximately a quarter-billion dollars in the 2024 election, given largely in support of Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "Thursday\u2019s America PAC filing covers fundraising and spending from Jan. 1 through June 30. It\u2019s unclear whether Musk used his super PAC for anything related to his July pledge to start a new political party, which came after the period covered by the new report.",
      "Musk spent about five months in the White House as an adviser to Trump and the public face of the president\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d initiative. But he\u2019s had a rocky relationship with Trump since the final days of his official tenure, repeatedly criticizing the White House\u2019s signature tax cut and spending bill."

      "SAN ANTONIO \u2014\u00a0Flaco Jimenez, a six-time Grammy winner who took his conjunto accordion musicianship to the national and worldwide stages with countless superstar musicians and bands, has died, his family announced. He was 86.",
      "The San Antonio music gem, whose first name is Leonardo but who was better known by his nickname, Flaco (which means Skinny), continued the music tradition handed down by his father and shared with his siblings. He built a legacy that honored the Texas-Mexican music tradition centered on the trills of his three-row accordion and gave it modern twists.",
      "\"It is with great sadness that we share tonight the loss of our father, Flaco Jimenez,\" his family said in a social media post Thursday. \"He was surrounded by his loved ones and will be missed immensely.\"",
      "Jimenez, a San Antonio native, was perhaps most popularly known as a member of the Texas Tornados, which gained fame with its hit song \"(Hey Baby) Que Pas\u00f3.\" The band also included Doug Sahm, Freddy Fender and Augie Meyers, also Texas musicians.",
      "But well before that success and after, he was making hits, breaking barriers and widening the interest in the sound of conjunto music beyond South Texas. Beyond the greats of the Texas Tornados, he collaborated with The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Dwight Yoakam, Carlos Santana, Los Lobos, Joe Ely, Willie Nelson and Linda Ronstadt, to name a few. He performed with various bands, from Leonardo Jim\u00e9nez y sus Caporales to Los Super Seven, and played alongside others such as Los Texmaniacs.",
      "He had learned from his father, Santiago Jimenez. Though he doesn't enjoy as much fame, his brother Santiago Jimenez Jr. also carries on the tradition.",
      "His decades of work were honored with multiple awards, including lifetime achievement awards from the Grammys, Billboard and the Tejano Music Awards.",
      "He was given the National Medal of Arts by President Joe Biden in 2022, but could not attend the ceremony because of illness.",
      "His 1992 \"Partners\" album, featuring him in several collaborations with other well-known music stars, was entered into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2021.",
      "\u201cPeople used to regard my music as cantina music, just no respect,\u201d he said in an interview with the Library of Congress at the time. \u201cThe accordion was considered something like a party joke ... I really give respect to everyone who helped me out on this record and I\u2019m flattered by this recognition.\u201d",
      "Hohner, the accordion brand he preferred, saluted his legacy in an Instagram post, calling him a \"global ambassador for Tex-Mex Conjunto music.\"",
      "In 2012, the nation recognized the cultural preservation achieved by his music as well as his trailblazing work with a National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, the nation\u2019s highest honor for folk and traditional arts.",
      "Jimenez remained close to his roots. He performed annually \u2014 though not this year because of illness \u2014 at the Tejano Conjunto Festival in San Antonio, held at a city park on the city's west side, where he grew up. The festival features up-and-coming and established Tejano and conjunto players, including several accordionists, and is a fundraiser for the local Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center. The center posted condolences on social media and noted his contributions to the center."

    "summary": "Trump's finalized list of tariffs imposes heavy levies on Switzerland, Laos, Syria,  Iraq, Serbia, Algeria and others.",
    "story": [
      "The penguins have been offered some relief. The people of Switzerland, Laos and Syria, not so much.",
      "This is the unlikely jumble of winners and losers of President Donald Trump\u2019s finalized list of tariffs, which governments, markets and businesses across the globe were scrambling to make sense of Friday.",
      "Some countries, such as Canada and South Africa, reacted with grave disappointment, warning that Trump\u2019s executive order could prompt job losses globally and rising costs for Americans. For others, the damage was not as bad as expected, with some able to thrash out deals before his deadline, and others hopeful of striking one in the future.",
      "The president had already drawn confusion and alarm when first unveiling his tariff list in April.",
      "Many analysts questioned, for example, why he was imposing a 10% levy on Heard and McDonald \u2014 two Antarctic outposts populated solely by penguins \u2014 or slapping a colossal 50% rate on the impoverished southern African nation of Lesotho.",
      "This week\u2019s finalized list elicited reprieve but also dismay\u2014 often with little or no explanation.",
      "The harshest import taxes were slapped on Syria (41%), Laos and Myanmar (40%), three relatively poor nations with, at best, modest trading relationships with Washington. And Iraq, Serbia (both 35%) and Algeria (30%) also found themselves subject to Trump\u2019s executive pen.",
      "(Brazil faces its own separate 50% tariff as punishment for what Trump says is a \"witch hunt\" against its former president and his right-wing ally, Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of plotting a coup.)",
      "Elsewhere Thursday, Lesotho\u2019s 50% rate was slashed to 15% \u2014 but not before huge damage was already wrought. The initial tariff saw American buyers pausing orders, thousands of people losing their jobs and the government declaring a state of disaster.",
      "Meanwhile the Heard and McDonald Islands and its flightless bird inhabitants dodged the tariff Trump threatened to impose on Australia, which owns the islands, and remained at the 10% rate first announced in April.",
      "It is \u201chard to tell if there is any logic\u201d to deciphering why some countries have been hit so hard while others were spared, said David Henig,  a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, a think tank based in Brussels.",
      "Without a detailed explanation from the White House, Henig told NBC News,  the calculations were most likely based on the previous formula Washington used that placed the biggest tariffs on the countries with the biggest trade surpluses.",
      "In announcing the tariffs Thursday, Trump said these surpluses \u201cconstitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\u201d (Many economists disagree that the U.S. trade deficit is inherently a bad thing, and his tariffs are the subject of an ongoing legal fight that is likely to end up at the Supreme Court.)",
      "While the international uproar over Lesotho meant it was given a reprieve, other nations may have seen their tariffs maintained or even increased because \u201cthey weren\u2019t the most obviously unfairly treated developing countries,\u201d Henig said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on its rationale.",
      "It\u2019s not only developing or obscure places feeling the heat of Trump\u2019s taxes.",
      "Switzerland \u2014 one of the richest nations in terms of gross domestic product per capita \u2014 awoke Friday to find that it had been slapped with a colossal 39% rate, which its government noted with \u201cgreat regret.\u201d",
      "This could spell trouble for Swiss chocolate and luxury watches, for which the U.S. is the largest market, with shares for Watches of Switzerland Group PLC tumbling 8.5% following the news Friday.",
      "India also caught the eye as an American ally hit with a large 25% tariff but dismissed any suggestion of a rift, with Goods Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal saying the world\u2019s most populous nation was \u201cconfident that the relationship will continue to move forward.\u201d",
      "In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, where exports to the U.S. have been increasing as manufacturers shift production from China, the reaction was generally relief.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia, which just agreed to a ceasefire after a five-day border conflict that killed more than 40 people, welcomed their 19% rate as \u201cwin-win\u201d and \u201cgreat news,\u201d while Malaysia described its own rate as a \u201cpositive outcome.\u201d Cambodia had been threatened with 49%.",
      "The consistency creates a level playing field for Southeast Asian governments \u2014 with Indonesia and the Philippines on the same rate, and 20% for Vietnam \u2014 after they had worried Trump\u2019s tariffs might favor some countries over others.",
      "Taiwan, a tech hub that has a large trade surplus with the U.S., was hit with a 20% rate, lower than the 32% threatened in April but higher than the 15% negotiated by Japan, South Korea and the European Union. President Lai Ching-te said Friday that the 20% rate was \u201ctemporary\u201d and that his government expected to negotiate a lower number.",
      "Still up in the air are the final tariff rates between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, who rattled global markets this spring as they imposed spiraling tit-for-tat levies before both sides agreed to put most on pause until Aug. 12.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said after meeting with Chinese trade officials this week that a potential extension of that pause could not be confirmed until Trump signed off on it.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s position on tariffs is consistent and clear,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a daily press briefing Friday. \u201cThere are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars.\u201d",

      "The unemployment rate in July was unchanged at 4.2%, but more people left the labor force, according to the report. Payrolls have now averaged just 35,000 over the last three months \u2014 the weakest pace of job growth since the onset of the pandemic in 2020.",
      "Jobs reports always contain revisions to previous months\u2019 reports, with sizable revisions rare but not entirely uncommon. Last August, under the Biden administration, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said 818,000 fewer jobs had been created over a 12-month period than initially thought.",

    "story": [
      "More fans than have ever watched a Major League Baseball game are set to show up Saturday to a field that didn\u2019t exist 32 days ago, in a state that has never previously hosted an MLB game.",
      "The baseball itself will be the only thing familiar about Saturday\u2019s matchup at Tennessee\u2019s Bristol Motor Speedway between the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds \u2014 and that is on purpose.",
      "MLB has staged games in unconventional places for the past decade. Yet while a 2016 game at North Carolina\u2019s Fort Bragg, games in 2021 and 2022 at the same Iowa cornfield made famous by the movie \u201cField of Dreams\u201d and last year\u2019s Negro Leagues tribute at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, were held in intimate settings, MLB\u2019s visit to a venue better known for motorsports was designed as a spectacle of sheer size.",
      "More than 85,000 tickets have been sold for a matchup dubbed the \u201cSpeedway Classic,\u201d a number that will break the league\u2019s attendance record of 84,587 set in 1954 when the New York Yankees visited Cleveland.",
      "\u201cThis one really ranks up there big just because of the enormity of what we\u2019re building,\u201d Murray Cook, the president of Brightview Sports, who consults MLB on fields and ballparks, told \"TODAY.\"",
      "That construction project began June 4, when the speedway started demolishing parts of its infield, including half of a building, in order to situate a baseball field between the half-mile track\u2019s third and fourth turns. Once that phase ended, it left a window of about 32 days to build the field and everything surrounding it.",
      "More than 18,000 tons of gravel were brought in to create a level playing field, topped by a shock-absorbing pad that rests underneath the 124,000 square feet of artificial turf playing surface. The turf was infilled with sand to provide a better bounce for a batted ball. More than 300 tons of clay were required to build the basepaths and mounds. Bristol Motor Speedway\u2019s existing lighting did not meet MLB standards for broadcasts, which required the temporary installation of 415 extra lighting fixtures, as well.",
      "\u201cBatting tunnels, dugouts, backstop net, batter\u2019s eye, bullpens, foul poles; none of this is here, right?\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo all that has to be brought in.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s game will mark the first MLB game in Tennessee for the same reason last season\u2019s game in Birmingham was its first in Alabama, and why MLB has staged other games in recent years in Korea and Olympic Stadium in London. Planting live games in markets that otherwise would not have big-league baseball is \u201ca huge pillar in terms of our growth strategy,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in April when visiting Nashville.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the commissioner\u2019s office plan to grow the game around the world and to take it to places where, you know, you don\u2019t have a major league team,\u201d Cook said.",
      "When MLB visited London for series in 2023 and 2024, where a field was placed atop the home pitch of West Ham of the Premier League, attendance topped out just shy of 60,000. Bristol provided a much bigger logistical challenge.",
      "Bristol Motor Speedway is the country\u2019s second-largest venue in the U.S. as judged by permanent seating, said Jerry Caldwell, the Bristol Motor Speedway president, and the venue has used that capacity before to host record-smashing attendance figures. A 2016 college football game between Tennessee and Virginia Tech set the NCAA\u2019s single-game record.",
      "MLB\u2019s challenge involved creating a baseball venue within a NASCAR facility that is approximately twice the size of a football field. The construction involved limitations. Though a four-sided videoboard called the \u201cColossus\u201d hangs 180 feet over the speedway\u2019s infield, strung up via cables that stretch to the stadium\u2019s corners, the ballpark design sought to keep it out of play as much as possible. During the game, it will be in foul territory, and netting was installed to keep foul balls from damaging the screen.",
      "\u201cI love seeing this baseball field rise up out of the middle of the racetrack and kind of be born, almost,\u201d Caldwell said.",
      "Caldwell said he hopes the memories of the game endure. But the venue\u2019s transformation will be brief. Cook expects the tear-down following the game to last about 15 days. Once removed, the entire field will be donated to Eastern Tennessee State University.",
      "\u201cWe want it to be something that they\u2019ll always remember, they\u2019ll talk about, have fond memories of creating wonderful memories with their family, and I know that\u2019s what will happen,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll remove all this, and six weeks later, we\u2019ll do the same thing for the playoffs in NASCAR.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee were visiting an aid distribution site in Gaza Friday.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, made an extremely rare visit to Gaza on Friday amid the spiraling hunger crisis in the enclave under Israel's deadly offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "The pair visited an aid distribution site in Rafah run by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has for months overseen the majority of aid distribution in the enclave under a new system launched in May.",
      "\"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza,\" Witkoff said in a post on X. He said they spent that time \"level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions,\" and meeting with GHF and other agencies.",
      "\"The purpose of the visit was to give @POTUS a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza,\" he said.",
      "Huckabee said in a separate post that he had joined Witkoff on the visit to \"learn the truth\" about aid sites run by GHF. He said they also received briefings from the Israeli military and \"spoke to folks on the ground.\" It was not immediately clear whom he was referring to.",
      "In a post on X sharing images of the delegation in Gaza, he hailed the number of meals distributed by GHF \u2014 \"more than one million meals a day\" as an \"incredible feat.\"",
      "GHF has been predominantly responsible for the distribution of aid in Gaza since late May, when Israel said it would allow a basic amount of humanitarian supplies into the enclave after lifting a crippling blockade that barred the entry of food and other vital items for more than two months.",
      "Israel on Sunday announced measures to allow more aid into Gaza amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths from starvation. Since then, GHF has continued to distribute about 1.2 million meals a day, according to data shared by the organization. In a population of roughly 2.1 million people, that equates to just over half a meal per person per day on average.",
      "Humanitarian groups have said the aid that has so far been allowed into Gaza over the past week is not enough to stave off famine in the enclave.",
      "They have also condemned incidents in which hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach aid in the weeks since the new distribution system came into effect.",
      "Since late May, more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food, with 859 deaths \"in the vicinity\" of GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys,\" the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, said in a news release Thursday. It said most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.",
      "Witkoff and Huckabee made the trip as part of an effort by Washington to secure a plan to see more food delivered to Gaza as deaths from starvation in the enclave continue to rise, according to the White House.",
      "It was not clear how arrangements for the visit, including the meetings with local Palestinians in Gaza, were being arranged, with Israel having maintained strict control over access to Gaza throughout the war, barring international media and foreign officials from entering the territory independently.",
      "Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, condemned the visit, writing in a statement addressed to Witkoff: \"Gaza is not Animal Farm that needs a theatrical personal visit to take some pictures in front of the #Death_Factories that your American companies manage in collaboration with the fascist army of Israel.\"",
      "The trip comes as a growing number of Palestinians continue to die from starvation despite months of warnings from humanitarian groups about the impact of Israel\u2019s offensive and the strict aid restrictions it has upheld.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee would brief Trump \"immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "She said more details would be forthcoming once the plan was \"approved and agreed on by the president of the United States.\"",
      "Their visit to Gaza comes after Witkoff traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday to address the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Trump said earlier this week that \"real starvation\" was taking place, citing images he had seen on TV in a break with Netanyahu, who has denied there is starvation in the enclave and sought to blame Hamas for the crisis."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/what-to-buy-tariff-price-increases-rcna221683",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 14:37:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Brands are already raising prices, so experts recommend buying tech, household basics, clothing and baby gear before costs go up even more.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don\u2019t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1.",
      "Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there\u2019s still time to save \u2014 tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year.",
      "Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "What to buy as tariff-related price hikes roll out",
      "We don\u2019t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn\u2019t mean you should panic buy \u2014 it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you\u2019ve been saving up for. It\u2019s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.",
      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",
      "Basics and groceries",
      "Tide Pods Liquid Laundry Detergent (76-Count)",
      "During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble\u2019s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",
      "Kosterina Original Extra Virgin Olive Oil",
      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",
      "Technology",
      "Apple AirPods 4 with ANC",
      "Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple\u2019s AirPods 4 for two months, says they\u2019re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. \u201cThese are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.\u201d",
      "JBL Clip 5",
      "The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team\u2019s go-to Bluetooth speaker \u2014 the audio quality is impressive for the device\u2019s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant.",
      "Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con",
      "While Nintendo didn\u2019t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said \u201cother adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.\u201d",
      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It\u2019s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games.",
      "Google Pixel Watch 3",
      "Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it\u2019s Google\u2019s best smartwatch yet, although it\u2019s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep.",
      "Clothes and shoes",
      "Gap Organic Cotton VintageSoft T-Shirt",
      "I buy basics from Gap every time they\u2019re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it.",
      "501\u00ae Original Fit Men's Jeans",
      "These Levi\u2019s jeans, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a pair of Levi\u2019s 501\u2019s for over 6 years now,\u201d says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. \u201cI love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There\u2019s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.\u201d",
      "Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings",
      "Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cstrategic.\u201d The brand didn\u2019t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon\u2019s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord.",
      "Adidas Samba OG Sneaker",
      "Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas\u2019 most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole.",
      "Birkenstock Arizona",
      "Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand\u2019s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There\u2019s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand.",
      "Under Armour Charged Surge 4 Sneaker",
      "During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it\u2019s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We\u2019ve tested lots of Under Armour\u2019s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, is a basic shoe that\u2019s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool.",
      "Home and kitchen",
      "Ninja AF101 Air Fryer",
      "SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company\u2019s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja\u2019s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it\u2019s big enough to feed a few people,  yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand.",
      "Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum",
      "We recommend Dyson\u2019s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy \u2014 Dyson\u2019s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool.",
      "Sproos! Handheld Showerhead with Filter Set",
      "In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven\u2019t seen yet \u2014 that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand\u2019s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions.",
      "Ikea Kallax Shelf Unit",
      "Ikea\u2019s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they\u2019re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz\u2019s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. \u201cThis storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City \u2014 it\u2019s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.\u201d",
      "Casper Original Hybrid Mattress",
      "Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas \u2014 that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers.",
      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",
      "Will retailers raise prices due to tariffs?",
      "Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now:",
      "Walmart: Walmart started rolling out price hikes this summer, although the retailer didn\u2019t share details about what types of products will be impacted or what the rollout will look like.Target: Target has recently reported lower earnings and ended its price matching policy, signs that it will likely raise prices due to tariffs in the future.

      "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. If a company brings foreign goods into the U.S., it must pay the U.S. government a percentage of those goods.",
      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China and Mexico are also in ongoing talks with the U.S. about tariffs \u2014 China's pause on duties expires on Aug. 12 and Mexico's pause expires at the end of October.",

      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",
      "Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now.",

      "Midway through the film, Anna makes a decision that temporarily halts her relationship with Jamie. While she has a job lined up at Goldman Sachs once her year at Oxford finishes, she tells Jamie she wants to give it up so she can stay with him. Jamie thinks she is making a mistake by throwing away her future, and the pair separates.",
      "However, the duo reconciles when Anna convinces Jamie that her only future is with him. The next morning, Anna wakes up to find Jamie lying unconscious in bed. They rush to the hospital, and Jamie learns he has a severe case of pneumonia. In Jamie\u2019s hospital room, they discuss a big trip to visit all the European sights that Jamie wants Anna to see.",
      "During the film\u2019s final sequences, Anna and Jamie travel Europe, visiting cities like Paris, Venice and Amsterdam. It seems like Jamie has recovered \u2014 but it turns out these memories only belong to Anna. Jamie has already died, and she is on the adventure alone, imagining what it would be like if Jamie were with her.",
      "Carson says that this heartbreaking moment in the film is captured by one of the movie's many literary references.",
      "\u201cI always go back to one of the authors that we quote often. Alfred Tennyson once said, \u2018It\u2019s better to have loved than lost than never to have loved at all,\u201d Carson says. \u201cThat is such a timeless and profound truth that I think we\u2019re reminded of in this story.\u201d",
      "Carson added that dealing with the film\u2019s profound subject matter was a \u201cbeautiful challenge.\u201d One of her favorite parts of the film was how they handled its tragic ending with comedy.",
      "\u201cIt was so important that comedy was the thing that always grounded our film. I think in times of darkness and loss, comedy is often how we cope,\u201d Carson says. \u201cComedy is what makes even the deepest moments just hit even harder.\u201d",
      "Another literary reference that stuck with Carson was the Emily Dickinson she set as Anna\u2019s lock screen: \u201cForever is composed of now.\u201d",
      "\u201cLife exists in the messiness, in the moments, in the now. All we have is a succession of moments,\u201d Carson says. \u201cI love \u2018forever is composed of now.\u2019 I always go back to that.\u201d"

      "Jason Momoa has got a whole new look \u2014 and he's not the biggest fan of it.",
      "In a joint Instagram video post with his company Mananalu Water, Momoa could be seen carefully shaving off his beard with a razor while he stood outside.",
      "\u201cGoddammit, I hate it,\u201d he said, looking at the finished result.",
      "The \u201cAquaman\u201d star revealed he was shaving off his beard for the first time in six years as part of the preparation for his upcoming return to the \u201cDune\u201d franchise.",
      "\u201cThis is the kickoff, 'Dune 3,'\" he said, before referencing \"Dune\" director Denis Villeneuve by saying, \u201cOnly for you, Denis.\"",
      "During an March 31 appearance on TODAY, Momoa revealed he would reprise his role as the clean-shaven Duncan Idaho, a swordmaster of House Atreides and mentor to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s Paul Atreides, in \u201cDune: Part Three.\u201d Momoa's character was killed off in 2021's \"Dune,\" and did not return in the 2024 sequel.",
      "Speaking to TODAY's Craig Melvin, Momoa confirmed he would be \u201cmaking a comeback.\u201d",
      "When asked if he would return in the same way as depicted in Frank Herbert\u2019s six-part \u201cDune\u201d book series, which shows Duncan Idaho resurrected in the form of a clone, Momoa did not offer much insight.",
      "\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to get in trouble or not, but it\u2019s the same thing like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019, you know what I mean?\u201d Momoa said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t read the books, it\u2019s not my fault, right? Yeah, there\u2019s going to be \u2026 I\u2019m going to be coming back.\u201d",
      "While \u201cDune\u201d fans will have to wait until Dec. 2026 to see Momoa's official return to the franchise, they did not hold back their thoughts on his new clean-shaven look in the comment section of his post.",
      "\"Am I the only one who likes 'no beard' ?? \ud83d\ude02,\" one person wrote.",
      "Another said, \u201cGreat you look so handsome omg Jason why do you hide your beautiful face \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.\u201d",
      "Some fans begged to differ, with one sharing three simple words about his beardless look: \u201cPut it back \ud83d\ude02.\u201d",
      "One fan, who noted his upcoming film, wrote,  \"\ud83d\ude2e\u2764\ufe0f Dune 3 is coming! You look handsome either way, I am a huge fan of the beard however! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
      "And another weighed in, writing, \"I like you better with a beard, you look more mature and serious. But work is work. And if you have to shave for the shoot, that\u2019s okay too. Without a beard, you look young and daring.\"",
      "The last time Momoa was seen shaving off his beard was in 2019 when he did a YouTube video to try and get people to \"switch to INFINITELY RECYCLABLE aluminum.\"",
      "\"Let\u2019s make a positive change for the health of our planet. Let\u2019s clean up our oceans and our land. Join me on this journey. Let\u2019s make a switch to INFINITELY RECYCLABLE aluminum. Water in cans, NOT plastic,\" he said."

      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \u201cThe Hunting Wives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is the definition of a binge watch. Sultry yet thought-provoking, the series has stayed near the top of the Netflix Top 10 charts since its debut on the streamer on July 21.",
      "Brittany Snow plays Sophie, who arrives in East Texas from Boston along with her husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit) and their son. She's a fish out of water, adjusting to new cultural norms and a few traumatic events in her past that cast a long shadow.",
      "The Maple Brook neighborhood clearly has a charged history. Luckily for Sophie, Margo (Malin Akerman) takes her under her wing \u2014 a good friend to have, considering Margo is married to a wealthy oil tycoon named Jed (Dermot Mulroney) who is running for governor.",
      "But there's a darkness lurking in this friend group. Local teenage Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, and anyone could be the killer. Signs are pointing to it being Sophie, since Abby was shot with Sophie\u2019s new gun. Yep, that\u2019s right: It only took a few weeks and Sophie was already getting arms to match her new neighbors\u2019.",
      "Sophie can hardly remember the night of Abby's murder \u2014 she and Margo were having a bit of a rager at Margo's lake house. But she's sure she's innocent. Still, she's not innocent when it comes to letting Margo convince her to start drinking, start driving after a tragic accident, and have affairs with younger men (and each other).",
      "Read on to find out what happens in \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d and how the ending compares to the book by May Cobb.",
      "Who Kills Abby on 'The Hunting Wives'?",
      "Do you really want to know? OK: It's Margo, Sophie's new lover and the queen bee of the friend group.",
      "Two scenes from the first episode foreshadow Margo's crime.",
      "First, Abby hooks up with her then-boyfriend, high schooler Brad (George Ferrier), but stops because it conflicts with her faith. In the middle of all this, Margo opens the door and makes eye contact with Brad. Yep, they\u2019re a secret item.",
      "Aside from the age gap, and aside from the fact that Margo is married, there's another complication. Brad's mom Jill (Katie Lowes) is married to a prominent pastor and is Margo's friend.",
      "Second, there's the question of the tampons.",
      "Sophie meets Margo for the first time in the bathroom of her palatial house. There, Margo lets it slip that she can't use tampons. But that's not quite the case. In the finale, when Sophie and Margo have rekindled their romance, Sophie goes to the bathroom and sees tampons. Margo says she can use tampons.",
      "Why would this matter? Well, Pastor Pete (Paul Teal), the town's youth pastor (more on that dude later), had told Sophie that Abby had gotten an abortion \u2014 but he interpreted Brad's confession wrong. In fact, it was Margo who had the abortion. When's a time that women can't use tampons? After abortions.",
      "Margo had gone to her estranged biological dad, a doctor, to perform the procedure. (At the same time as all this, Margo is campaigning for her husband's anti-abortion stance).",
      "As for why Margo killed Abby? Her motive was simple. After a lifetime of manipulating her way to the top, Margo couldn't let her status be threatened, and Abby was about to do just that.",
      "Abby figured out that Margo had the abortion and was planning to reveal it \u2014 a disaster for Margo, her husband's campaign and her political career.",
      "Margo kills her. With the help of her father and brother Kyle (Michael Aaron Milligan), they conspire to help Margo cover it up, creating an alibi for her.",
      "Who Else Dies in  'The Hunting Wives'?",
      "A lot of people! Four, in fact. Here\u2019s who dies in \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d aside from Abby.",
      "Abby's mom, Starr (Chrissy Metz), is killed by Jill, Brad's mom. Mess! Starr learns from Pastor Pete that her daughter had an abortion, which she didn't. She goes to confront Brad's mom, Jill \u2014 convinced that Jill had killed Abby. Seeing Starr with a rifle, Jill shoots her.Jill is then killed by Callie. Margo and Callie (Jaime Ray Newman), the sheriff's wife, go to Jill's house to confront her and find Starr's body. They're preparing to call the police. Jill pulls a gun out to stop them, then Callie kills her. Jill is framed as Abby's killer \u2014 until Sophie figures out the truth.Kyle is killed by Sophie in the show's final moments.

He kicks her out of their home and Margo goes to her brother Kyle's house. Kyle then goes after Sophie and tries to run her off the road. He gets out of his car to get her to talk. Sophie, instead, runs him over. She disposes of the body. This is her second vehicular homicide. Sophie had killed someone accidentally while drinking and driving in Massachusetts and her husband helped get her out of any legal troubles. Pastor Pete takes his own life. Officer Salazar (Karen Rodriguez) figures out that Pastor Pete had been kidnapping local girls \u2014 including, most recently, Abby's friend Nina (Abigail Rhyne). When he's cornered, he shoots himself. The police discover Nina and another missing girl in the back of his U-Haul.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, made an extremely rare visit to Gaza on Friday amid the spiraling hunger crisis in the enclave under Israel's deadly offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "The pair visited an aid distribution site in Rafah run by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has for months overseen the majority of aid distribution in the enclave under a new system launched in May.",
      "\"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza,\" Witkoff said in a post on X. He said they spent that time \"level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions,\" and meeting with GHF and other agencies.",
      "\"The purpose of the visit was to give @POTUS a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza,\" he said.",
      "Huckabee said in a separate post that he had joined Witkoff on the visit to \"learn the truth\" about aid sites run by GHF. He said they also received briefings from the Israeli military and \"spoke to folks on the ground.\" It was not immediately clear whom he was referring to.",
      "In a post on X sharing images of the delegation in Gaza, he hailed the number of meals distributed by GHF \u2014 \"more than one million meals a day\" as an \"incredible feat.\"",
      "GHF has been predominantly responsible for the distribution of aid in Gaza since late May, when Israel said it would allow a basic amount of humanitarian supplies into the enclave after lifting a crippling blockade that barred the entry of food and other vital items for more than two months.",
      "Israel on Sunday announced measures to allow more aid into Gaza amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths from starvation. Since then, GHF has continued to distribute about 1.2 million meals a day, according to data shared by the organization. In a population of roughly 2.1 million people, that equates to just over half a meal per person per day on average.",
      "Humanitarian groups have said the aid that has so far been allowed into Gaza over the past week is not enough to stave off famine in the enclave.",
      "They have also condemned incidents in which hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach aid in the weeks since the new distribution system came into effect.",
      "Since late May, more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food, with 859 deaths \"in the vicinity\" of GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys,\" the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, said in a news release Thursday. It said most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.",
      "Witkoff and Huckabee made the trip as part of an effort by Washington to secure a plan to see more food delivered to Gaza as deaths from starvation in the enclave continue to rise, according to the White House.",
      "It was not clear how arrangements for the visit, including the meetings with local Palestinians in Gaza, were being arranged, with Israel having maintained strict control over access to Gaza throughout the war, barring international media and foreign officials from entering the territory independently.",
      "Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, condemned the visit, writing in a statement addressed to Witkoff: \"Gaza is not Animal Farm that needs a theatrical personal visit to take some pictures in front of the #Death_Factories that your American companies manage in collaboration with the fascist army of Israel.\"",
      "The trip comes as a growing number of Palestinians continue to die from starvation despite months of warnings from humanitarian groups about the impact of Israel\u2019s offensive and the strict aid restrictions it has upheld.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee would brief Trump \"immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "She said more details would be forthcoming once the plan was \"approved and agreed on by the president of the United States.\"",
      "Their visit to Gaza comes after Witkoff traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday to address the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Trump said earlier this week that \"real starvation\" was taking place, citing images he had seen on TV in a break with Netanyahu, who has denied there is starvation in the enclave and sought to blame Hamas for the crisis."

Netanyahu said Monday that his government would work with international agencies, as well as with the U.S. and European nations, to ensure large amounts of aid enter the Gaza Strip.",

      "The president also said this week that the U.S., alongside international partners, would help fund and set up food centers in Gaza.",
      "Many Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have also voiced concern about the situation and are pushing the Trump administration to help broker a ceasefire agreement. Witkoff pulled the U.S. negotiating team out of Doha, Qatar, last week after he said Hamas showed \u201ca lack of desire\u201d to reach a deal.",
      "More than 120 people in Gaza have died from malnutrition since the start of the war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification said in recent days that \u201cthe worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip.\u201d",
      "A growing number of countries are increasingly condemning the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and the United Kingdom, France and Canada said they plan to recognize a Palestinian state this fall. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s office said it would recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel \u201ctakes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza.\u201d",

      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",
      "Things moved quickly after the takeover by the Tata Group, which consolidated several airlines it controlled, including Vistara and Air Asia India, into two entities: the full-cost carrier Air India and its budget arm, Air India Express.",
      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

      "Elsewhere Thursday, Lesotho\u2019s 50% rate was slashed to 15% \u2014 but not before huge damage was already wrought. The initial tariff saw American buyers pausing orders, thousands of people losing their jobs and the government declaring a state of disaster.",
      "Meanwhile the Heard and McDonald Islands and its flightless bird inhabitants dodged the tariff Trump threatened to impose on Australia, which owns the islands, and remained at the 10% rate first announced in April.",
      "It is \u201chard to tell if there is any logic\u201d to deciphering why some countries have been hit so hard while others were spared, said David Henig,  a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, a think tank based in Brussels.",
      "Without a detailed explanation from the White House, Henig told NBC News,  the calculations were most likely based on the previous formula Washington used that placed the biggest tariffs on the countries with the biggest trade surpluses.",
      "In announcing the tariffs Thursday, Trump said these surpluses \u201cconstitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\u201d (Many economists disagree that the U.S. trade deficit is inherently a bad thing, and his tariffs are the subject of an ongoing legal fight that is likely to end up at the Supreme Court.)",
      "While the international uproar over Lesotho meant it was given a reprieve, other nations may have seen their tariffs maintained or even increased because \u201cthey weren\u2019t the most obviously unfairly treated developing countries,\u201d Henig said.",

      "This could spell trouble for Swiss chocolate and luxury watches, for which the U.S. is the largest market, with shares for Watches of Switzerland Group PLC tumbling 8.5% following the news Friday.",
      "India also caught the eye as an American ally hit with a large 25% tariff but dismissed any suggestion of a rift, with Goods Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal saying the world\u2019s most populous nation was \u201cconfident that the relationship will continue to move forward.\u201d",
      "In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, where exports to the U.S. have been increasing as manufacturers shift production from China, the reaction was generally relief.",
      "Thailand and Cambodia, which just agreed to a ceasefire after a five-day border conflict that killed more than 40 people, welcomed their 19% rate as \u201cwin-win\u201d and \u201cgreat news,\u201d while Malaysia described its own rate as a \u201cpositive outcome.\u201d Cambodia had been threatened with 49%.",
      "The consistency creates a level playing field for Southeast Asian governments \u2014 with Indonesia and the Philippines on the same rate, and 20% for Vietnam \u2014 after they had worried Trump\u2019s tariffs might favor some countries over others.",
      "Taiwan, a tech hub that has a large trade surplus with the U.S., was hit with a 20% rate, lower than the 32% threatened in April but higher than the 15% negotiated by Japan, South Korea and the European Union. President Lai Ching-te said Friday that the 20% rate was \u201ctemporary\u201d and that his government expected to negotiate a lower number.",
      "Still up in the air are the final tariff rates between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, who rattled global markets this spring as they imposed spiraling tit-for-tat levies before both sides agreed to put most on pause until Aug. 12.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said after meeting with Chinese trade officials this week that a potential extension of that pause could not be confirmed until Trump signed off on it.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s position on tariffs is consistent and clear,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a daily press briefing Friday. \u201cThere are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars.\u201d",

      "Russia claimed Thursday to have captured a key Ukrainian town after more than 16 months of intense fighting and unleashed a deadly seven-hour drone assault on Kyiv that offered no hint of its agreeing to President Donald Trump's demands to end its war.",
      "A Ukrainian military spokesman denied Moscow's claims that it had captured Chasiv Yar, saying Russian troops had only raised their flag over an already occupied part of the strategically important town.",
      "Showing no appetite for the ceasefire Trump has increasingly demanded, Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov hailed the \"courage of the paratroopers\" of the 98th Guards Airborne Division, which Moscow says carried out the seizure.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump \u2014 whose historical warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin has chilled significantly in recent weeks \u2014 said he would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Moscow if it did not agree to a peace plan in 10 days.",
      "While Russia was declaring victory in Chasiv Yar, it was launching hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukrainian civilians in Kyiv.

      "But Sergey Markov, a former adviser to Putin who is now a pro-Kremlin commentator, said the town had \"no strategic significance\" and instead illustrated \"how this war can go on for many more years.\"",

      "One of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck Wednesday in Russia\u2019s Far East, triggering tsunami waves in Japan and Hawaii and prompting warnings and evacuations across the Pacific.",
      "Hawaii has so far \u201cnot seen a wave of consequence, which is a great relief to us,\u201d Gov. Josh Green said Tuesday after the first waves reached his state around 7:30 p.m. local time (1:30 a.m. Wednesday ET). But he said it was too early to say whether the danger had fully passed.",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later downgraded the tsunami warning for Hawaii to an advisory, as waves began to reach California and Washington state.",
      "Earlier, the 8.8-magnitude quake off Russia\u2019s Kamchatka Peninsula sent a tsunami wave into the country\u2019s Kuril Islands in the Pacific, where the governor said residents were safe.",
      "In Japan, officials said waves as high as 4.2 feet hit the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. No deaths or major damage have been reported so far.",
      "Pending any downward revision to the magnitude, the quake on Wednesday is tied for the sixth-largest ever recorded, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and is the world\u2019s largest since the 2011 earthquake off Japan that set off the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear meltdown.",
      "In Hawaii, people were told to leave low-lying coastal areas.",
      "\u201cOur appeal to you is: If you\u2019re in a low-lying area, get yourself safe, get to higher ground,\u201d Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said at a news conference.",
      "He said traffic was heavy on the island and urged patience, but also caution. \u201cPay attention. This is real, and it's most serious,\u201d he said.",
      "The state Department of Transportation warned people to avoid the town of Hanalei on the island of Kauai to allow people to evacuate.",
      "On the Big Island, Hilo Airport ceased commercial operations to facilitate evacuations from Keaukaha, the department said. The Coast Guard ordered all commercial vessels to leave harbors.",
      "The Tsunami Warning Center said waves of 1 to 3 yards above tide level were possible along some coastal areas of Hawaii, Chile, Japan and the Solomon Islands. Waves of more than 3 yards were possible along some coastal areas of Russia and Ecuador.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba asked those in affected areas to remain evacuated at safe locations until warnings were lifted.",
      "\u201cBecause there is still the possibility that larger tsunamis may arrive in second or third waves, the tsunami warnings remain in effect,\u201d he said.",
      "In Russia, the first tsunami wave hit the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk, the main settlement on Russia\u2019s Kuril Islands. Local governor Valery Limarenko said residents were staying on high ground until the threat of a repeat wave was gone.",
      "Russia\u2019s Tass news agency reported from the biggest city near the epicenter, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, that many people ran out into the street without shoes or outerwear. Cabinets toppled inside homes, mirrors were broken, cars swayed in the street, and balconies on buildings shook noticeably.",
      "Tass also reported power outages and mobile phone service failures in the capital of the Kamchatka region.",
      "The National Tsunami Warning Center, based in Alaska, issued a tsunami warning for parts of the Alaska Aleutian Islands and a watch for parts of the West Coast, including California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as Hawaii.",
      "The advisory also includes a vast swath of Alaska\u2019s coastline, including parts of the panhandle.",
      "Japan, part of the area known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, is one of the world\u2019s most quake-prone countries.",
      "Five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck in the sea near Kamchatka this month. The largest quake was about 90 miles east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000.",
      "On Nov. 4, 1952, a magnitude-9.0 quake in Kamchatka caused damage but no reported deaths even though it set off 30-foot waves in Hawaii."

      "With international fury reaching a crescendo, the Israeli military began limited pauses in fighting over the weekend to allow more supplies into the enclave \u2014 but aid organizations warned the trickle allowed in was not enough to stave off famine. Israel had allowed only a basic amount of aid into the territory for weeks after lifting a crippling blockade in May that barred the entry of food and other vital supplies."
