      "Justin Timberlake had \u201cTrolls.\u201d",
      "Justin Timberlake had \u201cTrolls.\u201d Rihanna has \u201cSmurfs.\u201d Now, we patiently await a \u201cGummi Bears\u201d with the Biebs.",
      "But first we have \u201cSmurfs,\u201d which, like \u201cTrolls,\u201d gets as much mileage as it can from its pop singer-voice actor. Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "The new \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d pretty much follows the plot of the 1997 film of the same name: A bunch of well-to-do young people get stalked and killed by a vengeful killer in a rain slicker with an ice hook. It even has some of the same stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",
      "That line deserves a big laugh from a so-called \u201clegacy sequel\u201d that blends old and new to resurrect a franchise long dormant but isn\u2019t sure where it sits in 2025. A wink here, an eye-gouging there.",
      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",
      "The new installment follows a group of post-high school friends (Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Sarah Pidgeon and Tyriq Withers) who cause a fatal car wreck on July Fourth and swear to keep their involvement a secret. But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",
      "In fact, you may find yourself rooting for the killer. The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",
      "No matter: We get the scene when a scared victim with a massive knife sticking out of her back shoots a harpoon gun at the hook killer, and that's why we came in the first place. We also get Hewitt screaming her catchphrase, mocking her attacker: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Well, what are you waiting for?",
      "\u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody horror violence, language throughout, some sexual content and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Romance novels have always spiced up quiet nights. Now, a genre that has sometimes been dismissed as a guilty pleasure is bringing readers and writers together through social media, book clubs and a growing number of romance-specific bookstores.",
      "At a recent launch party for Nora Dahlia's enemies-to-friends romance \u201cPick-Up\u201d at Lovestruck Books, a romance-dedicated store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a crowd of women sipped cocktails from the bar-caf\u00e9 as they browsed the shelves.",
      "After Dahlia\u2019s reading, patrons stuck around to mingle, swap contact info and trade author recommendations.",
      "It was a particularly social event for a book talk. But the communal atmosphere is typical of events for romance fans.",

      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown season seven's winning couple Sunday evening after a tumultuous season",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown the winning couple of its seventh season Sunday evening, culminating a tumultuous summer full of explosive breakups and shock exits.",
      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",
      "\u201cI think me and her are actually really good for each other,\u201d Seeley said during a confessional interview. \u201cShe helps me kind of get out of my head and I help her, you know, be her true self and I calm her down in moments where she gets emotional or heated.\u201d",
      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",
      "Carthen chose to return to Williams but was left single after he recoupled with Casa Amor contestant Clarke Carraway. Vansteenberghe and Ortega stayed together, but her departure days later ultimately left him single.",
      "Carthen and Vansteenberghe ultimately recoupled in the same episode.",
      "\u201cFor our journey to be almost identical is mind-blowing to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation,\u201d Carthen said during a recent confessional interview. \u201cMaybe it was Nic this whole time and we\u2019ve just been so oblivious to it.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says he is considering revoking actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s U.S. citizenship",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he is considering \u201ctaking away\u201d the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.",
      "\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday. He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \u201cif they want her.\u201d",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Trump\u2019s involvement in politics. In recent days, O\u2019Donnell on social media denounced Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.",
      "But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the United States and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2013 but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteen Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",
      "\u201cThe president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen,\" Frost said in an email Saturday. \u201cIn short, we are nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\u201d",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "Responding to Trump Saturday, O\u2019Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and \u201cadd me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In a small bookstore in the Caribbean's largest mall, dozens of people gathered on a recent evening for the launch of a slim dictionary. Its title is \u201cThe ABC of DtMF,\u201d which is short for \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d the newest album from Puerto Rico's latest prodigious son, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny.",
      "The mostly older crowd flipped through the pages, seeking to understand more about Puerto Rico's culture, the places, phrases and references in Bad Bunny's music.",
      "The singer has elevated the global profile of the island, a U.S. territory, to new heights, promoting its traditional music, denouncing its gentrification and challenging its political status.",
      "It was an unexpected opportunity for an island that for years has cried out about its territorial status, dwindling affordable housing, high cost of living, chronic power outages, medical exodus and fragile economy. Pleas for change have been largely pushed aside, but Puerto Ricans are optimistic that Bad Bunny\u2019s new album and his series of 30 concerts that began Friday means they\u2019ll finally be heard.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring change, and there\u2019s a young generation who\u2019s going to back him,\u201d said Luis Rosado, 57, who this week attended the dictionary launch at the urging of his son, who lives abroad.",
      "Ten minutes before the first concert on Friday, a giant billboard on stage lit up with the words, \u201cPuerto Rico is a colony since Christopher Columbus \u2018discovered\u2019 the island during his second trip to the New World in 1493.\u201d",
      "The crowd that filled the 18,000-capacity coliseum whooped.",
      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown on Friday pleaded not guilty to two further charges related to the serious beating of a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.",
      "Brown, 36, denied the more serious charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm at a hearing last month.",
      "The singer, wearing a light brown suit, pleaded not guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm to Abraham Diaw at the Tape nightclub in the swanky London neighborhood of Mayfair in February 2023.",
      "He also denied having an offensive weapon \u2014 a bottle \u2014 in a public place during the short hearing at Southwark Crown Court.",
      "Around 20 fans sat in the public gallery behind the dock for Friday\u2019s hearing, with several gasping as the singer of \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d \u201cRun It\u201d and \u201cKiss Kiss\u201d walked into the courtroom.",

      "Brown was released in May on bail of 5 million pounds ($6.75 million), which allowed him to start his \u201cBreezy Bowl XX\u201d tour. Following a series of dates in Europe, he's set to return to North America at the end of July to play in Miami, before moving across the U.S. with a two-night stop in Toronto along the way.",
      "Brown, who rose to stardom as a teen in 2005, won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \u201cF.A.M.E..\u201d He earned his second in the same category for \u201c11:11 (Deluxe)\u201d earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\" is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a new 4K restoration and a theatrical re-release",
      "Jack Nicholson did not want to go to the Oscars. It was 1976 and he was nominated for best actor in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d The Milo\u0161 Forman film, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a nationwide theatrical re-release on July 13 and July 16, had become a bit of a sensation \u2014 the second highest grossing picture of 1975, behind \u201cJaws,\u201d and had received nine Oscar nominations.",
      "But Nicholson wasn\u2019t feeling optimistic. In five years, he\u2019d already been nominated five times. He\u2019d also lost five times. And he told his producer, Michael Douglas, that he couldn\u2019t go through it again.",
      "\u201cI remember how hard I had to persuade Jack to come to the ceremony. He was so reluctant, but we got him there,\u201d Douglas said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then of course we lost the first four awards. Jack was sitting right in front of me and sort of leaned back and said \u2019Oh, Mikey D, Mikey D, I told you, man.\u2019 I just said, \u2018Hang in there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Douglas, of course, was right. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d would go on to sweep the \u201cbig five\u201d \u2014 screenplay, director, actor, actress and picture \u2014 the first film to do so in 41 years, (\u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d in 1934) which only \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d has done since. That night was one of many vindicating moments for a film that no one wanted to make or distribute that has quite literally stood the test of time.",
      "\u201cThis is my first 50th anniversary,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first movie I ever produced. To have a movie that\u2019s so lasting, that people get a lot out of, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s bringing back a lot of great memories.\u201d",
      "The film adaption of Ken Kesey\u2019s countercultural novel was a defining moment for Douglas, a son of Hollywood who was stuck in television and got a lifeline to film when his father, Kirk Douglas, gave him the rights to the book, and many of the then-unknown cast like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.",
      "DeVito was actually the first person officially cast. Douglas, who\u2019d known him for nearly 10 years, brought Forman to see him play Martini on stage.",
      "\u201cMilo\u0161 said, \u2018Yes! Danny! Perfect! Cast!\u2019 Douglas said in his best Czech accent. \u201cIt was a big moment for Danny. But I always knew how talented he was.\u201d",
      "Though the film's themes are challenging, unlike many of its New Hollywood contemporaries it wasn\u2019t a tortured shoot by any stretch. They had their annoyances (like Forman refusing to show the cast dailies) and more serious trials (they found out halfway through production that William Redfield was dying of leukemia), but for the most part it was fun.",
      "\u201cWe were very serious about the work, because Milo\u0161 was very serious. And we had the material, Kesey\u2019s work, and the reverence for that. We were not frivolous about it. But we did have a ball doing it,\u201d DeVito said, laughing.",
      "Part of that is because they filmed on location at a real state hospital in Salem, Oregon. Everyone stayed in the same motel and would board the same bus in the morning to get to set. It would have been hard not to bond and even harder if they hadn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cThere was full commitment,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThat comes when you don\u2019t go home at night to your own lives. We stopped for lunch on the first day and I saw Jack kind of push his tray away and go outside to get some air. I said, \u2018Jack, you OK?\u2019 He said, \u2019Who are these guys? Nobody breaks character! It\u2019s lunch time and they\u2019re all acting the same way!'\u201d",
      "Not disproving Nicholson\u2019s point, DeVito remembers he and the cast even asked if they could just sleep in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let us,\u201d DeVito said. \u201cThe floor above us had some seriously disturbed people who had committed murder.\u201d",
      "The film will be in theaters again on July 13 and July 16 from Fathom Entertainment. It\u2019s a new 4K restoration from the Academy Film Archive and Teatro Della Pace Films with an introduction by Leonard Maltin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous print and reminds me how good the sound was,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "DeVito thinks it, \u201cholds up in a really big way, because Milo\u0161 really was paying attention to all great things in the screenplay and the story originally.\u201d",
      "Besides the shock of \u201choly Toledo, am I that old?\u201d DeVito said that it was a treasure to be part of \u2014 and he continues to see his old friends, including Douglas, Lloyd and, of course, Nicholson, who played the protagonist, R.P. McMurphy.",
      "One person Douglas thinks hasn\u2019t gotten the proper attention for his contributions to \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d is producer Saul Zaentz, who died in 2014. His music company, Fantasy Records who had Creedence Clearwater Revival, funded the endeavor which started at a $1.6 million budget and ballooned to $4 million by the end. He was a gambler, Douglas said, and it paid off.",
      "And whatever sour grapes might have existed between Douglas and his father, who played R.P. McMurphy on Broadway and dreamt of doing so on film, were perhaps over-exaggerated. It was ultimately important for their relationship.",
      "\u201cMcMurphy is as good a part as any actor is going to get, and I\u2019m now far enough in my career to understand maybe you have four, maybe five good parts, really great parts. I\u2019m sure for dad that was one of them,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "\u201cTo not be able to see it through was probably disappointing on one side. On the other, the fact that his son did it and the picture turned out so good? Thank God the picture turned out. It would have been a disaster if it hadn\u2019t.\"",
      "Douglas added: \u201cIt was a fairy tale from beginning to end. I doubt anything else really came close to it. Even my Oscar for best actor years later didn\u2019t really surpass that moment very early in my career.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Forty years ago, the legendary Live Aid concerts aimed to do a lot of good \u2014 helping to raise over $100 million for famine relief in Ethiopia and inspiring worldwide awareness for a cause it might otherwise have ignored.",
      "Simulcast from Philadelphia and London on July 13, 1985, Live Aid was the most ambitious global television event of its time: 16 hours of live music in two different continents featuring Queen, The Who, a Led Zeppelin reunion and more.",
      "A lot has changed in the years since. \u201cLive Aid, '85 to now, is the same distance as the Second World War from Live Aid,\u201d notes Rick Springfield, laughingly. \u201cThat\u2019s how long ago it was.\u201d",
      "Artists who performed at Live Aid \u2014 Springfield, organizer Bob Geldof, Hall and Oates' John Oates and Judas Priest's Rob Halford \u2014 reflected on the event and its impact in interviews with The Associated Press ahead of the 40th anniversary on Sunday.",
      "Here's what they had to say:",
      "At John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Springfield performed between Run-DMC and REO Speedwagon \u2014 just a taste of the diversity of performers featured on the transnational lineup. \u201cRun-DMC, I remember thinking, \u2018What is this? Three guys talking over a record player. What is that? Little did I know that it was about to change the whole game,\u201d he says, laughing. He remembers playing an electric set \u2014 no \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl,\u201d because \u201cback then, it was just my first hit. ... It hadn't gone on to become this cultural thing.\"",
      "Hall and Oates' John Oates had a different experience. His band also played in Philly \u2014 their hometown \u2014 and in 1985, his band was one of the biggest on the planet. They played near the end of the night, joined by the Temptations' Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin and remained on stage to back the Rolling Stones' dynamic frontman Mick Jagger. The British rockstar had a trick up his sleeve.",
      "\u201cHe didn't tell us that he was bringing Tina Turner out,\u201d Oates says. \u201cWe had rehearsed a certain amount of songs with him. But then when he brought her out, it just jacked up the level of energy like you can\u2019t believe.\u201d",
      "Judas Priest singer Rob Halford counts \u201cMike and Tina, of course,\u201d as one of his Philly Live Aid highlights. \u201cLed Zeppelin, too.\u201d",
      "But most exciting of all for the heavy metal frontman? Meeting folk hero Joan Baez. The band had previously covered her classic \u201cDiamonds and Rust.\"",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s gonna come and kick me in the ass for wrecking her beautiful song,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe gives me a quick hug and goes, \u2018The reason I\u2019m here is because my son said to me, if you see Rob Halford from Judas Priest at the Live Aid Show in Philadelphia, will you tell him from me that I prefer Judas Priest\u2019s version to my mom\u2019s version?' ... It was a display of such kindness.\"",
      "Twenty years after Live Aid, Geldof organized Live 8 \u2014 an even larger undertaking in the new internet era, with 10 concerts happening simultaneously and across the globe.",
      "If the trend were to continue, there should be another event taking place this year. Notably, there isn't.",
      "Geldof says that's because there couldn't be a Live Aid-type event in 2025. He cites social media as a cause. In his view, algorithmic fracturing has made it impossible to create monolithic musical and activistic moments. Instead, he views the current media landscape as bolstering \"an echo chamber of your own prejudices.\u201d",
      "For something like Live Aid to work, \u201cYou need rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as a creature of a social, economic and technological movement,\" he says. \u201cAnd I think the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll age is over. ... It did determine how young people articulated change and the desire for it. ... That isn't the case anymore.\u201d",
      "Springfield agrees. \u201cI think we are too divided,\u201d he says. He believes the world wouldn't be able to agree on a single cause to support, or even which musicians to back. \u201cYou could never do a thing with the size of Live Aid unless it was some kind of universal thing of, \u2018Let\u2019s bring everybody together.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNever say never, but I highly doubt it,\u201d says Oates. \u201cThe landscape of music and entertainment in general has changed so drastically.\"",
      "He points to \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d the 1985 charity single for African famine relief that included the voices of Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon and many more, as an example. \u201cThe idea of that happening with the stars of today all in one place, I can\u2019t even imagine that. And plus, who would they be? ... How many songs are released every day?\u201d",
      "Halford echoes the other's sentiments. There's an undeniable \u201cextremism in the world right now,\u201d he says, that would make a Live Aid event challenging to pull off in 2025. But he doesn't think it's impossible. He uses January's Fire Aid \u2014 the LA wildfire benefit concert featuring Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder and a Nirvana reunion \u2014 as a recent example.",
      "\u201cThere will always be empathy from people,\u201d and in the right hands, maybe another event like Live Aid could take place. \u201cIt was a tremendously beautiful, humanitarian example ... that provided us opportunity to do something ourselves to help.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega apologized Wednesday for resurfaced posts where she used a racial slur against Asian people.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained the slur.",

      "\u201cThis is not an apology video. This is an accountability video,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that the word held as much pain, as much harm, and came with the history that it did, or I never would have used it,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI had no ill intention when I was using it, but that\u2019s absolutely no excuse because intent doesn\u2019t excuse ignorance.\u201d",
      "Ortega, who has been back in the United States for about 48 hours, said she has struggled most with the backlash experienced by her family, who she said doesn't feel safe in their own home, and have had immigration authorities called on them.",
      "\u201cThere's no need to fight hate with hate. I don't think that that's justice,\" Ortega said. \"And if you want to know that you're heard and that I'm sorry and that I will move differently, I promise you, that's what will happen.\u201d",
      "Ortega\u2019s removal from the villa was announced early in Sunday\u2019s episode. Host Iain Stirling said she had left \u201cdue to a personal situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI completely agree with the network\u2019s decision to remove me from the villa. I think that this is something that deserved punishment and the punishment has absolutely been received,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Her video made no mention of her \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Nic Vansteenberghe. He remained in the villa single when Ortega left, ultimately recoupling with fellow islander Orlandria Carthen in the same episode. The couple is still in competition as of Tuesday\u2019s episode.",
      "Ortega said she was unaware she was using a racial slur until a follower pointed it out after she posted an Instagram story in 2024 that used the term. It was one of the posts that resurfaced during her time in the villa.",
      "At this point, Ortega said \u201cthe word was immediately removed from my vocabulary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that moving forward, my actions and how I decide to live my life from here on out is gonna speak louder than any apology ever could,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Ortega\u2019s departure from the villa followed Yulissa Escobar, who left the villa last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",
      "Escobar, who initially issued an apology on her Instagram story shortly after she departed the villa, took to TikTok a day after Ortega left to ask viewers to stop cyberbullying contestants.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed how his son and several close friends benefited from using psychedelics to deal with grief and other issues.",
      "A number of veterans lobbying for psychedelic access have already met with Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is positive,\u201d Collins told House lawmakers in May.",
      "But some experts worry the hope and hype surrounding psychedelics has gotten ahead of the science.",
      "Philip Corlett, a psychiatric researcher at Yale University, says bypassing rigorous clinical trials could set back the field and jeopardize patients.",
      "\"If RFK and the new administration are serious about this work, there are things they could do to shepherd it into reality by meeting the benchmarks of medical science,\" Corlett said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "As officials in Washington weigh the future of psychedelics, some states are moving ahead with their own projects in hopes of nudging the federal government. Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.",
      "And last month, Texas approved $50 million to study ibogaine, a potent psychedelic made from a shrub that's native to West Africa, as a treatment for opioid addiction, PTSD and other conditions. The research grant \u2014 the largest of its kind by any government \u2014 passed with support from the state's former GOP governor, Perry, and combat veterans, some who have traveled to clinics in Mexico that offer ibogaine.",
      "Ibogaine is on the U.S. government\u2019s ultra-restrictive list of illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates in Texas are hoping to build a national movement to ease restrictions on researching its use.",
      "\u201cGovernmental systems move slowly and inefficiently,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard of Americans for Ibogaine, a group formed with Perry. \u201cSometimes you find yourself constrained in terms of the progress you can make from within.\u201d",
      "Ibogaine is unique among psychedelics in both its purported benefits and risks. Small studies and anecdotal reports suggest the drug may be able to dramatically ease addiction and trauma. It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",
      "Some veterans who have taken the drug say the risks can be managed and ibogaine\u2019s healing properties go far beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling and other standard treatments.",
      "Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia and mood swings after 13 years as a Navy Seal. In 2017, at the urging of his wife Amber, he agreed to try ibogaine as a last resort. He described his first ibogaine session as \u201ca complete purge of everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut afterward I felt the weight just completely off my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more anxiety, no more depression, life made sense all of a sudden.\u201d",
      "A nonprofit founded by the Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, has helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad to receive ibogaine and other psychedelics.",
      "But federal scientists have looked at the drug before \u2014 three decades ago, when the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies on using it as an addiction treatment. The research was discontinued after it identified \u201ccardiovascular toxicity.\"",
      "\u201cIt would be dead in the water,\u201d in terms of winning FDA approval, longtime NIDA director Nora Volkow said.",
      "But Volkow said her agency remains interested in psychedelics, including ibogaine, and is funding an American drugmaker that's working to develop a safer, synthetic version of the drug.",
      "\u201cI am very intrigued by their pharmacological properties and how they are influencing the brain,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cBut you also have to be very mindful not to fall into the hype and to be objective and rigorous in evaluating them.\u201d",

      "South Africa has played a historic, global role in scientific research, from COVID-19 vaccines to HIV",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",
      "Other countries that were highly dependent on U.S. funding including Zambia, Nigeria, Burundi and Ivory Coast are already increasing their own resources, she said.",
      "\u201cBut let\u2019s be clear, what they are putting down will not be funding in the same way that the American resources were funding,\" Byanyima said.",

      "Dozens of ice cream makers pledged on Monday to remove artificial dyes from their products by 2028",
      "Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.",
      "The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

      "When they eventually found Dr. Claudette Yam\u00e9ogo, Burkina Faso\u2019s only pediatric ophthalmologist, the injury had become too difficult to treat.",
      "\u201cThe trauma has become severe,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said of Diallo\u2019s condition as she attended to him recently at the Sanou Sourou University Hospital in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cCases like (Diallo\u2019s) must be treated within the first six hours, but I\u2019m seeing him two weeks later, and it\u2019s already too late.\u201d",
      "It is a common problem in the country of about 23 million people, which has just 70 ophthalmologists.",
      "Yam\u00e9ogo , who started her practice late last year, said the work is daunting and often requires her to visit \u2014 at no cost \u2014 families who cannot afford care or cannot make their way to the hospital where she works.",

      "Late intervention can significantly alter a child\u2019s future, the organization said, with many such cases in less developed countries.",
      "In Burkina Faso, an estimated 70% of the population lives in rural areas. And yet ophthalmologists are concentrated in the capital, Ouagadougou, and other main cities, making them unreachable for many.",
      "While more than 2,000 ophthalmology procedures were performed in Burkina Faso\u2019s western Hauts-Bassins region in 2024, only 52 of those were carried out in its more rural areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Most procedures were done in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso\u2019s second city.",

      "To visit Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s hospital from the village where they are sheltering, they had to travel about 40 kilometers (21 miles) on a motorcycle to Bobo-Dioulasso, spending 7,500 francs ($13) on transport, a high price for a small-scale farming family.",
      "At least 70% of the trauma cases in children treated at the hospital come from rural areas where the risk of exposure \u2014 from conflict or from play \u2014 is higher, Yam\u00e9ogo said.",
      "Examining and treating a child is a delicate practice that requires a lot of time, something many families can\u2019t afford. Many must return home to earn money for the treatment.",

      "\u201cA child\u2019s eye is not the same as that of an adult, which is why we need specialists to treat problems early so the child can develop properly,\u201d Diallo said.",
      "He cited retinoblastoma, a retinal cancer mostly affecting young children, and congenital cataracts, eye diseases that can be cured if diagnosed early. Pediatricians won\u2019t necessarily detect them.",
      "During another consultation, Yam\u00e9ogo told the family of 5-year-old Fatao Traor\u00e9 that he would need cornea surgery as a result of an injury sustained while playing with a stick.",

      "North Carolina's first standalone children\u2019s hospital will be built in a bedroom community of Raleigh",
      "APEX, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s first standalone children\u2019s hospital will be built in a bedroom community near the state capital, the project\u2019s health systems announced Thursday, creating a campus estimated to bring 8,000 jobs to the area.",
      "UNC Health and Duke Health announced in January an agreement to jointly build the proposed 500-bed pediatric hospital and linked facilities in the state\u2019s Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.",
      "At that time, the specific location wasn't finalized. But leaders of the health systems said Thursday that the \u201cNorth Carolina Children's\u201d project will be constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest of downtown Raleigh in the Wake County town of Apex. Apex has a population of 77,000, which is already surging in population thanks to the region's strong technology economy.",
      "More than 15 potential sites in several counties were considered, Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese said at an Apex news conference.",
      "The 230-acre (93.1-hectare) campus, located near a regional transportation interchange, will also include a children\u2019s outpatient care center, over 100 behavioral health beds and a research and education center operated by Duke University and University of North Carolina medical schools.",
      "The campus is poised to be integrated into a long-discussed mixed-use development location called Veridea that will include thousands of new homes, retail, dining, office and research space, as well as a new Wake Technical Community College campus.",
      "\u201cThis campus will create a brighter, healthier future for generations of children and adolescents across North Carolina and the Southeast, and we\u2019re thrilled to have Apex as our home and partner,\" UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said in a news release.",
      "A groundbreaking for the hospital campus is now expected in 2027, with construction anticipated to take six years. North Carolina Children\u2019s Health also issued on Thursday a request for information from potential design and construction contractors for the project.",
      "There are children\u2019s hospitals already in North Carolina, including those operated by the University of North Carolina and Duke University health systems that are attached to their main campuses in the Triangle.",
      "The Apex location \u201cwill ensure that the Triangle remains a hub and a destination for the best pediatric scientists, teachers and clinicians \u2014 convenient to both medical school campuses,\u201d said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean of the Duke University medical school and a Duke Health executive.",
      "The new children's hospital agreed to acquire a portion of the Veridea land, which is owned by a business partnership between the North Carolina state retirement system and the land developers, according to the State Treasurer's Office, which administers the system.",
      "State Treasurer Brad Briner said at the news conference that the land sale is a win for everyone involved, including government retirees and the pension system, \"making a modest profit and unlocking more value in the land that is adjacent.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove all, it's a win for the 11 million North Carolinians who deserve world-class pediatric care right here at home,\u201d he added.",
      "The health systems have said the hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion to $3 billion, with a massive private fundraising effort ahead.",
      "The project has already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated by House and Senate Republicans that ultimately would head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk, also could contain more project funds.",
      "Stein said in an interview Thursday that beyond the economic opportunity the project will spark, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what the children\u2019s hospital means for children of North Carolina who are sick and in need of the best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions to live long, healthy lives.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ultimatum to Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine within 50 days or face bruising sanctions has given the Kremlin extra time to pursue its summer offensive",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s ultimatum to Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine within 50 days or face bruising sanctions on its energy exports has given the Kremlin extra time to pursue its summer offensive.",
      "The dogged Ukrainian resistance, however, makes it unlikely that the Russian military will make any quick gains.",
      "President Vladimir Putin has declared repeatedly that any peace deal should see Ukraine withdraw from the four regions that Russia illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured. He also wants Ukraine to renounce its bid to join NATO and accept strict limits on its armed forces -\u2013 demands Kyiv and its Western allies have rejected.",
      "A chronic shortage of manpower and ammunition has forced Ukrainian forces to focus on holding ground rather than launching counteroffensives.",
      "But despite a renewed Russian push \u2014 and an onslaught of aerial attacks on Kyiv and other cities in recent weeks \u2014 Ukrainian officials and analysts say it remains unlikely that Moscow can achieve any territorial breakthrough significant enough in 50 days to force Ukraine into accepting the Kremlin's terms anytime soon.",
      "Since spring, Russian troops have accelerated their land gains, capturing the most territory in eastern Ukraine since the opening stages of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "Russian forces are closing in on the eastern strongholds of Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region, methodically capturing villages near both cities to try to cut key supply routes and envelop their defenders \u2014 a slow offensive that has unfolded for months.",
      "Capturing those strongholds would allow Russia to push toward Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, setting the stage for the seizure of the entire Donetsk region.",
      "If Russian troops seize those last strongholds, it would open the way for them to forge westward to the Dnipropetrovsk region. The regional capital of Dnipro, a major industrial hub of nearly 1 million, is about 150 kilometers (just over 90 miles) west of Russian positions.",
      "The spread of fighting to Dnipropetrovsk could damage Ukrainian morale and give the Kremlin more leverage in any negotiations.",
      "In the neighboring Luhansk region, Ukrainian troops control a small sliver of land, but Moscow has not seemed to prioritize its capture.",
      "The other two Moscow-annexed regions \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2014 seem far from being totally overtaken by Russia.",
      "Early in the war, Russia quickly overran the Kherson region but was pushed back by Ukrainian forces from large swaths of it in November 2022, and retreated to the eastern bank of the Dnieper River. A new attempt to cross the waterway to seize the rest of the region would involve massive challenges, and Moscow doesn\u2019t seem to have the capability to mount such an operation.",
      "Fully capturing the Zaporizhzhia region appears equally challenging.",
      "Moscow\u2019s forces captured several villages in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy region after reclaiming chunks of Russia\u2019s Kursk region from Ukrainian troops who staged a surprise incursion in August 2024. Ukraine says its forces have stopped Russia's offensive and maintain a presence on the fringe of the Kursk region, where they are still tying down as many as 10,000 Russian troops.",
      "Putin recently described the offensive into the Sumy region as part of efforts to carve a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d to protect Russian territory from Ukrainian attacks.",
      "The regional capital of Sumy, a city of 268,000, is about 30 kilometers (less than 20 miles) from the border. Putin said Moscow doesn\u2019t plan to capture the city for now but doesn\u2019t exclude it.",
      "Military analysts, however, say Russian forces in the area clearly lack the strength to capture it.",
      "Russian forces also have pushed an offensive in the neighboring Kharkiv region, but they haven't made much progress against fierce Ukrainian resistance.",
      "Some commentators say Russia may hope to use its gains in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions as bargaining chips in negotiations, trading them for parts of the Donetsk region under Ukrainian control.",
      "\u201cA scenario of territorial swaps as part of the talks is quite realistic,\u201d said Mikhail Karyagin, a Kremlin-friendly political expert, in a commentary,",
      "Ukrainian commanders say the scale and pace of Russian operations suggest that any game-changing gains are out of reach, with Moscow\u2019s troops advancing slowly at a tremendous cost to its own forces.",
      "While exhausted Ukrainian forces are feeling outnumbered and outgunned, they are relying on drones to stymie Moscow's slow offensive. Significant movements of troops and weapons are easily spotted by drones that are so prolific that both sides use them to track and attack even individual soldiers within minutes.",
      "Russian military commentators recognize that Ukraine\u2019s drone proficiency makes any quick gains by Moscow unlikely. They say Russia aims to bleed Ukraine dry with a strategy of \u201ca thousand cuts,\u201d using relentless pressure on many sectors of the front and steadily increasing long-range aerial attacks against key infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe Russian army aims to exhaust the enemy to such an extent that it will not be able to hold the defense, and make multiple advances merge into one or several successes on a strategic scale that will determine the outcome of the war,\u201d Moscow-based military analyst Sergei Poletayev wrote in an analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s not that important where and at what speed to advance: the target is not the capture of this or that line; the target is the enemy army as such.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian troops on the front express exasperation and anger about delays and uncertainty about U.S. weapons shipments.",
      "Delays in U.S. military assistance have forced Kyiv's troops to ration ammunition and scale back operations as Russia intensifies its attacks, Ukrainian soldiers in eastern Ukraine told The Associated Press.",
      "The United States will sell weapons to its NATO allies in Europe so they can provide them to Ukraine, according to Trump and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Included are Patriot air defense systems, a top priority for Ukraine.",
      "Speeded-up weapons shipments from European allies are crucial to allowing Ukraine to stem the Russian attacks, according to analysts.",
      "\u201cThe rate of Russian advance is accelerating, and Russia\u2019s summer offensive is likely to put the armed forces of Ukraine under intense pressure,\u201d Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute in London said in a commentary.",
      "But most of the capabilities that Ukraine needs \u2014 from drones to artillery systems \u2014 can be provided by NATO allies in Europe, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the short-term, Europe can cover most of Ukraine\u2019s needs so long as it can purchase some critical weapons types from the U.S.,\u201d Watling said.",

      "A campsite in the town of Grindavik was evacuated shortly after the seismic activity began. Guests at the Blue Lagoon were forced to quickly pack their bags, RUV reported.",
      "Lava from the eruption is flowing southeast from a fissure in the barren landscape that is 700 to 1,000 meters (2,296 to 3,280 feet) wide, but the molten rock isn\u2019t threatening any infrastructure, the Met Office said.",
      "Grindavik has been repeatedly affected by the activity since November 2023 when a volcano in the area came to life after lying dormant for some 800 years. But authorities said Wednesday it is not in danger.",

      "A Japanese man has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison in China on espionage charges",
      "BEIJING -- A Japanese man was sentenced Wednesday to three and a half years in prison in China on espionage charges, according to the Japanese embassy in Beijing.",
      "The embassy did not identify the man, who has been detained since March 2023. Japan's Kyodo News Agency described him as a man in his 60s and an employee of Astellas Pharma Inc., a major Japanese pharmaceutical company.",
      "The man was charged with espionage in August and his first hearing was held in November but no details were released.",
      "The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People\u2019s Court did not immediately make an announcement after handing down the sentence.",
      "Kenji Kanasugi, the Japanese ambassador to China, called the sentencing \u201cextremely regrettable.\" The Japanese government has protested a series of detentions of its citizens in China.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that judicial authorities had handled the case in strict accordance with the law and that China provides a sound environment for Japanese companies and workers.",
      "\"As long as foreign nationals in China abide by the law and engage in lawful employment, there is nothing to worry about,\u201d he said.",
      "A total of 17 Japanese citizens with business or other connections to China have been detained since 2014, when China enacted the anti-spying law. Five remain in China, Kyodo reported. A Japanese diplomat was detained for questioning in 2022 and released hours later, prompting strong protests from Japan.",
      "Kanasugi was present at Wednesday's ruling, but Japanese reporters were not allowed inside the courtroom. He told reporters that Japan has demanded and will continue to demand the early release of detained Japanese nationals, adding that such detentions are \u201cone of the biggest obstacles to improving people-to-people exchanges and public sentiment between Japan and China.\u201d",
      "A statement released by the Japanese embassy in Beijing urged the Chinese government to ensure the humane treatment of detainees and to improve the transparency of the judicial process.",
      "Japan considers China's growing influence in the region as a threat to its national security and economy, and the risks of getting caught in China on espionage allegations are a growing concern in Japan, including its business community.

      "Bangladesh was at the precipice of charting a new beginning last year after its former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed from power in a student-led uprising",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh was on the cusp of charting a new beginning last year after its former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was removed from power in a student-led uprising, ending her 15-year rule and forcing her to flee to India.",
      "As the head of a new interim government, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus promised to hold a credible election to return to democracy, initiate electoral and constitutional reforms and restore peace on the streets after hundreds were killed in weeks of violence that began on July 15, 2024.",
      "A year later, the Yunus-led administration has struggled to contain the fallout of the uprising. Bangladesh finds itself mired in a growing political uncertainty, religious polarization and a challenging law-and-order situation.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Bangladesh a year after the protests that toppled Hasina.",
      "Uncertainty about the future of democracy looms large in Bangladesh.",
      "The student protesters who toppled Hasina formed a new political party, promising to break the overwhelming influence of two major dynastic political parties \u2014 the Bangladesh Nationalists Party, or BNP, and Hasina\u2019s Awami League.",
      "But the party's opponents have accused it of being close to the Yunus-led administration and creating chaos for political mileage by using state institutions.",
      "Meanwhile, Bangladesh's political landscape has further fragmented after the country\u2019s largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, returned to politics more than a decade after it was suppressed by Hasina\u2019s government.",
      "Aligned with the student-led party, it's trying to fill the vacuum left by the Awami League, which was banned in May. Its leader, Hasina, is facing trial for crimes against humanity. The strength of Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971, is unknown.",
      "Both BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami party are now at loggerheads over establishing supremacy within the administration and judiciary, and even university campuses.",
      "They are also differing over the timing of a new parliamentary election. Yunus has announced that the polls would be held in April next year, but poor law and order situation and a lack of clear-cut political consensus over it have created confusion. The chief of Bangladesh's military also wanted an election in December this year \u2014 a stance Yunus didn't like.",
      "\u201cPost-revolution honeymoons often don\u2019t last long, and Bangladesh is no exception,\u201d says Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and senior fellow of Asia Pacific Foundation. \u201cThe interim government faced massive expectations to restore democracy and prosperity. But this is especially difficult to do as an unelected government without a public mandate.\"",
      "Yunus has delayed an election because he wants reforms \u2014 from changes to the constitution and elections to the judiciary and police. Discussions with political parties, except Hasina's Awami League, are ongoing.",
      "Some of the reforms include putting a limit on how many times a person can become the prime minister, introduction of a two-tier parliament, and appointment of a chief justice.",
      "There appears to be little consensus over some basic reforms. While both the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami parties have agreed to some of them with conditions, other proposals for basic constitutional reforms have become a sticking point.",
      "The Jamaat-e-Islami also wants to give the interim government more time to complete reforms before heading into polls, while BNP has been calling for an early election. The student-led party mostly follows the pattern of the Jamaat-e-Islami party.",
      "Kugelman says the issue of reforms was meant to unite the country, but has instead become a flashpoint.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a divide between those that want to see through reforms and give them more time, and those that feel it\u2019s time to wrap things up and focus on elections,\u201d he says.",
      "Human rights in Bangladesh have remained a serious concern under Yunus.",
      "Minority groups, especially Hindus, have blamed his administration for failing to protect them adequately. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council says minority Hindus and others have been targeted in hundreds of attacks over the last year. Hasina\u2019s party has also blamed the interim government for arresting tens of thousands of its supporters.",
      "The Yunus-led administration denies these allegations.",
      "Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, says while the interim government has stopped enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions that had occurred under the Hasina government, \u201cthere has been little progress on lasting security sector reforms or to deliver on the pledge to create robust, independent institutions.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Islamist factions \u2014 some of whom have proposed changes to women\u2019s rights and demanded introduction of Sharia law \u2014 are vying for power. Many of them are planning to build alliances with bigger parties like the BNP or the Jamaat-e-Islami.",
      "Such factions have historically struggled to gain significant electoral support despite Bangladesh being a Muslim majority, and their rise is expected to further fragment the country's political landscape.",
      "During Hasina's 15-year rule, Bangladesh was India\u2019s closest partner in South Asia. After her ouster, the Yunus-led administration has moved closer to China, which is India\u2019s main rival in the region.",
      "Yunus\u2019 first state visit was to China in March, a trip that saw him secure investments, loans and grants. On the other hand, India is angered by the ousting of its old ally Hasina and hasn't responded to Dhaka\u2019s requests to extradite her. India stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis following Hasina's fall.",
      "Globally, Yunus seems to have strong backing from the West and the United Nations, and it appears Bangladesh will continue its foreign policy, which has long tried to find a balance between multiple foreign powers.",
      "But Kugelman says the country's biggest challenge may be the \u201cTrump factor.\u201d",
      "In January, the Trump administration suspended USAID funds to Bangladesh, which had sought significant levels of U.S. support during a critical rebuild period post Hasina's ouster.",
      "\u201cDhaka must now reframe its relations with an unconventional U.S. administration that will largely view Bangladesh through a commercial lens,\u201d Kugelman says.",

      "India\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aviation stated the directive would apply to Boeing 787 Dreamliners and select Boeing 737 variants and that airlines must complete inspections and submit their findings to the regulator by July 21.",
      "A preliminary report into the Air India crash that killed 260 people in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad found that the switches shifted within one second of each other, cutting off fuel supply to both engines. The report, released last week, did not offer any conclusions as to why the plane crashed. It also did not say how the switches could have flipped from run position to the cutoff during the flight.",
      "The movement of the fuel control switches allows and cuts fuel flow to the plane\u2019s engines.",
      "The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed on June 12 shortly after takeoff. It killed all but one of the 242 people on board as well as 19 people on the ground.",
      "The report, issued by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, noted a 2018 advisory from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, recommending airlines operating Boeing models to inspect the locking feature of fuel cutoff switches.",
      "According to the report, cockpit voice recordings captured a moment of confusion between the pilots, with one asking the other why he cut off the fuel. \u201cThe other pilot responded that he did not do so,\u201d the report said.",
      "Some aviation experts in India speculated the crash was caused due to human error based on the preliminary report. At least two commercial pilots\u2019 associations have rejected such claims.",
      "The Indian Commercial Pilots\u2019 Association in a statement on Sunday said it was \u201cdeeply disturbed by speculative narratives ... particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide.\u201d",
      "Air India CEO Campbell Wilson on Monday said the preliminary report into the crash of the London-bound plane found no mechanical or maintenance issues with the aircraft and its engines.",
      "In an internal memo to airline staff seen by The Associated Press, Wilson said the report stated that all mandatory maintenance tasks of the aircraft had been completed.",
      "\u201cThere was no issue with the quality of fuel and no abnormality with the take-off roll. The pilots had passed their mandatory pre-flight breathalyser and there were no observations pertaining to their medical status,\u201d he said in the note.",
      "After the crash, Indian authorities ordered deeper checks of Air India\u2019s entire Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet to prevent future incidents. Air India has 33 Dreamliners in its fleet.",

      "The United States says it has sent five men to the small African nation of Eswatini in an expansion of the Trump administration\u2019s third-country deportation program",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The United States sent five men it describes as \u201cbarbaric\u201d criminals to the small African nation of Eswatini in an expansion of the Trump administration's largely secretive third-country deportation program, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. has already deported eight men to another African country, South Sudan, after the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on sending people to countries where they have no ties. The South Sudanese government has declined to say where those men, also described as violent criminals, are after it took custody of them nearly two weeks ago.",
      "In a late-night post on X, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the men sent to Eswatini, who are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos, had arrived on a plane, but didn't say when or where.",
      "She said they were all convicted criminals and \u201cindividuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.\u201d",
      "The men \u201chave been terrorizing American communities\" but were now \"off of American soil,\u201d McLaughlin added.",
      "McLaughlin said they had been convicted of crimes including murder and child rape and one was a \"confirmed\" gang member. Her social media posts included mug shots of the men and what she said were their criminal records. They were not named.",
      "Like in South Sudan, there was no immediate comment from Eswatini authorities over any deal to accept third-country deportees or what would happen to them in that country. Civic groups there raised concerns over the secrecy from a government long accused of clamping down on human rights.",
      "\u201cThere has been a notable lack of official communication from the Eswatini government regarding any agreement or understanding with the U.S. to accept these deportees,\u201d Ingiphile Dlamini, a spokesperson for the pro-democracy group SWALIMO, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cThis opacity makes it difficult for civic society to understand the implications.\"",
      "It wasn't clear if they were being held in a detention center, what their legal status was or what Eswatini's plans were for the deported men, he said.",
      "Eswatini, previously called Swaziland, is a country of about 1.2 million people between South Africa and Mozambique. It is one of the world\u2019s last remaining absolute monarchies and the last in Africa. King Mswati III has ruled by decree since 1986.",
      "Political parties are effectively banned and pro-democracy groups have said for years that Mswati III has crushed political dissent, sometimes violently. Groups like SWALIMO have called for democratic reforms.",
      "Pro-democracy protests erupted in Eswatini in 2021, when dozens were killed, allegedly by security forces. Eswatini authorities have been accused of conducting political assassinations of pro-democracy activists and imprisoning others.",
      "Because Eswatini is a poor country with a relative lack of resources, it \u201cmay face significant strain in accommodating and managing individuals with complex backgrounds, particularly those with serious criminal convictions,\u201d Dlamini said.",
      "While the U.S. administration has hailed deportations as a victory for the safety and security of the American people, Dlamini said his organization wanted to know the plans for the five men sent to Eswatini and \u201cany potential risks to the local population.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has said it is seeking more deals with African nations to take deportees from the U.S. Leaders from some of the five West African nations who met last week with President Donald Trump at the White House said the issue of migration and their countries possibly taking deportees from the U.S. was discussed.",
      "Some nations have pushed back. Nigeria, which wasn't part of that White House summit, said it has rejected pressure from the U.S. to take deportees who are citizens of other countries.",
      "The U.S. also has sent hundreds of Venezuelans and others to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, but has identified Africa as a continent where it might find more governments willing to strike deportation agreements.",
      "Rwanda\u2019s foreign minister told the AP last month that talks were underway with the U.S. about a potential agreement to host deported migrants. A British government plan announced in 2022 to deport rejected asylum-seekers to Rwanda was ruled illegal by the U.K. Supreme Court last year.",
      "The eight men deported by the U.S. to war-torn South Sudan, where they arrived early this month, previously spent weeks at a U.S. military base in nearby Djibouti, located on the northeast border of Ethiopia, as the case over the legality of sending them there played out.",
      "The South Sudanese government has not released details of its agreement with the U.S. to take deportees, nor has it said what will happen to the men. A prominent civil society leader there said South Sudan was \"not a dumping ground for criminals.\u201d",

At least nine abbots and senior monks involved in the scandal have been disrobed and cast out of the monkhood, the Royal Thai Police Central Investigation Bureau said.",
      "Wilawan Emsawat, in her mid-30s, was arrested at her home in Nonthaburi province north of the capital Bangkok on charges including extortion, money laundering and receiving stolen goods. Police said they traced money transferred to her by a senior monk from a bank account belonging to his temple in northern Thailand.",
      "Wilawan has not made a statement since her arrest and it was unclear if she has legal representation. Speaking to local media before her arrest, she acknowledged one relationship and said she had given money to that monk.",
      "Scandalsinvolving monks surface a few times a year in Thailand but usually don\u2019t involve senior members of the clergy. The case also puts a spotlight on the large sums of money donated to temples controlled by abbots, which is in marked contrast to the abstemious lives they are supposed to lead under their religion\u2019s precepts.",

      "Bangladeshi security forces have clashed with supporters of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, leaving at least three dead and scores injured",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladeshi security forces on Wednesday clashed with supporters of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, leaving at least three people dead and scores injured, a hospital official said.",
      "The violence erupted in the morning and spread as a new political party formed by students who led the uprising against Hasina in August last year announced a march toward southwestern Gopalganj district, Hasina\u2019s ancestral home, and her Awami League party\u2019s stronghold.",
      "TV footage showed pro-Hasina activists armed with sticks attacking police and setting vehicles on fire as a convoy of about 20 vehicles carrying the leaders of the National Citizen Party arrived as part of commemorations of the uprising. Top leaders of the party took shelter in the office of the local police chief as footage showed some of them were being escorted by soldiers to an armored vehicle for safety.",
      "Jibitesh Biswas, a senior official of a state-run hospital, told reporters that at least three people were brought in dead.",
      "Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since Hasina was toppled and fled to India. The interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, took over three days after her ouster and pledged to restore order. He said a new election would be held in April next year.",
      "Gopalganj is a politically sensitive district because Hasina father\u2019s mausoleum is located there. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country\u2019s independence leader, was buried there after he was assassinated along with most of his family members in a military coup in 1971.",
      "The students' party launched its \u201cJuly March to Rebuild the Nation\u201d on July 1 across all districts in Bangladesh as part of its drive to position itself as a new force in Bangladeshi politics, which as been largely dominated by two dynastic families.",
      "One is Hasina\u2019s Awami League party, and the other is the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, headed by Hasina\u2019s archrival Khaleda Zia, also a former prime minister.",

    "story": [
      "A music festival in Utsjoki, Finland, brings S\u00e1mi culture to the spotlight under the midnight sun",
      "UTSJOKI, Finland -- It was well past midnight when Mihkku Laiti appeared on stage to perform at an open-air music festival in the Finnish village of Utsjoki, north of the Arctic circle.",
      "Despite the time, Lapland\u2019s famous midnight sun was still up. During the summer months the sun doesn\u2019t go down at all in Utsjoki, which is less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Arctic Ocean.",
      "In the glow of blue spotlights, Laiti rapped while a crowd of more than 300 listened, some of them singing along and dancing. Like the majority of Utsjoki\u2019s residents, Laiti is a member of the S\u00e1mi \u2014 Europe's only recognized Indigenous people \u2014 and he rapped in his native S\u00e1mi language.",
      "Laiti, also known by his stage name \u201cYungmiqu,\u201d is the founder of the Loktafeasta rap festival. He first found fame on the television show Talent Finland, where he surprised the judges by rapping in the g\u00e1kti, the traditional dress of the S\u00e1mi. It is brightly colored and often characterized by plaits, pewter embroidery and a high collar.",
      "The festival brought Laiti\u2019s Indigenous culture to the spotlight, though some of his fans could not understand what he was saying. That didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone at the Loktafeasta as the festival mixed performances from artists in both S\u00e1mi language and Finnish.",
      "Some drank beer and ate sausages and the crowd seemed to enjoy the summer festival atmosphere despite spells of rain.",
      "\u201cWhen I rap about my culture ... I want to show how being S\u00e1mi is like from my point of view,\" Laiti told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cBecause there are many stereotypes about S\u00e1mi people and I want to like normalize ... the basic stuff we do and not romanticize those things,\u201d he said. He added that he has not worn the g\u00e1kti for performances for about a year now to show people that it is possible to be S\u00e1mi and wear whatever you want.",
      "The S\u00e1mi traditionally live in Lapland, which stretches from northern parts of Norway to Sweden and Finland to Russia. However, of the roughly 10,000 S\u00e1mi people living in Finland, the majority now live outside their homeland.",
      "The S\u00e1mi people were oppressed for centuries by the powers that ruled and exploited their lands, including bans of the use of their native tongues and efforts to suppress their culture. In the past decades, there have been efforts to reestablish their rights, including the right to use S\u00e1mi languages which is now guaranteed in the Finnish constitution.",
      "Today, the historically semi-nomadic S\u00e1mi people have modern lifestyles. The few who still tend reindeer do so with modern vehicles, digital tools and regulated land use.",
      "However, there is an effort to preserve the S\u00e1mi's cultural identity. Distinctive S\u00e1mi clothing was worn by many at Loktafeasta, as is typical on special occasions.",
      "At the festival, Laiti mostly wanted his fans to be happy and enjoy the music.",
      "\u201cI want people to feel joy, of course, and I just want people to be happy that we have this kind of festival here in Utsjoki,\" he said with a smile.",
      "Among the other acts was a duo comprised of self-confessed old school tango crooner Jaakko Laitinen and rapper Jouni J. They also reside in Lapland and perform in Finnish.",
      "\u201cI see a connection from the hip hop and the tinkering with words to the old Finnish like Kalevala freestyling folk poetry,\" said Laitinen, referring to Finland's national epic about the Earth's creation.",
      "\"So that obvious connection and the Finnish tango ... is part of our soul and heart,\u201d he added.",
      "Although the duo\u2019s songs were a world away from the birthplace of rap music in the Bronx in New York City, their performance brought joy to Utsjoki's locals and visitors.",
      "\u201cMusic travels and music brings people together. It\u2019s the magic of the international language of music,\u201d Laitinen said.",

      "France\u2019s prime minister has proposed cutting two public holidays to save money in next year\u2019s budget",
      "PARIS -- France\u2019s prime minister proposed on Tuesday the elimination of two public holidays from the country\u2019s annual calendar \u2014 possibly Easter Monday and the day marking the Allied victory over the Nazis \u2014 to save money in next year\u2019s budget.",
      "That's among a raft of spending cuts laid out by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou in a sweeping, and potentially doomed, budget plan. He argued that removing two state holidays would bring in tax revenues generated from economic activity, contributing to around 44 billion euros ($51.3 billion) in overall savings.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron tasked Bayrou with crafting a budget that shaves costs to bring down France\u2019s staggering debt and deficit \u2014 while also adding billions in new defense spending to face what Macron says are resurgent threats from Russia and beyond.",
      "Bayrou questioned the religious importance of Easter Monday. And Victory Day, celebrated on May 8, comes in a month that has become a \u201cveritable Gruyere,\u201d or holey cheese, of days off that includes May Day and the Catholic holiday of Ascension, he said.",
      "He said that those holidays were just suggestions, and that he was open to other ideas. France currently has 11 official holidays per year.",
      "With no parliamentary majority, Macron\u2019s centrist grouping must win support from adversaries on the left and right to pass the budget this fall. Bayrou's proposals, which are just a first step in the budget process, were quickly assailed by unions and the far-right National Rally, the largest single party in the lower house of Parliament.",
      "Bayrou\u2019s job is precarious, and he could be voted out if he fails to reach compromise on the budget.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Police fear Bradley John Murdoch, known as the \u201cOutback Killer\u201d, has taken to his grave the secret of how he disposed of the body of British backpacker Peter Falconio who was murdered in arid central Australia 24 years ago.",
      "Murdoch died Tuesday night, aged 67, in the palliative care unit of the Alice Springs Hospital, officials said Wednesday. He was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was recently transferred to the hospital from the Alice Springs prison.",
      "His death leaves the mystery of the whereabouts of Falconio\u2019s body unsolved.",
      "The Northern Territory Police Force said investigators remain \"committed to resolving this final piece of the investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio\u2019s remains,\" a police statement said. \u201cHis silence has denied the Falconio family the closure they have so long deserved.\"",
      "The victim's 83-year-old father, Luciano Falconio, was visibly shocked and lost for words after learning of Murdoch's death a day after the anniversary of his son's disappearance, News Corp Australia reported.",
      "\u201cI tell you what I think, I wish he (Murdoch) left something for me to find him,\u201d the father told the news company from his home in the U.K.",
      "In 2005, Murdoch was convicted of the 2001 murder of 28-year-old Falconio, from Huddersfield in England\u2019s Yorkshire region, and the attempted kidnapping of Falconio\u2019s girlfriend Joanne Lees.",
      "The crime captured global attention and was one of the inspirations for the 2005 Australian horror movie \u201cWolf Creek,\u201d about a serial killer who preyed on backpackers and left a single witness who became a suspect.",
      "Lees, who wrote about her ordeal in her 2006 memoir \u201cNo Turning Back,\u201d complained that police treated her as a suspect in the years before Murdoch was charged.",
      "A court order prevented the movie\u2019s release in the Northern Territory during Murdoch\u2019s trial, fearing it could influence jurors. Murdoch was not accused of any other killings.",
      "Murdoch consistently maintained his innocence and did not help authorities search for Falconio\u2019s remains.",
      "At the time of the killing, Murdoch was an interstate drug runner, using amphetamines to stay awake for dayslong drives and cannabis to sleep.",
      "On the night of July 14, 2001, he tricked Falconio and Lees into stopping their campervan on a dark and remote highway north of Alice Springs.",
      "Lees watched her boyfriend leave the van to inspect a supposedly sparking exhaust pipe. She testified that she heard a gunshot and never saw her boyfriend again.",
      "Murdoch, an imposing 193 centimeters (6 foot, 4 inches) in height, bound her wrists with cable ties before she managed to escape and hid in the desert scrub for hours. She testified she watched Murdoch searching for her with a flashlight and his dog.",
      "Lees later waved down a truck and raised the alarm.",
      "Last month, police doubled the reward for information leading to the location of Falconio\u2019s remains to 500,000 Australian dollars ($330,000), following news that Murdoch was in palliative care.",
      "\u201cPolice still hold out hope that someone may be able to provide some vital information to assist in this search,\u201d Police Commander Mark Grieve said.",
      "Colleen Gwynne, a former police officer who led the investigation at the time of Falconio's disappearance, said Murdoch might have panicked after Lees escaped and in his confusion forgot what he did with the body.",
      "\u201cOnce that panic set in \u2026 he may have disposed of a body somewhere he\u2019s not entirely certain where that is,\u201d Gwynne said earlier this month.",
      "Murdoch was sentenced to life in prison for Falconio\u2019s murder and was ordered to serve at least 28 years before he could be considered for parole. He was also sentenced to six years for assaulting Lees.",
      "The earliest he could have applied for parole would have been 2032, but without providing information as to what he had done with Falconio\u2019s body, Murdoch was not likely to have been released. The territory passed laws in 2016 preventing prisoners convicted of murder from qualifying for parole unless they provide police with the location of their victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "Murdoch was born in the west coast town of Geraldton, the third child of an automobile mechanic and his wife, a hairdresser.",
      "As a teen, he became involved in biker gang crime and was first sentenced to prison in 1995 for shooting at a group of Indigenous people at Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. He served 15 months of a 21-month sentence.",
      "In sentencing Murdoch for Falconio\u2019s killing, Chief Justice Brian Martin said he doubted any words could express the trauma and terror Lees had suffered.",
      "\u201cIt must have been close to the worst nightmare imaginable,\u201d the judge said.",

      "The U.K.\u2019s Air Safety Committee imposed the ban after Pakistan\u2019s aviation minister in June 2020 disclosed that nearly one-third of the country\u2019s pilots had cheated on their licensing exams. The claim came after a Pakistan International Airlines crash killed 97 people on May 24, 2020, in the southern city of Karachi.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement follows a broader international recognition of Pakistan\u2019s efforts to improve air safety. Earlier this year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency also lifted its five-year-long ban, allowing the national flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines to resume direct flights to Europe.",
      "British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said that after \u201cextensive engagement\u201d between the U.K.\u2019s Air Safety Committee and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, restrictions on Pakistani airlines have now been lifted. U.K. diplomatic missions in Commonwealth countries are known as high commissions and are equivalent to embassies.",
      "However, Marriott said individual airlines will still need to apply for operating permits from the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m grateful to aviation experts in both the U.K. and Pakistan for their collaborative work to meet international safety standards,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.\"",
      "The high commission emphasized that decisions on delisting countries or carriers from the U.K. Air Safety List are made through an independent safety process overseen by the Air Safety Committee.",
      "With more than 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the U.K., and thousands of British nationals residing in Pakistan, it said the move will help families to reconnect and potentially boost bilateral trade ties.",
      "Pakistan\u2019s Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif welcomed the decision.",
      "Speaking at a televised news conference on Wednesday, he attributed the ban to what he described as \u201cbaseless\u201d remarks made by former aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan. He said Khan\u2019s claim tarnished the country\u2019s image and triggered significant financial losses for Pakistan International Airlines.",

      "The latest bombardment in Russia\u2019s escalating aerial campaign against civilian areas came ahead of a Sept. 2 deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump for the Kremlin to reach a peace deal in the three-year war, under the threat of possible severe Washington sanctions if it doesn\u2019t.",
      "No date has yet been publicly set for a possible third round of direct peace talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine. Two previous rounds delivered no progress apart from prisoner swaps.",
      "Russia launched 400 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as one ballistic missile, during the night, the Ukrainian air force said. The strikes targeted northeastern Kharkiv, which is Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown of Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine, Vinnytsia in the west and Odesa in the south.",

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has unveiled a proposal for a long-term EU budget that she says will total $2.3 trillion",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union needs a new budget that would allow it to respond to crises like Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine or climate change, fund railways and energy grids, and protect farmers\u2019 livelihoods, the EU chief said Wednesday while unveiling her proposal totaling 2 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion).",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU\u2019s executive branch, said that under her budget plan, spending on defense and space would increase five-fold, while investment in migration and border management would triple.",
      "The proposal kicks off two years of wrangling between the 27 member states which fund most of the budget and the European Parliament. The spending package \u2014 which runs from 2028 to 2034 \u2014 is seen as a statement about Europe\u2019s ambitions in the world.",
      "Von der Leyen described her plan for the budget \u2013 known as the Multiannual Financial Framework \u2013 as \u201cthe most ambitious ever proposed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is more strategic, more flexible, more transparent, and we are investing more in our capacity to respond and more in our independence,\u201d she told reporters in Brussels.",
      "But in an early sign of the troubles ahead, von der Leyen conceded that even within her own team of policy commissioners \u2014 which worked through the night to finalize the proposal \u2013 \u201cnot everyone was satisfied with the amount.\u201d",
      "EU lawmakers who will chaperone the commission\u2019s proposal through parliament over the next year and 2027, and who were briefed on it, said that the budget math doesn't \"add up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHowever you try to package this, what we have is a real-terms investment and spending freeze,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cIt is the status quo, which the Commission has always insisted is not an option.\u201d",
      "Part of the numbers confusion is due to von der Leyen's insistence that national contributions to the budget will not increase. Extra funds would be found through \u201ca step change\u201d in the way the commission raises its own money, she said.",
      "The EU as a bloc is not allowed to levy its own taxes, but it does earn revenue from things like customs duties and value added tax. The plan now is to get money through the carbon emissions trading system and a new tobacco duty, among other measures.",
      "At the same time, the EU must also pay off billions of euros in debt incurred by measures introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to help revive economies after the pandemic.",
      "As for security, von der Leyen said 100 billion euros ($116 billion) should be set aside to help Ukraine rebuild from the ravages of the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "\u201cWe are suggesting 100 billion euros ... to support recovery, resilience, and of course their path to the EU membership,\u201d she said.",
      "Outside the commission headquarters, as von der Leyen\u2019s team debated the plan, around 200 farmers gathered and threw boots at the building.",
      "\u201cEverybody is talking about security for Europe. Everybody is talking about a stronger Europe. Well ,let me tell you, you can\u2019t get stronger with an empty stomach,\u201d said Lode Ceyssens, head of the Belgian farmers trade union Boerenbond.",

      "France\u2019s approach \u201cmay be described as paternalistic and even neo-colonial. We cannot accept such disdain for our sovereignty from France,\" Carmelo Nvono-Nc\u00e1, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s agent, told The Hague-based court.",
      "Equatorial Guinea has asked the court for a series of urgent orders, known as provisional measures, to return the swanky mansion on one of Paris\u2019s most prestigious streets, Avenue Foch, and to prevent France from selling the building.",
      "Obiang was convicted in 2017, and given a three-year suspended sentence for embezzling millions of dollars in public money. French authorities seized money, luxury vehicles and the building, which boasts a hammam, a cinema and a night club.",
      "The 57-year-old has faced scrutiny for corruption in other countries as well. In 2021, he was sanctioned by the United Kingdom for misappropriating public funds, including spending $275,000 on the bejeweled glove that Michael Jackson wore on his \u201cBad\u201d tour. Switzerland and Brazil have also opened investigations into his finances.",
      "In 2020, the International Court of Justice ruled that the building was a private residence, not a diplomatic outpost, rejecting a claim from Equatorial Guinea that the seizure violated international law.",
      "Equatorial Guinea returned to The Hague in 2022, arguing the French government was obliged to return the assets based on a U.N. anti-corruption convention.",
      "Despite its oil and gas riches, Equatorial Guinea has a dramatic gap between its privileged ruling class and much of the impoverished population. The former Spanish colony is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Obiang\u2019s father Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.",

      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Tesla Inc. opened its first showroom in India on Tuesday, marking the electric vehicle maker\u2019s long-anticipated debut in the world\u2019s third-biggest automotive market.",
      "Located in the Bandra-Kurla Complex, an upscale business center in the financial capital Mumbai, the showroom will serve as Tesla\u2019s flagship retail and experience outlet as the company introduces its EV lineup to Indian customers.",
      "Tesla\u2019s entry to India comes after years of delays and policy friction, marking a pivotal expansion in a fast-growing consumer base while global sales are plunging and the company faces challenges in its two core markets, China and the U.S.",
      "Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply from April to June as boycotts over Elon Musk\u2019s political views continued keeping buyers away.",
      "For India, Tesla\u2019s entry signals rising investor confidence and strengthens its move towards clean mobility.",
      "The country\u2019s nascent electric vehicle market made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.",
      "Tesla will begin by importing and selling its popular Y model cars in India. The base price would be 6.78 million rupees ($79,089) for the long-range, rear-wheel drive vehicle, according to a presentation by the company during the showroom launch Tuesday.",
      "By comparison, the price tag is around $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit.",
      "The rear-wheel drive will sell for around 6 million rupees ($70,000) in India. Delivery is expected to start from the third quarter, Tesla officials said.",
      "Tesla's higher pricing is likely to make its cars unaffordable for most Indians .",
      "Tesla will compete mostly with German luxury carmakers such as BMW and Mercedes Benz Group AG, and not budget Indian players like Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. The luxury car market makes up just about 1% of total vehicle sales",
      "The debut by American EV giant, however, would bring in world class technology to the country, auto analyst Gaurav Vangaal said.",
      "\u201cWith deeper local investments, Tesla can accelerate India\u2019s EV ecosystem, drive innovation and support the government\u2019s goal of higher EV penetration,\u201d said Vangaal, an associate director with S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has wooed Tesla for years for its global brand value and to boost the country\u2019s clean energy endeavors.",
      "CEO Elon Musk invited Indians in April 2016 to preorder the upcoming Tesla Model 3. Several customers placed an order but the cars never arrived and the booking amount had to be refunded.",
      "Despite his earlier enthusiasm, in 2019 Musk expressed concern in a post on his social media platform X that import taxes could double prices of Tesla cars, making them \u201cunaffordable.\u201d",
      "Tesla pressed Indian authorities to cut import taxes on EVs, which were up to 100%, to be able to test the local market. New Delhi, however, wanted Tesla to set up manufacturing facilities so a comprehensive policy could benefit all the players in the sector.",
      "The dynamics changed after Modi and Musk met in the U.S. in February during a state visit by Modi.",
      "Barely a month later, India rolled out a new policy to woo the likes of Tesla, reducing import taxes to 15% from 70% to 100% for EVs priced cheaper than $35,000 as long the automaker committed to building a factory in the country within three years.",
      "Soon after, Musk announced he would visit India in April to meet Modi. It was widely expected he would unveil Tesla\u2019s plans to set up manufacturing facilities and commit billions of dollars in investments. But Musk cancelled the visit, citing \u201cvery heavy Tesla obligations,\u201d and travelled to China instead.",
      "Since then, Tesla has conveyed it does not have an immediate interest in manufacturing in India.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d to the U.S. if Tesla builds a factory in India to circumvent that country\u2019s tariffs. India and the U.S. are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement for greater market access and reducing tariffs on most goods, including automobiles.",
      "Besides bringing Tesla to India, Musk\u2019s India ambition has been to launch Starlink\u2019s commercial internet services. The plan got a boost recently after the company secured regulatory clearances.",
      "Starlink now needs to secure telecommunications airwaves from the government, which may take at least a couple of months, before the services are formally launched.",

      "The Hong Kong government has proposed new regulations for ride-hailing services like Uber",
      "HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong government on Tuesday unveiled proposals to regulate online ride-hailing services provided by tech companies like Uber, requiring platforms, cars and drivers to be licensed before hitting the road.",
      "In a document sent to the legislature, transport officials said those companies applying for a license would need to have business registration and an office in the city. They also said the platforms would have to fulfill certain conditions on operating experience, proof of financial capability and capital investment, in addition to ensuring the cars and drivers working for them already purchased the required insurance.",
      "Under the licensing plans, eligible drivers must have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. The drivers also need to pass a test and complete training.",
      "Officials plan to set a quota on the number of vehicles allowed to be run under the policy, adding that the cars cannot be over seven years old and have to pass an annual inspection.",
      "Currently, it is illegal for drivers of private vehicles to provide paid services to customers without a permit. Police have arrested some Uber drivers suspected of driving without a permit in the past and in 2018, more than two dozen drivers were fined.",
      "Uber, which started operating in Hong Kong in 2014, has faced multiple legal and regulatory challenges in its overseas expansion but remains popular in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, where many residents are frustrated with poor taxi services.",
      "Some taxi companies have long resisted online platforms like Uber, seeing them as a threat to their business.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said the legislative framework would need to ensure the co-existence of online ride-hailing services and traditional taxi services. Transport officials could first handle issues with consensus and set up the framework before focusing on other controversial technical problems, Lee said.",
      "\u201cI agree the problem is complicated but it should not be further delayed,\u201d he said.",
      "In the document, the government said it would consider charging the platforms fees to provide resources for supporting the taxi industry in improving its service quality. It also suggested the companies allow taxi drivers to offer services through their platforms.",
      "Officials aimed to propose the changes in the third quarter of the year to set out matters in principle first. They planned to suggest further legal amendments for other issues in the first half of 2026.",
      "Uber Hong Kong welcomed the regulatory framework in a statement, saying it was encouraged to see safety and service standards placed at the center of the proposals.",
      "\u201cWhile we commend this progress, we remain concerned about the proposed cap on the number of ridesharing vehicles. Artificial limits risk increasing wait times, raising prices for riders and restricting earning opportunities for drivers,\u201d it said.",
      "It said it looked forward to continuing dialogue with the government and other stakeholders.",

      "\u201cHe looked at me and picked that piece of paper of the program. He folded it and greeted me,\u201d Watira said. \u201cHe\u2019s just afraid of me simply because I am not afraid of him.\u201d",
      "Watira, who seeks a seat in Uganda's Parliament, remembered the recent event as a vivid example of the rampant fear of witchcraft as politicians seeking office try to outmaneuver each other in this east African country.",
      "In public, political contests often entail spectacles where rivals rent cars to mount raucous processions in the streets, offering cash and other inducements to voters. Behind the scenes, the struggle for victory can be intensely spiritual, with faith figuring in incidents ranging from ritual sacrifice to visits with traditional healers, according to Watira and others who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "Watira, a leader of a group uniting Uganda\u2019s Bamasaba people, said the incumbent legislator who refused to shake his hand may have worried that would somehow give Watira the upper hand or provoke misfortune. Watira said he wasn't surprised by the man\u2019s behavior.",
      "\u201cThe moment your mind is pushed to that level, everything which happens you will always be suspicious,\u201d he said, speaking of overcoming his own fear of witchcraft. \u201cYou will start imagining, and that is the biggest challenge in our society.\u201d",
      "Spiritual warfare among politicians is part of a wider struggle over faith in Uganda, where Christianity is the dominant religion. Many who regularly attend church also secretly visit traditional shrines for the occult service they believe can lead them to victory.",
      "The syncretism has long confounded church leaders who teach that Christianity is incompatible with any vestiges of traditional religion, which remains widely practiced across sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "In African politics, often marked by bitter feuds along class and ethnic lines, fear of witchcraft can prove explosive.",
      "In South Sudan, Vice President Riek Machar believes himself to be the left-handed man with gapped teeth prophesied by a tribal seer a century ago as the unifying leader of his nation. There's widespread belief that the superstition fuels Machar\u2019s quest for power in South Sudan, which has been wracked by war since independence in 2011 as Machar tried to remove President Salva Kiir.",
      "In Kenya, some of the anti-government protesters who gathered last month in the capital, Nairobi, said the disorientation they felt while nearing the presidential residence was likely an evil spell in favor of President William Ruto. He also faces criticism for building a church within the statehouse compound that some critics see as an ominous shrine.",
      "In Zambia, two men are on trial for allegedly practicing witchcraft and possessing charms intended to harm President Hakainde Hichilema. Hichilema himself once was accused of practicing witchcraft by his predecessor Michael Sata, who contended the charms from his home region were stronger.",
      "In Uganda's capital, Kampala, and other cities, some street poles are plastered with notices by people promising to magically catch thieves or regain lost lovers. Now, many also advertise authority to secure politicians\u2019 victory in elections set for January 2026.",
      "\u201cAcross all Ugandan communities there is a crazy reliance on the witch doctors, crazy reliance by politicians,\u201d said Steven Masiga, a researcher and cultural leader in the city of Mbale. \u201cWitch doctors now are reaping money from politicians. Now, as politicians mobilize money, there is a percentage for the witch doctor because the real hope is in the witch doctor.\u201d",
      "Many candidates feel that \u201cvoters can oscillate around but the witch doctors never let you down,\" he said.",
      "Masiga cited a politician in his area who years ago, urged on by a witch doctor, skinned a goat alive without slaughtering the animal. The witch doctor\u2019s client won the election.",
      "Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power for four decades and a candidate for reelection, has previously expressed his respect for African witch doctors, an often pejorative term referring to medicine men and women who prescribe herbs for ailments and others who claim to erase problems by magic. Some of these practitioners prefer to be described as traditional healers.",
      "In a speech last year, Museveni recalled jumping over a slaughtered chicken three times in the ritual he performed as the leader of the bush war that propelled him to power in 1986. Museveni said of traditional religion that \u201cit is very strong\u201d and urged mainstream religious leaders not to antagonize its practitioners.",
      "\u201cWe had a very good relationship with them,\u201d he said of traditional healers.",
      "Many Ugandan politicians are believed to retain the services of witch doctors, but they rarely admit it in public to avoid ridicule. Some national leaders have been seen entering witch doctors\u2019 shrines over the years, drawing criticism from church leaders who condemn such behavior.",
      "In 2016, parliamentary speaker Rebecca Kadaga was photographed entering a shrine associated with her clan in eastern Uganda. The Anglican archbishop issued a rebuke; Kadaga, who has since left the speakership, said she sought to inform her ancestors of her political success.",

      "In her shrine, an igloo-like structure whose small entrance forces clients to kneel or squat to get in, she demonstratefd her practice by shaking calabashes and tossing cowrie shells on the floor. A tobacco pipe is another tool of her trade; she blows smoke while divining the future.",
      "Mukite\u2019s career began in 1980 after being possessed by a spirit that she said she had to overcome to gain the spiritual authority she now claims. She offers her services for a small fee.",
      "\u201cI have many, many (clients),\" she said.",
      "She said she helps some politicians by administering a tree bark to chew, potentially saving them from calamities such as imprisonment. If her practices were unhelpful, she said, she wouldn\u2019t still be at work after so many years.",

The Chinese company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers said this week that it expects profit for the first six months of this year to jump by at least 350% compared with the prior-year period, largely because of its smash hit plush toy, the Labubu. Pop Mart joins a small list of companies that have tapped into the zeitgeist, drawing in millions of buyers who, for one reason or another, simply must get their hands on a toy or gadget of the moment.",
      "But what makes the Labubu a must-have, or any toy for that matter, is a decades-old question that toy makers have yet to figure out.",
      "Here's a look at some of the most popular toys over the years.",
      "Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores trying to get a hold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday.",

      "Beanie Babies captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs.",
      "Many people collected, traded and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder, Ty Warner, a billionaire in three years.",
      "In 2014 Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years' probation. Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion.",
      "Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s.",
      "Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining and playing with the critter on screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies.",
      "In 2013 Tamagotchi was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in May.",
      "Fidget spinners \u2014 the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles \u2014 were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn't made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Eleven than at big toy chains.",
      "Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media.",
      "While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China. The toys were marketed as a concentration aid but became so popular among children that many schools started banning them, saying that they were a distraction.",
      "The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015.",
      "In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn\u2019t until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out.",
      "Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart\u2019s plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company\u2019s annual report.",

      "The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its producer price index was unchanged last month from May after rising 0.3% the previous month. June wholesale prices rose 2.3% from a year earlier, the smallest year-over-year gain since September. Both measures came in below what economists had expected.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so called core producer prices were also unchanged from May and up 2.6% from June 2024.",
      "The report on wholesale inflation arrived a day after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices last month rose 2.7% from June 2024, the biggest year-over-year gain since February, as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs pushed up the cost of everything from groceries to appliances.",
      "Consumer prices and producers prices do not always move in tandem, however.",
      "Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, saw some signs of the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs in a 0.3% increase in core wholesale goods prices. Furniture prices rose 1% from May and home electronics 0.8%, he noted. Both of those types of goods are heavily imported.",
      "But producer prices at steel mills fell 5.5% despite Trump\u2019s hefty 50% tax on imported steel.",
      "Some companies bought products before Trump rolled out his tariffs and have relied on those inventories to keep a lid on prices. But Saunders warned that those inventories are running low and that Trump plans to impose stiff tariffs (such as 25% levies on Japanese and South Korean imports) starting Aug. 1.",
      "\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet,\u2019\u2019 Saunders wrote in a commentary.",
      "The producer price report showed that auto retailers' profit margins dropped 5.4%, suggesting that car dealers were eating the cost of Trump's 25% tariff on some imported cars and auto parts. That might explain why new vehicle prices fell last month in the consumer price report Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe doubt that auto retailers will continue to absorb the tariffs indefinitely,'' wrote Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \u201dbut they have room to fall a good deal further after they surged during the spike in sales as people sought to get ahead of tariffs on imported vehicles.''",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also monitor the report closely because some of its components, notably measures of health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation began to flare up for the first time in decades in 2021, as the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. That prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs helped bring inflation down from the peaks it reached in 2022, and last year the Fed felt comfortable enough with the progress to cut rates three times.",
      "But it has turned cautious this year while it waits to see the inflationary impact of Trump\u2019s trade policies. Trump has aggressively stepped up pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which has been seen as a threat to the central bank\u2019s independence.",

      "UK inflation has risen to a near 18-month high in June as food prices surged for the third month running",
      "LONDON -- UK inflation rose to a near 18-month high in June as food prices surged for the third month running, official figures showed Wednesday. Economists said the unexpected increase could prompt the Bank of England to lower interest rates slower than currently anticipated.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 3.6% in June, up from 3.4% in May. That was the highest rate since January 2024.",
      "The statistics agency said higher food prices was largely behind the increase. Fuel and transport costs also contributed.",
      "Though inflation remains way above the Bank of England's target rate of 2%, most economists think the central bank will opt to cut interest rates again at its next meeting on Aug. 7 as sluggish economic growth is anticipated to weigh on prices over the coming year or two.",
      "Since its first quarter-point rate cut last August from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the Bank of England has played it steady, reducing interest rates every three months to the current 4.25%.",
      "However, some economists believe the higher inflation rate may cause some jitters among rate-setters, which could see the bank delay further reductions.",
      "\u201cWhile June\u2019s hot inflation won\u2019t deter policymakers from sanctioning an August policy loosening, given mounting worries over economic conditions, these figures may increase caution over the pace of future rate cuts,\u201d said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.",

    "story": [
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid and Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two strong choices for those willing to sacrifice some interior space, especially in the third row, for exceptional fuel economy and a lower price",
      "The 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid and 2025 Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two three-row SUVs with compelling attributes if you\u2019re shopping for a family-oriented vehicle. First, they\u2019re both hybrids and get excellent fuel economy. They\u2019re also smaller and less expensive than many other three-row SUVs, such as the Kia Telluride and Toyota Grand Highlander. Not everyone needs a giant vehicle with a third-row seat that can fit full-size adults \u2014 something for occasional use by bigger kids or teens can easily suffice.",
      "If any or all of that sounds like what you\u2019re looking for, the Sorento and Highlander hybrids should fit the bill. But which one should you buy? Edmunds\u2019 car experts have tested both to find out.",
      "We\u2019ve already indicated that the Sorento and Highlander have less third-row legroom than bigger three-row SUVs. They also have less cargo space when you raise their third-row seats. Of these two vehicles, the Highlander is bigger on the outside, although that doesn\u2019t entirely translate to a bigger interior. It\u2019s wider and comes standard with seating for six people. You can get a Highlander Hybrid with an optional second-row bench seat that increases capacity to seven.",
      "The Sorento Hybrid only comes with second-row captain\u2019s chairs and, as a result, it has a maximum six-passenger capacity. The Highlander can also fit slightly more stuff behind its third row \u2014 think an extra duffel or big grocery bag \u2014 and its advantage increases with each row lowered.",
      "On the other hand, the Sorento has slightly more third-row legroom and headroom. That\u2019s relative since only small people can fit in the way back of each. Indeed, the Highlander\u2019s advantage isn\u2019t that significant, and the Sorento\u2019s smaller exterior size is a benefit in terms of parking and maneuverability \u2014 two reasons one can contemplate this smaller three-row subset to begin with.",
      "Advantage: Toyota Highlander Hybrid",
      "The Sorento Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in combined city/highway driving in its standard front-wheel-drive configuration. Opting for all-wheel drive drops that slightly to 34 mpg combined. Every Highlander Hybrid has all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined. You can pretty much consider this a tie.",
      "Performance differs, however. At the Edmunds test track, an all-wheel-drive Sorento Hybrid accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, which is a respectable time for a three-row hybrid SUV. It feels quick, too, thanks to the ample torque provided by the turbocharged engine and electric motor. It also has a six-speed automatic transmission that shifts quickly and smoothly. Having front-wheel drive standard is also nice as it lowers the cost of entry for those who don\u2019t need the winter-ready traction of all-wheel drive.",
      "The Highlander Hybrid went from zero to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds, which is slower than non-hybrid SUVs by about a second. Power is readily available and smoothly delivered, but Toyota\u2019s more typical hybrid powertrain features a continuously variable automatic transmission that makes the engine drone under hard acceleration. That engine is also not turbocharged.",
      "Advantage: Kia Sorento Hybrid",
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid starts at $40,105, or about $8,000 less than the $48,315 Highlander Hybrid \u2014 adding all-wheel drive to the Kia only reduces the gap by $1,800. The Highlander does come with a few extra standard features to partially offset its higher price, but we don\u2019t think they fully justify the price premium. Moreover, the Highlander continues to be similarly more expensive when you compare each vehicle\u2019s more well-equipped trim levels.",
      "The Sorento also has a better infotainment system as standard, with a 10.25-inch touchscreen packing integrated navigation. The Highlander\u2019s standard unit is only 8 inches and lacks navigation. You can, however, add the 12.3-inch touchscreen that\u2019s standard on upper trims to the base trim as a stand-alone option. Feature content within the infotainment systems is comparable, but the Kia has multiple USB ports in each row whereas the Highlander has none in the third row. In terms of functionality, we score both the Toyota and Kia tech interfaces similarly strong in terms of usability.",
      "Safety technology content is similarly robust in both SUVs, but the Sorento\u2019s are superior in terms of performance, especially the adaptive cruise control system.",
      "Advantage: Kia",
      "The Sorento and Highlander hybrids are similar in concept, but our testing team ultimately scores the Kia higher. Moreover, the Toyota is so much more expensive regardless of trim level that it makes the Kia look like that much stronger of a choice.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he has finally found a way to achieve his goal of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation project.",
      "The push comes after a monthslong campaign by Trump to try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker, who has resisted the Republican president's calls to slash interest rates out of concerns about the administration's tariffs sparking higher levels of inflation.",
      "Trump indicated Tuesday that Powell\u2019s handling of an extensive renovation project on two Fed buildings in Washington could be grounds to take the unprecedented and possibly legally dubious step of firing him. \u201cI think it sort of is,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cWhen you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it\u2019s really disgraceful,\u201d Trump said, adding that he never saw the Fed chair as someone who needed a \u201cpalace.\u201d",
      "The project has been underway for years, going back to Trump\u2019s first term. But it only recently caught the White House\u2019s attention. Trump maintains Fed rate cuts would lower the costs of government borrowing, while Powell has warned a premature rate cut could worsen inflation and ultimately raise those borrowing costs.",
      "The risk of the Fed losing its political independence could undermine America\u2019s financial markets, possibly leading to a meltdown in stocks and investors charging a premium to lend to the U.S. economy.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "The Fed chair has been an obstacle in Trump's efforts to gain total control over the executive branch.",
      "Powell and his board have the dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping prices stable, a task that can require them to make politically unpopular moves such as raising interest rates to hold inflation in check. The general theory is that keeping the Fed free from the influence of the White House \u2014 other than for nominations of Fed officials \u2014 allows it to fulfill its mission based on what the economy needs, instead of what a politician wants.",
      "An attempt to remove Powell from his job before his term ends in May 2026 would undercut the Fed\u2019s long-standing independence from day-to-day politics and could lead to higher inflation, higher interest rates and a weaker economy.",
      "The Supreme Court recently signaled that Trump can\u2019t fire Powell simply because the president disagrees with him on interest rates. But legally he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or dereliction of duty.",
      "Trump's workaround appears to be that Powell misrepresented the renovation project in congressional testimony and that the cost is excessive, thus meriting his dismissal.",
      "The Fed says its main headquarters, known as the Marriner S. Eccles building, was in dire need of an upgrade because its electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems, among others, are nearly obsolete and some date back to the building's construction in the 1930s.",
      "The renovation will also remove asbestos, lead and other hazardous elements and update the building with modern electrical and communications systems. The H-shaped building, named after a former Fed chair in the 1930s and '40s, is located near some of Washington\u2019s highest-profile monuments and has references to classical architecture and marble in the facades and stonework. The central bank is also renovating a building next door that it acquired in 2018.",
      "The Fed says there has been periodic maintenance to the structures but adds this is the first \u201ccomprehensive renovation.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials have criticized the Fed over the project's expense, which has reached $2.5 billion, about $600 million more than was originally budgeted.",
      "Like a beleaguered homeowner facing spiraling costs for a remodeling project, the Fed cites many reasons for the greater expense. Construction costs, including for materials and labor, rose sharply during the inflation spike in 2021 and 2022. More asbestos needed to be removed than expected. Washington's local restrictions on building heights forced it to build underground, which is pricier.",
      "In 2024, the Fed's board canceled its planned renovations of a third building because of rising costs.",
      "The Fed says the renovations will reduce costs \u201cover time\u201d because it will be able to consolidate its roughly 3,000 Washington-based employees into fewer buildings and will no longer need to rent as much extra space as it does now.",
      "Russ Vought, the administration's top budget adviser, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d about the Fed's \u201costentatious overhaul\u201d of its facilities.",
      "The Fed's renovation plans call for \u201crooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more,\" Vought said in last week's letter.",
      "Powell has disputed the claims, which were given wide circulation in a paper issued by the Mercatus Center, a think tank at George Mason University, in March 2025. The paper was written by Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College and former Fed staffer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no VIP dining room,\" Powell said last month during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no new marble. ... There are no special elevators. There are no new water features. ... And there's no roof terrace gardens.\u201d",
      "Some of those elements were removed from initial building plans submitted in 2021, the Fed says.",
      "The Fed's changes to its building plans have opened it up to another line of attack: White House officials suggest the Fed violated the terms of the approval it received from a local planning commission by changing its plans.",
      "In its September 2021 approval of the project, the National Capital Planning Commission said it \u201cCommends\u201d the Fed for \u201cfully engaging partner federal agencies.\u201d But because the Fed changed its plans, the administration is indicating it needed to go back to the commission for a separate approval.",
      "Essentially, White House officials are saying Powell is being reckless with taxpayer money because of the cost of the renovation, but they are also accusing him of acting unethically by scaling back the project to save money.",
      "James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff whom Trump named to the commission, said in a post on X that Powell\u2019s June congressional testimony \"leads me to conclude the project is not in alignment with plans submitted to & approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.\u201d",
      "Speaking last Thursday at the planning commission meeting, Blair said he intends to tour the construction site, review materials from the Fed on how the approved 2021 renovation plans have changed and circulate a letter among his colleagues on the commission that would go to Fed officials.",
      "The central bank says, in a series of frequently asked questions on its website, that it is \"not subject to the direction\u201d of the commission and has only complied with its directives voluntarily.",
      "Instead, the Fed said it is accountable to the Senate and the House of Representatives and is overseen by an independent inspector general, not the White House. Powell has asked the inspector general to review the costs of the renovation project.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The United Kingdom, France and Germany have agreed to restore tough U.N. sanctions on Iran by the end of August if there has been no concrete progress on a nuclear deal, two European diplomats said Tuesday.",
      "The three countries' ambassadors to the United Nations met Tuesday at Germany\u2019s U.N. Mission to discuss a possible Iranian deal and reimposing the sanctions. The matter also came up in a phone call Monday between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the foreign ministers of the three countries, according to two U.S. officials.",
      "The State Department said after the call that the four had spoken about \u201censuring Iran does not develop or obtain a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "The officials and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The U.K., France and Germany are part of an agreement reached with Iran in 2015 to rein in its nuclear program, from which President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. during his first term, insisting it wasn\u2019t tough enough.",
      "Under the accord that lifted economic penalties on Iran in exchange for restrictions and monitoring of its nuclear program, a so-called \u201csnapback\u201d provision allows one of the Western parties to reimpose U.N. sanctions if Tehran does not comply with its requirements.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Tuesday that the three European countries would be justified in reapplying sanctions.",
      "\"With regard to Iran, the minister reiterated the priority of resuming negotiations to establish a long-term framework for Iran\u2019s nuclear program,'' the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. \u2018\u2019Without a verifiable commitment from Iran by the end of August at the latest, France, Germany and the U.K. will be justified in reapplying the UN sanctions (snapbacks) that were lifted 10 years ago.''",
      "The diplomats did not provide details of the deal being sought. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in recent days that Tehran would accept a resumption of nuclear talks with the U.S. if there were assurances of no more attacks, following Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities.",
      "He said there should be \u201ca firm guarantee that such actions will not be repeated, stressing that \u201cthe attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities has made it more difficult and complicated to achieve a solution.\"",
      "The United States and Iran held several rounds of negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program before the Israeli strikes began in June. Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week that talks would happen soon, but nothing has yet been scheduled.",
      "Araghchi, whose country insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, said in a July 2 CBS interview that \u201cthe doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\u201d",
      "Iran's U.N. Mission had no comment Tuesday on the threat of renewed sanctions if there is no deal.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said last week that the U.S. airstrikes so badly damaged his country\u2019s nuclear facilities that Iranian authorities still have not been able to access them to survey the destruction. Iran has suspended cooperation with the IAEA.",

      "Cuba\u2019s Labor Minister Marta Elena Feit\u00f3 Cabrera has resigned after controversial comments she made about poverty in the island nation",
      "HAVANA -- A Cuban minister who sparked criticism after saying that there are no beggars in Cuba, only people disguised as such, resigned Tuesday.",
      "Cuba's Presidency said in a post on X that Minister of Labor and Social Security Marta Elena Feit\u00f3 Cabrera \u201cacknowledged her errors and submitted her resignation.\u201d",
      "Feit\u00f3 made the comments Monday before deputies in a National Assembly committee. The comments went viral, prompting calls for Feit\u00f3's impeachment and a wave of criticism in a country experiencing a tough economic situation in recent years.",
      "Even Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel was critical. Without mentioning her by name, but referring to the meeting at the National Assembly committee where Feit\u00f3 participated, D\u00edaz-Canel said on his X account: \u201cthe lack of sensitivity in addressing vulnerability is highly questionable. The revolution cannot leave anyone behind; that is our motto, our militant responsibility.\u201d",
      "The economic crisis in Cuba has increased social vulnerability and led to unusual scenes for the island, such as people \u2014 especially the elderly \u2014 begging or scavenging through garbage, or some cleaning windshields at corners.",
      "\u201cWe have seen people, apparently beggars, (but) when you look at their hands, look at the clothes these people are wearing, they are disguised as beggars, they are not beggars,\" Feit\u00f3 said before the National Assembly committee. \"In Cuba there are no beggars.\u201d",
      "She added that people cleaning windshields use the money to \u201cdrink alcohol.\u201d",
      "Feit\u00f3 also lashed out against those who search through the garbage dumps, saying they are recovering materials \u201cto resell and not pay tax.\u201d",
      "Until a few years ago, despite the poverty, there were no signs of begging or homelessness on the island thanks to benefits that have now been greatly reduced.",
      "The pension of a retiree is about 2,000 Cuban pesos per month, roughly $5 on the informal market, and just under the cost of a carton of eggs. For those who don\u2019t receive remittances from family abroad, it means going hungry.",
      "Self-employed Enrique Guill\u00e9n believes the minister is wrong and that some people do not see the situation clearly, and hopes the government will take action.",
      "\u201cThey are elderly people who count on a pension that does not exist. They cannot even buy a carton of eggs. It is the reality we are living in Cuba,\u201d Guill\u00e9n said.",
      "On Monday, island authorities reported that Cuba's gross domestic product fell by 1.1% in 2024, accumulating a decline of 11% over the past five years.",

      "Senate Republicans have advanced President Donald Trump\u2019s request to cancel some $9 billion in previously approved spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Tuesday advanced President Donald Trump's request to cancel some $9 billion in previously approved spending, overcoming concerns from some lawmakers about what the rescissions could mean for impoverished people around the globe and for public radio and television stations in their home states.",
      "The Senate vote was 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.",
      "A final vote in the Senate could occur as early as Wednesday. The bill would then return to the House for another vote before it would go to Trump's desk for his signature before a Friday deadline.",
      "Republicans winnowed down the president's request by taking out his proposed $400 million cut to a program known as PEPFAR. That change increased the prospects for the bill's passage. The politically popular program is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush to combat HIV/AIDS.",
      "The president is also looking to claw back money for foreign aid programs targeted by his Department of Government Efficiency and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a $36 trillion debt, we have to do something to get spending under control,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Republicans met with Russ Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, during their weekly conference luncheon as the White House worked to address their concerns. He fielded about 20 questions from senators.",
      "The White House campaign to win over potential holdouts had some success. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., tweeted that he would vote to support the measure after working with the administration to \u201cfind Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.\u201d",
      "Some senators worried that the cuts to public media could decimate many of the 1,500 local radio and television stations around the country that rely on some federal funding to operate. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes more than 70% of its funding to those stations.",
      "Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was particularly concerned about a lack of specifics from the White House.",
      "\u201cThe rescissions package has a big problem \u2014 nobody really knows what program reductions are in it,\" Collins said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t because we haven\u2019t had time to review the bill. Instead, the problem is that OMB has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she didn't want the Senate to be going through numerous rounds of rescissions.",
      "\u201cWe are lawmakers. We should be legislating,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cWhat we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told: 'This is the priority and we want you to execute on it. We'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Collins and Murkowski joined with Democrats in voting against the Senate taking up the measure.",
      "McConnell said he wanted to make clear he didn't have any problem with reducing spending, but agreed with Collins that lawmakers didn't have enough details from the White House.",
      "\u201cThey would like a blank check is what they would like. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate,\" McConnell said.",
      "But the large majority of Republicans were supportive of Trump's request.",
      "\u201cThis bill is a first step in a long but necessary fight to put our nation\u2019s fiscal house in order,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.",
      "Democrats warned that it\u2019s absurd to expect them to work with Republicans on bipartisan spending measures if Republicans turn around a few months later and use their majority to cut the parts they don\u2019t like.",
      "\u201cIt shreds the appropriations process,\u201d said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats. \u201cThe Appropriations Committee, and indeed this body, becomes a rubber stamp for whatever the administration wants.\u201d",
      "Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that tens of millions of Americans rely on local public radio and television stations for local news, weather alerts and educational programs. He warned that many could lose access to that information because of the rescissions.",
      "\u201cAnd these cuts couldn't come at a worse time,\u201d Schumer said. \"The floods in Texas remind us that speedy alerts and up-to-the-minute forecasts can mean the difference between life and death.\u201d",
      "Democrats also scoffed at the GOP's stated motivation for taking up the bill. The amount of savings pales compared to the $3.4 trillion in projected deficits over the next decade that Republicans put in motion in passing Trump's big tax and spending cut bill two weeks ago.",
      "\u201cNow, Republicans are pretending they are concerned about the debt,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. \u201cSo concerned that they need to shut down local radio stations, so concerned they are going to cut off \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 ... The idea that that is about balancing the debt is laughable.\u201d",
      "With Republicans providing enough votes to take up the bill, it sets up the potential for 10 hours of debate plus votes on scores of potentially thorny amendments in what is known as a vote-a-rama. The House has already shown its support for the president\u2019s request with a mostly party line 214-212 vote, but since the Senate is amending the bill, it will have to go back to the House for another vote.",
      "Republicans who vote against the measure also face the prospect of incurring Trump's wrath. He has issued a warning on his social media site directly aimed at individual Senate Republicans who may be considering voting against the rescissions package. He said it was important that all Republicans adhere to the bill and in particular defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\u201cAny Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,\u201d he said.",

      "JPMorgan earned an adjusted $5.24 per share in the period, beating the $4.48 analysts were calling for but down from last year\u2019s $6.12 per share. Excluding the one-time items, JPMorgan earned $4.96 per share in the period.",
      "Dimon said the U.S. economy remained resilient in the second quarter, highlighting tax reform and the potential for more deregulation. However, he noted that plenty of risks remain, including trade uncertainty, geopolitical conflicts and federal government deficits.",
      "\u201cThe finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook, however, significant risks persist \u2014 including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices,\u201d Dimon said in prepared remarks.",
      "Dimon often weighs in on global and economic issues that go beyond the scope of banking. He\u2019s seen as the banker that Washington and global leaders can turn to for advice, solicited or unsolicited. His comments tend to reverberate through Washington and Corporate America.",

      "The country\u2019s biggest banks have benefitted from higher interest rates for the last two years, but many expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark lending rate up to two times this year, which will impact banks' bottom line.",
      "Total managed revenue hit $45.7 billion, also beating expectations but below last year\u2019s $51 billion. Wall Street was expecting revenue just under $44 billion.",
      "Shares of JPMorgan shifted between tiny gains and losses before the bell Tuesday, while broader U.S. markets were essentially flat.",
      "Wells Fargo also reported its second-quarter earnings early Tuesday, beating Wall Street's profit and revenue targets. Wells posted net income of $5.5 billion in the period. That works out to a profit of $1.60 per share, beating the $1.41 analysts expected and the $1.33 from the same quarter a year ago.",
      "However, investors were discouraged by the San Francisco bank's outlook, and its shares fell 2% in premarket trading.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he raised concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise near Australia",
      "BEIJING -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he complained to China's President Xi Jinping during a meeting on Tuesday about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise off the Australian coast that forced commercial aircraft to change course.",
      "The exercise, held in February, saw a Chinese flotilla partially circumnavigate Australia in international waters beneath a busy commercial flight path in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.",
      "The mission was widely regarded as a display of Chinese military strength and was among several issues raised in what Albanese described as a \u201cvery constructive meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Xi said that China engaged in exercises, just as Australia engages in exercises,\u201d Albanese told reporters, referring to freedom of navigation missions conducted by Australian military in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "\u201cThere was no breach of international law by China, but that we were concerned about the notice and the way that it happened, including the live-fire exercises,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Albanese said the Chinese leader did not mention U.S. pressure on allies to declare positions on a potential war over Taiwan.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed on Taiwan Australia's position of support for the status quo,\u201d Albanese said. Australia has a one-China policy that recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and considers Taiwan a part of China.",
      "With the 10th anniversary of Australia's free trade deal with China falling this year, both governments have agreed to review the pact with an aim to improve economic relations.",
      "Following the meeting with Xi, Albanese met Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People\u2019s Congress.",
      "At the outset of the leaders' meeting, Xi told Albanese that seeking common ground while setting aside differences is in line with \"the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples.\u201d",
      "Albanese concurred with Xi's remark, saying \u201cThat approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.\u201d",
      "There had been speculation that Xi would use the meeting to raise Albanese\u2019s plan to end a Chinese company\u2019s 99-year-lease on the strategically important Port of Darwin, which the United States is concerned could be used to spy on its military forces.",
      "Landbridge Industry Australia, a subsidiary of Rizhao-based Shandong Landbridge Group, signed the lease with the debt-laden Northern Territory government in 2015. That was three years after U.S. Marines began annual rotations through Darwin as part of the U.S. pivot to Asia.",
      "Chinese social media influencer Lu Wenxing had posted that China could retaliate against ending the lease with \u201ccountermeasures, such as restricting Australian companies\u2019 market access in China or tightening imports of key resources such as iron ore.\u201d",
      "But Albanese said Xi didn\u2019t raise the lease, nor did he discuss the broader issue of Australia\u2019s foreign investment rules that prevent Chinese ownership of critical infrastructure.",
      "Reporters questioned Albanese about Chinese security officials' treatment of Australian journalists who traveled to China with him.",
      "Reporter Stephen Dziedzic said he was with a camera crew on Tuesday recording a piece to camera for Australian TV news in front of a Beijing landmark when they were interrupted by security guards. The guard told them police would be called and the Australians weren't permitted to leave.",
      "Another reporter, Anna Henderson, said guards told journalists to delete their footage. Australian diplomats intervened and TV crews were permitted to leave.",
      "\u201cChina has a different system, obviously, with the media,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The state visit is Albanese's second visit to China since he was first elected prime minister in 2022.",
      "Australia, like many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is caught between China and the United States.

      "But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers.",
      "While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,\u201d said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States.",
      "The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades.",
      "It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently.",
      "That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center.",
      "\u201cWe just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,\u201d said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.\u201d",
      "Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock.",
      "They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said.",
      "As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out.",
      "Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed.",
      "\"Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,\u201d Finney said.",
      "Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason.",
      "It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board.",
      "Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected.",
      "\u201cDuring Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap.",
      "\u201cThere has been no federal funding for 911,\u201d Martin, of RapidSOS said. \u201cIt has been in various draft formats as long as I\u2019ve been doing this and it\u2019s never gotten through Congress.\u201d",
      "There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,\" Martin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.\u201d",

      "Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast",
      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast.",
      "Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% last month from a year ago, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May, according to data provider FactSet. The Labor Department will issue its inflation report at 8:30 a.m. eastern. On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% from May to June, the largest increase since January, economists project.",
      "Worsening inflation could pose a political challenge for President Donald Trump, who promised during last year's presidential campaign to immediately lower costs. The sharp inflation spike of 2022-2023 was the worst in four decades and soured most Americans on former president Joe Biden's handling of the economy.",
      "Faster price increases would also likely underscore the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut its short-term interest rate, as Trump is loudly demanding.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, inflation is forecast to have risen 3% in June from a year earlier, up from a 2.8% rise in May. On a monthly basis, it is also expected to have picked up 0.3% from May to June, according to FactSet. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Trump has imposed sweeping duties of 10% on all imports, plus 50% levies on steel and aluminum, 30% on goods from China, and 25% on imported cars. Just last week the president threatened to hit the European Union with a new 30% tariff starting Aug. 1.",
      "So far, the tariffs haven't noticeably pushed up inflation, which has been mild for the past four months. Core inflation has fallen from 3.3% in January to 2.8% in May, though that is still above the Fed's 2% target. If inflation in June is much weaker than economists forecast, Trump will likely renew his demands that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell immediately reduce borrowing costs.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized that they want to see how the economy evolves as the tariffs take effect before cutting their key short-term rate. The Fed chair has said that the duties could both push up prices and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the central bank since higher costs would typically lead the Fed to hike rates while a weaker economy often spurs it to reduce them.",
      "Trump on Monday said that Powell has been \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d The president added that the economy was doing well despite Powell\u2019s refusal to reduce rates, but it would be \u201cnice\u201d if there were rate cuts \u201cbecause people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.\u201d",
      "Last week, White House officials also attacked Powell for cost overruns on the years-long renovation of two Fed buildings, which are now slated to cost $2.5 billion, roughly one-third more than originally budgeted. While Trump legally can't fire Powell just because he disagrees with his interest rate decisions, the Supreme Court has signaled, he may be able to do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or mismanagement.",
      "While inflation was mild in May, there were already signs in last month's report that tariffs were starting to have some impact. The cost of furniture, appliances, toys, and tools rose, though those increases were offset by falling prices for airfares, hotels, and muted rises in rental costs.",
      "Some companies have said they have or plan to raise prices as a result of the tariffs, including Walmart, the world's largest retailer. Automaker Mitsubishi said last month that it was lifting prices by an average of 2.1% in response to the duties, and Nike has said it would implement \u201csurgical\u201d price hikes to offset tariff costs.",
      "But many companies have been able to postpone or avoid price increases, after building up their stockpiles of goods this spring to get ahead of the duties. Other companies may have refrained from lifting prices while they wait to see whether the U.S. is able to reach trade deals with other countries that lower the duties.",

      "A federal court in Miami began considering Monday whether Elon Musk's car company should share blame for the death of a stargazing university student after a runaway Tesla sent her flying 75 feet through the air and severely injured her boyfriend",
      "NEW YORK -- A rare trial against Elon Musk's car company began Monday in Miami where a jury will decide if it is partly to blame for the death of a stargazing university student after a runaway Tesla sent her flying 75 feet through the air and severely injured her boyfriend.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiff argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature called Autopilot should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing red lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at nearly 70 miles an hour in the April 2019 crash. Tesla lays the blame solely on the driver, who was reaching for a dropped cell phone.",
      "\u201cThe evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cInstead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cellphones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver.\u201d",
      "The driver, George McGee, was sued separately by the plaintiffs. That case was settled.",
      "A judgement against Tesla could be especially damaging as the company works to convince the public its self-driving technology is safe during a planned rollout of hundreds of thousands of Tesla robotaxis on U.S. roads by the end of next year. A jury trial is rare for the company, whose suits over crashes are often dismissed or settled, and this one is rarer yet because a judge recently ruled that the family of the stricken Naibel Benavides Leon can argue for punitive damages.",
      "The judge, Beth Bloom of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, issued a partial summary judgement last month, throwing out charges of defective manufacturing and negligent misrepresentation against Tesla. But she also ruled plaintiffs could argue other claims that would make the company liable and ask for punitive damages, which could prove costly.",
      "\u201cA reasonable jury could find that Tesla acted in reckless disregard of human life for the sake of developing their product and maximizing profit,\u201d Bloom said in a filing.",
      "The 2021 lawsuit alleges the driver relied on Autopilot to reduce speed or come to a stop when it detected objects in its way, including a parked Chevrolet Tahoe that Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, had gotten out of near Key West, Florida, to look up at the sky. The Tesla rammed the Tahoe at highway speeds, causing it to rotate and slam into Benavides, tossing her into a wooded area and killing her.",
      "In legal documents, Tesla denied nearly all of the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it expects that consumers will follow warnings in the vehicle and instructions in the owners\u2019 manual, as well as comply with driving laws. Tesla warns owners in manuals that its cars cannot drive themselves and they need to be ready to intervene at all times.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers argue that Tesla should have a geofenced its Autopilot so it only worked on the big roads it was designed for and drivers couldn\u2019t use it on smaller roads such as the rural one where Benavides was killed. They also say data and video evidence shows the Autopilot did detect the Tahoe but then failed to warn the driver as they claim it should have done.",
      "Tesla has since improved its driver-assistance and partial self-driving features, but still faces lawsuits and investigations over what critics say is a gap between its exaggerated depictions of how well they work and what they can actually do.",
      "Federal auto safety regulators recalled 2.3 million Teslas in 2023 for problems with Autopilot failing to sufficiently alert drivers if they weren\u2019t paying attention to the road. They then put Tesla under investigation last year for saying it fixed the problem though it was unclear it actually did that.",
      "Musk has also continued to make public comments suggesting Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d technology, a more advanced version of Autopilot, allows cars to drive themselves, despite warnings from regulators not to do so because it could lead to overreliance on the systems, crashes and deaths. That technology has been involved in three fatal crashes and is under investigation of its ability to see in low-visibility conditions such as sunlight glare or fog.",
      "Tesla is promising a much more robust self-driving technology to power its robotaxis with no one behind the wheel. A test run in Austin, Texas, of the taxis appears to have gone mostly well, though there are scattered problems, such as a case when one cab went down the opposing lane.",

      "Proponents said the import tax will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of the U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange.",
      "Robert Guenther, the trade group's executive vice president, said the duty was \u201can enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "But opponents said the import tax will make tomatoes more expensive for U.S. consumers. Mexican greenhouses specialize in vine-ripened tomatoes, while Florida tomatoes are typically grown in fields and picked green.",
      "\u201cAs an industry, we are saddened that American consumers will have to pay a tomato tax, or duty, for a reduced selection of the tomatoes they prefer, such as tomatoes on the vine, grape tomatoes, Romas, cocktail tomatoes and other specialty varieties,\u201d said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes.",
      "Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, said U.S. retail prices for tomatoes will likely rise around 8.5% with a 17% duty.",
      "Jacob Jensen, a trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy institute, said areas with a higher reliance on Mexican tomatoes could see price increases close to 10%, since it will be more difficult to replace that supply, while other parts of the U.S. could see price increases closer to 6%.",
      "The duty stems from a longstanding U.S. complaint about Mexico's tomato exports and is separate from the 30% base tariff on products made in Mexico and the European Union that President Donald Trump announced on Saturday.",
      "The Commerce Department said in late April that it was withdrawing from a deal it first reached with Mexico in 2019 to settle allegations the country was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping.",
      "As part of the deal, Mexico had to sell its tomatoes at a minimum price and abide by other rules. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides always reached an agreement that avoided duties.",
      "In announcing its withdrawal from the Tomato Suspension Agreement, the Commerce Department said it had been \u201cflooded with comments\u201d from U.S. tomato growers who wanted better protection from Mexican goods.",
      "\u201cMexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \u201cThis rule change is in line with President Trump\u2019s trade policies and approach with Mexico.\u201d",
      "But others, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association, had called on the Commerce Department to reach an agreement with Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had also urged the Commerce Department to leave the current tomato agreement in place.",
      "In a letter sent to Lutnick last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 30 other business groups said U.S. companies employ 50,000 workers and generate $8.3 billion in economic benefits moving tomatoes from Mexico into communities across the country.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that withdrawing from the agreement \u2013 at a time when the business community is already navigating significant trade uncertainty \u2013 could lead to retaliatory actions by our trading partners against other commodities and crops that could create further hardship for U.S. businesses and consumers,\u201d the letter said.",

    "story": [
      "The Indian government has proposed requiring the lowest temperature setting on all new air conditioners to be 20 Celsius, or 68 Fahrenheit",
      "BENGALURU, India -- India\u2019s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them.",
      "The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).",
      "Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.",
      "The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.",
      "Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.",
      "Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn't specific about timing.",
      "The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India's sweltering cities.",
      "\u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,\u201d said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. \u201cSometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it\u2019s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don\u2019t do this.\"",
      "Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India\u2019s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.",
      "Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.",
      "If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India\u2019s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India\u2019s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.",
      "Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use \u2014 one in the afternoon and another around midnight \u2014 driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.",
      "The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.",
      "Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.",
      "\u201cPeople used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,\u201d said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.",
      "New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople have gotten too comfortable,\u201d he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.",
      "Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.",
      "\u201cTightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,\u201d said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.",
      "Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country\u2019s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.",
      "Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn't be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.",
      "\u201cAlthough India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.",
      "\u201cAir conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,\u201d said Abhyankar.",

      "The search for those missing after Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The search for those missing after Yemen's Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for, the private security firms involved said Monday.",
      "The announcement came as satellite photos show long, trailing oil slicks from where the bulk carrier Eternity C sank, as well as another where the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas by the Iranian-backed Houthis took place.",
      "Both ships were attacked over a week ago by the rebels as part of their campaign targeting vessels over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that's upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which $1 trillion of goods usually passes a year.",
      "The private security firms Ambrey and Diaplous Group ran the search for those missing from the Eternity C, which had a three-man security team aboard but requested no escort from either the U.S. Navy or a European Union force in the region. The ship came under attack July 7 and faced hours of Houthi assaults by small arms and bomb-carrying drones before ultimately sinking in the Red Sea.",
      "The initial attack on the Eternity C came a day after the attack on the Magic Seas. Both ships were Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned vessels.",
      "Ten people were recovered alive from the attack, including eight Filipino crew members and a Greek and Indian from the vessel\u2019s security team, the EU's Operation Aspides said. At least four are presumed to have been killed in the attack, leaving 11 others missing, the EU mission has said.",
      "The Houthis claimed to have taken some mariners after the attack, but have offered no evidence of that. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen said it believed the rebels had \u201ckidnapped\u201d some of the crew.",
      "\u201cThe decision to end the search has been taken by the vessel\u2019s Owner reluctantly but it believes that, in all the circumstances, the priority must now be to get the 10 souls safely recovered alive ashore and to provide them with the urgent medical support they need at this difficult time,\u201d a statement by the security firms said. \u201cThe thoughts of all those involved in the rescue operation are with the families of those who remain missing.\u201d",
      "The attacks on the vessels also raised concerns about damage to the environment in the Red Sea, home to corals and wildlife that draws divers, tourists and scientists. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed Monday by The Associated Press show large, spreading oil slicks in the southern Red Sea where the vessels sank.",
      "Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, estimated the length of the slick from the Eternity C at some 80 kilometers (50 miles) and from the Magic Seas at some 65 kilometers (40 miles). He warned it could threatened wildlife reserves in nearby Eritrea in Africa and elsewhere.",
      "The oil comes from the ship's tanks and had been used for their own propulsion. Other shipping disasters have seen much of the slicks evaporate on their own, though they cause damage to the environment, too.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sank four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.",
      "The Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels.",
      "The Houthis' new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic that saw the Americans bomb three Iranian atomic sites.",

      "Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t agree on much, but they share a conviction that the government should help American manufacturers, one way or another.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers. Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.",
      "Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.",
      "The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.",
      "The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.",
      "\u201cThe past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,\u2019\u2019 said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we\u2019ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.\u2019\u2019",
      "Big economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.",
      "Government policy was meant to help.",
      "Biden\u2019s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom \u2013 investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 \u2013 that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.",
      "But the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden\u2019s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, \u201cmanufacturing production will continue to flatline.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cManufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.\u2019\u2019",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers \u2014 and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America \u2014 by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.",
      "In some ways, Trump\u2019s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But \u201cwhen you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,\u2019\u2019 Zuzick said. \u201cSo that\u2019s definitely a situation where it\u2019s beneficial.\u2019\u2019",
      "But American factories import and use foreign products, too \u2013 machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.",
      "Consider steel. Trump\u2019s tariffs don\u2019t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices \u2013 and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.",
      "In fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France \u2014 and pay Trump\u2019s tariff.",
      "Trump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.",
      "The flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: \u201cCustomers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,\u2019\u2019 a fabricated metal products company said.",
      "\u201cTariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,\u2019\u2019 added a computer and electronics firm. \u201cThe situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.\u2019\u2019",
      "Some may argue that things aren\u2019t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they\u2019ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.",
      "Factories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.",
      "Suddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off \u2013 and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 \u2014 the most since 1994 \u2014 and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.",
      "But in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.",
      "In the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,\u2019\u2019 said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers.",
      "Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products said that it will take time to see if Trump\u2019s tariffs succeed in bringing factories back to America.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that manufacturing doesn\u2019t turn on a dime,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt takes time to switch gears.\u2019\u2019",
      "Hagopian at Pilot Precision is hopeful that tax breaks in Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill will help American manufacturing regain momentum.",
      "\u201cThere may be light at the end of the tunnel that may not be a locomotive bearing down,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "For now, manufacturers are likely to delay big decisions on investing or bringing on new workers until they see where Trump\u2019s tariffs settle and what impact they have on the economy, said Ned Hill, professor emeritus in economic development at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cWith all this uncertainty about what the rest of the year is going to look like,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a hesitancy to hire people just to lay them off in the near future.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cEveryone,'' said Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products, \u201dis kind of just waiting for the new normal.\u2019\u2019",

      "\u201cYou get out here in a different wind and it can be, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t think I'd be here.'\u201d",
      "There is another element to this major that stands out from the U.S. Open and PGA Championship. Amid the nerves and the pressure of a major is the true joy of playing links golf.",
      "\u201cI feel like I'm learning more and more each time I come over here,\u201d said Scottie Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player who is in his fifth British Open. \"Each golf course is different, too. Irish links so far is quite a bit different than Scottish links. It's a bit greener over here. You have to play more shots in the air. ... There's a lot of different shots you have to play.",
      "\u201cIt's an interesting course,\" he said. \"And from what I've seen, it seems to be really fun to play and very fair.\u201d",
      "Fair is a loose word in these parts, with all of the humps and crazy bounces, with pot bunkers to be avoided on so many shots, with a hole like the par-3 16th known as \u201cCalamity Corner\u201d that lives up to the name by looks alone.",
      "McIlroy isn't sure he got a fair deal in 2019 when his opening tee shot went left, normally not a big deal except at Royal Portrush there is internal out of bounds, and McIlroy went just beyond the stakes, which sent him into a downward spiral \u2014 a quadruple bogey, a 79 and a short week.",
      "He did not return to the Portrush links in his native Northern Ireland until Monday morning, and then he was out playing all three days of practice.",
      "\u201cI have a real appreciation for how well bunkered it is off the tee,\u201d McIlroy said. \"It's like, \u2018OK, I can't hit 2-iron off the tee, but that brings this bunker into play. But then if I hit driver, it\u2019ll bring in this bunker.' So you have to take on the shot.",
      "\u201cSome courses that we go to in the Open rota, you can just take the bunkers out of play,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, there's always one bunker or another bunker in play. So I think off the tee, it provides a very, very good test.\u201d",
      "McIlroy was among those who felt refreshed when he finished the meat of the PGA Tour season \u2014 five signature events, The Players Championship, three majors, all in a span of three months \u2014 and arrived in the United Kingdom. The scenery, the temperature, the brand of golf, all of it felt so new, almost like he was starting a new season.",
      "Thomas felt the same way. There is a buzz in the heavy, seaside air off the North Atlantic, no matter how stiff the challenge and how much the weather changes.",
      "The forecast? It's generally been referred to as \u201cmixed,\u201d which in these parts tends to mean it changes without notice. The final day of practice was sunshine and breezy.",
      "Thomas was playing the 16th while his father showed video of them watching in the final round in 2019, wind and rain ripping so hard that umbrellas were useless.",
      "Thomas remembers standing on the 17th tee and calling over a rules official to ask if they were meant to be playing. He wanted to hit 3-wood off the tee, but it was 209 yards to the fairway and the wind was so strong he didn't think he could get there. So he went with driver, hit some 75 yards off line and made triple bogey.",
      "On his final day of practice, with sunshine and a helping wind, he hit a mini-driver that would have stopped near the front of the green on the 409-yard hole if it hadn't found a bunker.",
      "This is what he loves about links golf.",
      "\u201cNot only do the holes change, how easy or hard they are, your lines off the tee can change,\u201d he said \u201cYou have elevation. You're never writing \u2018uphill\u2019 or \u2018downhill\u2019 in the yardage book like you are at an Open Championship. You have a game plan, but you really can't until you're out there and whatever the weather is giving you.\"",
      "Thomas looked back on the 18th green before going to sign autographs for a group of children.",
      "\u201cIf I could only play one course the rest of my life it would be links,\u201d Thomas said. \"Because you could play the same course every day for a month and get something different.",
      "\u201cI love The Open. Every time I've played it, I love the tournament more and more,\u201d he said. \u201cI really want to have a chance to win the tournament and walk up the 18th hole. Seems like it would be the coolest thing in the world.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's links course at Turnberry has not been taken off the British Open rotation",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- President Donald Trump is not getting a British Open to the Turnberry course he owns in the near future, an issue the R&A's new chief executive said Wednesday was more about transportation than politics.",
      "Turnberry is regarded as the most beautiful of the links on the Open rotation, set along the Ayrshire coast in Scotland across from the Ailsa Craig. It last hosted the Open in 2009, before Trump bought the resort.",
      "Mark Darbon, who took over at the R&A this year from Martin Slumbers, said Turnberry had not been taken off the list of potential British Open sites, but transportation and other issues had to be addressed.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve been extremely clear on our position in respect of Turnberry. We love the golf course but we\u2019ve got some big logistical challenges there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the scale of their setup here and we\u2019ve got some work to do on the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure around Turnberry.\u201d",
      "Darbon said the R&A met with Eric Trump and other leaders of Trump Golf a few months ago and the talks had been constructive.",
      "\u201cI think they understand clearly where we\u2019re coming from. We talked through some of the challenges that we have so we\u2019ve got a good dialogue with them,\u201d he said.",
      "Slumbers had previously said the R&A would not be going to Turnberry until it was comfortable the topic would be about golf and not the owner.",
      "Turnberry has only hosted the British Open four times, first in 1977 with the famous \u201cDuel in the Sun\u201d when Tom Watson beat Jack Nicklaus. But the Open is getting bigger, and the roads are limited getting to Turnberry.",
      "There has been speculation Trump, whose golf courses have never hosted a men's major, might ask the British government to intercede in getting the Open back to Turnberry.",
      "\u201cWe have an ongoing dialogue with the UK government given that we\u2019re a major event that creates significant value into the UK economy,\u201d Darbon said. \"We've spoken to them specifically about Turnberry and I think they\u2019ve made it clear that the decision around where we take our championship rests with us.",
      "\u201cI would find it difficult to predict whether there will be any discussion on The Open if the President is making a visit here.\u201d",
      "Turnberry is not the only Scottish links being ignored by the R&A. Muirfield, located along the Firth of Forth east of Edinburgh, is reputed to be the purest of links courses. Its first Open was in 1892, and there have been 15 others, most recently in 2013 won by Phil Mickelson.",
      "Only St. Andrews has hosted more Opens than Muirfield.",
      "But it has not been back there since 2013 as the R&A has been geared toward taking golf's oldest championship to courses that can hold big crowds. It is expected 278,000 spectators will be at Royal Portrush this week, the second-largest behind St. Andrews. The last Open at Muirfield had 142,000 spectators.",
      "The Open will be at Royal Birkdale next year, and then St. Andrews in 2027. The site for 2028 has not been announced. Muirfield has never gone more than 11 years \u2014 except for interruptions from World War I and World War II \u2014 between Opens.",
      "\u201cWe love the golf course at Muirfield. We\u2019re in a discussion with the venue right now,\u201d Darbon said. \"There\u2019s some things that we need to evolve at Muirfield \u2014 the practice ground in particular is a challenge for us with a modern Open and there\u2019s some work we need to do with the venue to facilitate some of the infrastructure that we require.",

      "Financial specifics were not disclosed, but the deal is one of the more significant in USABS history.",

      "Oakmont is banning former U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark from returning to the club until he pays for damaging his locker",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Former U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark won't be allowed back at Oakmont Country Club until he pays to fix the locker he damaged and gets counseling for his anger.",
      "Golf Digest obtained a letter that club president John Lynch sent to Oakmont members this week about the incident during last month's U.S. Open, when Clark smashed up his locker out of frustration. Media were not allowed in the locker room, but a photo was leaked and went viral.",
      "\u201cFollowing multiple discussions with the USGA and the OCC Board, a decision has been made that Mr. Clark will no longer be permitted on OCC property,\u201d Lynch said in the letter.",
      "\u201cReinstatement would be contingent upon Mr. Clark fulfilling a number of specific conditions, including full repayment for damages, a meaningful contribution to a charity of the Board\u2019s choosing, and the successful completion of counseling and/or anger management sessions.\u201d",
      "Clark received a 10-year exemption for winning the U.S. Open at Los Angeles Country Club in 2023. The exemption ends in 2033, the next time Oakmont is to host the U.S. Open. The storied club has held the U.S. Open nine times, the most of any U.S. Open site.",
      "Clark said a week later at the Travelers Championship that \u201cI made a mistake that I deeply regret\u201d and he was sorry.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019d also like to move on, not only for myself but for Oakmont, for the USGA, and kind of focus on the rest of this year and things that come up,\u201d he said.",
      "Last week at the Scottish Open he told reporters that he had turned the page. According to Oakmont, he has offered to pay for repairs.",
      "\u201cYeah, I mean, I made a mistake in a moment of rage with a bad year and everything coming together and it just was more than anything a good wake-up call for me to say, \u2018Hey, you know what, let\u2019s get back on track and things aren\u2019t that bad,\u2019\u201d Clark said.",
      "Clark, who reached as high as No. 3 in the world last year, has only one top 10 on the PGA Tour in the 2025 season. He has dropped to No. 28 in the world, No. 22 in the Ryder Cup standings and at No. 78 in the FedEx Cup is in danger of missing the postseason.",

      "Soccer faces growing challenges from extreme heat, as seen during the FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S. this summer",
      "GENEVA -- Soccer had a fierce reckoning with heat at the recently concluded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States \u2014 a sweltering preview of what players and fans may face when the U.S. co-hosts the World Cup with Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "With temperatures rising worldwide, scientists warn that staging the World Cup and other soccer tournaments in the Northern Hemisphere summer is getting increasingly dangerous for both players and spectators. Some suggest that FIFA may have to consider adjusting the soccer calendar to reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe deeper we go in the decade, the greater the risk without considering more dramatic measures, such as playing in the winter months and/or cooler latitudes,\u201d said Prof. Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures in Leeds, England. \u201cI\u2019m getting increasingly worried that we are only one heatwave away from a sporting tragedy and I would like to see governing bodies lean into the climate and health science.\u201d",
      "Tournament soccer in June and July is a tradition going back to the first World Cup in 1930.",
      "Since then, the three-month period of June, July and August globally has warmed by 1.05 degrees Celsius (1.89 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Meanwhile, European summer temperatures have increased by 1.81 degrees C. The rate of warming has accelerated since the 1990's.",
      "Climate scientists say that\u2019s a factor that needs to be considered when playing high-intensity outdoor sports like soccer.",
      "\u201cIf you want to play football for 10 hours a day, they\u2019ll have to be the hours of the early morning and late evening,\u201d climatologist Friederike Otto from Imperial College, London, told The Associated Press in an email, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to have players and fans die from heatstroke or get severely ill with heat exhaustion.\u201d",
      "Extreme heat and thunderstorms made an impact on FIFA's newly expanded tournament for club teams. The Club World Cup was held in 11 American cities from June 14 to July 13.",
      "FIFA adapted by tweaking its extreme heat protocol to include extra breaks in play, more field-side water, and cooling the team benches with air fans and more shade.",
      "Still, Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez said the heat made him dizzy and urged FIFA to avoid afternoon kickoffs at the World Cup next year.",
      "The global soccer players union, FIFPRO, has warned that six of the 16 World Cup cities next year are at \u201cextremely high risk\u201d for heat stress.",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino addressed the heat concerns on Saturday, saying the handful of World Cup stadiums that are covered would be used for day-time games next year.",
      "Extreme heat could become an even bigger challenge at the following World Cup in 2030, which will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco. Games are scheduled to be played in afternoons and early evenings from mid-June to mid-July. All three countries have already seen temperatures rise above 40 degrees C (well above 100 Fahrenheit) this summer.",
      "FIFA downplayed the heat risk in its in-house evaluation of the 2030 World Cup bid, saying \u201cweather conditions are difficult to predict with the current development in global and local climate, but are unlikely to affect the health of players or other participants.\u201d",
      "The physical effects of playing 90 minutes of soccer in direct sunshine during the hottest part of the day can be severe and potentially result in hyperthermia \u2013 abnormally high body temperatures.",
      "\u201cWhen players experience hyperthermia, they also experience an increase in cardiovascular strain,\u201d said Julien P\u00e9riard of the University of Canberra.",
      "\u201cIf core temperature increases excessively, exertional heat illness can occur,\u201d leading to muscle cramping, heat exhaustion, and even life-threatening heat stroke, he said.",
      "Many sports events held in the summer adjust their start times to early morning or late night to minimize the risk heat-related illness, including marathons at the Olympics  or track world championships. Morning kickoffs, however, are rare in soccer, where World Cup match schedules are often set with European TV audiences in mind.",
      "It would be hard for FIFA to avoid day-time World Cup kickoffs given the packed match schedule as the number of participating teams increases from 32 to 48 in 2026.",
      "Heat mainly becomes an issue when the World Cup is held in the Northern Hemisphere, because June and July are winter months in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "FIFA has stuck to its traditional June-July schedule for the men\u2019s World Cup except in 2022 when it moved the tournament to November-December to avoid the summer heat in Qatar. Something similar is expected when neighboring Saudi Arabia hosts the tournament in 2034.",
      "However, moving the World Cup to another part of the year is complicated because it means Europe\u2019s powerful soccer leagues must interrupt their season, affecting both domestic leagues and the Champions League.",
      "FIFA didn\u2019t respond to questions from AP about whether alternate dates for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups were being considered.",
      "When and where to schedule the World Cup and other outdoor sports events is likely to become more pressing as the world continues to warm.",
      "Athletes and even everyday people doing basic physical activities are now exposed to 28% more of moderate or higher heat risk in 2023 than they were in the 1990s, said Ollie Jay, a professor at the University of Sydney who has helped shape policy for the Australian Open in tennis.",
      "\u201cThis is symbolic of something bigger,\u201d said Michael Mann, a University of Pennsylvania climate scientist. \u201cNot just the danger and inconvenience to fans and players, but the fundamentally disruptive nature of climate change when it comes our current way of life.\u201d",

      "The NBA may finally be one step closer on the long road to expansion",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The NBA may finally be one step closer on the long road to expansion.",
      "Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday that the league has been tasked by team owners to study the issue more formally as part of in-depth analysis, which would be the first official move in a long process toward adding franchises.",
      "There's no timetable about how long the process will take, nor have any decisions been made on what the expansion fee will be, when the new teams will start play \u2014 or even if expansion is going to actually happen.",
      "The league isn't creating a new committee to study expansion; the duties, for now, will fall primarily to a pair of existing groups, with the advisory finance committee leading and the audit and strategy committee also involved.",
      "\u201cA lot of analysis still needs to be done and nothing has been predetermined,\u201d Silver said.",
      "The decision to take a harder look at expansion wasn\u2019t totally unexpected, since the notion of adding clubs has been a talking point for several years. Cities like Las Vegas and Seattle \u2014 long perceived to be the front-runners should the NBA decide to expand past its current 30-team footprint \u2014 will surely continue to push to be the eventual picks. And Silver himself has said previously that he expects expansion will happen at some point.",
      "\u201cI think there is a significant step now in that we are now engaging in this in-depth analysis, something we weren\u2019t prepared to do before,\" Silver said. \"But beyond that, it\u2019s really Day 1 of that in-depth analysis. And so, in terms of price, potential timing, it\u2019s too early to say. ... It is truly a complicated issue.\u201d",
      "The next board of governors meeting will likely take place sometime in September.",
      "Expansion has long been a difficult issue, since it\u2019ll mean, among other things, that the current owners will have decided to sell equity in a league that is on a financial roll right now.",
      "\u201cFor every team you add, you're diluting the economics of the current league,\u201d Silver said.",
      "A new series of media rights deals worth $76 billion kicks in for this coming season, franchise values across the league have soared and the two most title-laden franchises in the NBA, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, clubs that have combined for about half of the titles handed out in league history, are in the process of being sold with a combined valuation of at least $16.1 billion.",
      "The Celtics are being sold to private equity mogul Bill Chisholm with a valuation of at least $6.1 billion, which was a record until the Buss family agreed to sell the Lakers to businessman Mark Walter \u2014 also the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 with a valuation of $10 billion.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that those purchase prices have an impact on any economic analysis of teams, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily complicate it more, but it certainly is an indication of value,\" Silver said. \u201cAnd one other factor we have to look at: we\u2019re trying to think what is the value of expansion, what does it mean to dilute the existing equity, and how additive is this potentially to the league by adding an additional team.\u201d",
      "The league has added seven franchises since 1988, but none since 2004. There has been several instances of rebranding and relocating since \u2014 most notably, the Seattle SuperSonics moving to Oklahoma City in 2008 and becoming the Thunder \u2014 but the league has been at 30 teams for the past two decades.",

      "Local media in India reported that Singh sustained severe head injuries in a hit-and-run accident on Monday while he was crossing the road at his native village near Jalandhar in Punjab. He was taken to the hospital where he later died. His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs In The City, confirmed his death.",

      "Singh became the oldest man to run a full marathon in 2011 at the age of 100 in Toronto. His accomplishment was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he did not have a birth certificate to prove his age. Singh had a British passport that showed his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials stated that birth records were not kept in 1911.",
      "A torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Singh took up running at the age of 89 as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on him because of its grisly nature.",
      "Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father\u2019s eyes.",
      "Singh, whose five other children had emigrated, was left all alone.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t think his life was worth living without his son\u201d following the traumatic incident, his coach Harmander Singh said.",
      "He went to live with his youngest son in London. That\u2019s where sports enthusiast Singh attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community and took part in sprints. He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. One day he saw a marathon on television for the first time and decided that\u2019s what he wanted to do.",
      "At the age of 89 in 2000 he ran the London Marathon, his first, and went on to do eight more. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto Marathon.",
      "\u201cFrom a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,\u201d Singh said.",
      "Singh ran his last competitive race in 2013 at the age of 101, finishing the Hong Kong Marathon\u2019s 10-kilometer (6.25-mile) race in 1 hour, 32 minutes, 28 seconds.",
      "Following his retirement from racing, he said he hoped \u201cpeople will remember me and not forget me.\u201d He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events \u201crather than forget me altogether just because I don\u2019t run anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was an exceptional athlete with incredible determination,\u201d Modi said. \u201cPained by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and countless admirers around the world.\u201d",

      "Major League Baseball is testing automated ball-strike systems in the All-Star Game for the first time",
      "ATLANTA -- Tarik Skubal views the strike zone differently than robot umpires.",
      "\u201cI have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,\u201d Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful.",
      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

      "The new College Sports Commission sent a letter to athletic directors last week saying it was rejecting deals in which players were receiving money from collectives that were created solely to pay them and don't provide goods or services to the general public for profit.",
      "A lead attorney for the players responded by saying those instructions went against settlement terms and asking the CSC to rescind the guidance.",
      "\u201cThis process is undermined when the CSC goes off the reservation and issues directions to the schools that are not consistent with the Settlement Agreement terms,\u201d attorney Jeffrey Kessler wrote to NCAA outside counsel Rakesh Kilaru in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Yahoo Sports first reported details of the letter, in which Kessler threatens to take the issue to a judge assigned with resolving disputes involved in the settlement.",
      "Kessler told the AP that his firm was not commenting on the contents of the letter, and Kilaru did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment.",
      "Yahoo quoted a CSC spokesman as saying the parties are working to resolve differences and that \"the guidance issued by the College Sports Commission ... is entirely consistent with the House settlement and the rules that have been agreed upon with class counsel.\u201d",
      "When NIL payments became allowed in 2021, boosters formed so-called collectives that were closely tied to universities to work out contracts with the players, who still weren't allowed to be paid directly by the schools.",
      "Terms of the House settlement allow schools to make the payments now but keep the idea of outside payments from collectives, which have to be approved by the CSC if they are worth $600 or more.",
      "The CSC, in its letter last week, explained that if a collective reaches a deal, for instance, for an athlete to appear on behalf of the collective, which charges an admission fee, that collective does not have a \u201cvalid business purpose\u201d because the purpose of the event is to raise money to pay athletes, not to provide goods or services available to the general public for profit.",
      "Another example of a disallowed deal was one an athlete makes to sell merchandise to raise money to pay that player because, the CSC guidance said, the purpose of \u201cselling merchandise is to raise money to pay that student-athlete and potentially other student-athletes at a particular school or schools, which is not a valid business purpose.\"",
      "Kessler's letter notes that the \u201cvalid business purpose\u201d rule was designed to ensure athletes were not simply being paid to play, and did not prohibit NIL collectives from paying athletes for the type of deals described above.",
      "To prevent those payments \u201cwould be to create a new prohibition on payments by a NIL collective that is not provided for or contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, causing injury to the class members who should be free to receive those payments,\" Kessler wrote.",

      "Curveballs are disappearing from Major League Baseball as pitchers prioritize velocity, emphasizing sliders and sweepers",
      "ATLANTA -- Curveballs have been thrown a curve by a modern game valuing velocity over variety, disappearing from the major leagues by more than 20,000 annually.",
      "The Athletics have thrown curves on just 2.5% of pitches this season. The overall big league figure dropped from 10.7% in 2019 to 8.1% last year, the lowest since MLB starting tracking in 2008, before rising slightly to 8.5% this season.",
      "There were 22,962 fewer curveballs in 2024 than five years earlier.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really see a lot of people throwing 12-6 curveballs anymore,\u201d Tampa Bay pitcher Shane Baz said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather have a hard cutter/slider. It\u2019s a lot easier for guys to throw a sweeper than it is a 12-6 curveball.\u201d",
      "Baz\u2019s 28.1% is seventh in curveball use among those who have thrown at least 1,000 pitches this season.",
      "Baltimore\u2019s Charlie Morton, first at 39%, learned to throw a hook from his dad.",
      "\u201cHe was reading some article or maybe he was reading some pitching book,\u201d Baltimore\u2019s 41-year-old right-hander said. \u201cYou basically throw it like you\u2019re re-throwing a knife.\u201d",
      "Hall of Famer Candy Cummings, a 145-game winner, is credited with inventing the curveball in 1863 when he was 14, discovering the movement when he threw sea shells into the Atlantic Ocean. Some attribute the curve to amateur pitcher Fred Goldsmith in 1870.",
      "With an average velocity of 80.2 mph, curves are the slowest and loopiest of breaking pitches, often disrupting the timing of batters set for smoke. The phrase \u201cthrown a curveball\u201d has become part of the English language, much like \u201cscrewball,\" more a phrase than a pitch these days.",
      "Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan and Clayton Kershaw were among the consummate curveballers, bamboozling batters as balls they gave up on dropped like hang gliders into the strike zone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become an industry of throwing over pitching,\u201d New York Yankees senior adviser Omar Minaya said. \u201cWhen you pitch, you use different pitches. What we\u2019re seeing in the industry as a whole, especially with showcases, is people are looking more at velocity than pitchability \u2014 as a scout, I said that unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Former pitcher Dallas Braden, now a broadcaster, longs for those days of deception.",
      "\u201cYou almost sympathize with the hitter in the moment because you\u2019re like: Damn, I couldn\u2019t have hit that. He couldn\u2019t hit that. Nobody could have hit that,\u201d Braden said. \u201cThe eephus is now almost like as close as we get, when a position player is on the mound, to an aesthetically pleasing pitch like that, just the visual presentation of the pitch starting in the clouds and ending up at the ankles.\u201d",
      "Nike\u2019s \u201cChicks Dig the Long Ball\u201d commercial defined baseball in the Steroids Era. These days the slogan might as well be: \u201cVelo Rules!\u201d There were just 214 pitches of 100 mph or more in 2008. There were a record 3,880 two years ago and this year is on track for 3,252.",
      "In tandem, starting pitcher use has dropped. Starters have averaged just under 5 1/3 innings this season, down from 6 1/3 innings in the 1980s. Their pitch count averages 85.7, down from 97 in 2010",
      "Average four-seam fastball velocity is a record 94.4 mph this season, up from 91.9 mph when MLB started tracking in 2008. But fastballs \u2014 four-seam, two-seam and cutters, have dropped from 62.1% to 55%.",
      "Those missing hooks and heaters have been replaced by sliders, sweepers and slurves. They are 22.6% of pitches this year, up from 13.9% in 2008, and their average velocity has risen to 84.8 mph from 83.4 mph.",
      "Colorado throws curves the most often at 15.6%, not that it has brought any success to a team that entered the break at 22-74, on track for a 37-125 finish and the post-1900 record for losses.",
      "The Athletics haven\u2019t thrown 10% curveballs since 2017.",
      "\u201cIf you look around the game, swing and miss has taken more of a priority, so guys are trying to throw more sweepers with more horizontal movement, or they\u2019re trying to throw the slider really hard at the bottom of the zone,\u201d Athletics pitching coach Scott Emerson said. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about contact with the curveball.\u201d",
      "Veteran pitchers note the curve\u2019s decline as youngsters integrate into staffs.",
      "\u201cAs you\u2019re an amateur going to the big leagues guys are looking at velo. Guys are just looking at stuff,\u201d Yankees ace Gerrit Cole said. \u201cVelo is important and it pays.\u201d",
      "Maybe because the pitchers who throw curves are committed, batters have a .225 average this season on curves, down from .263 on fastballs and up slightly from .222 on sliders, sweepers and slurves.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just how the game is trending: to throw it as hard as you can, spin it the best you can and hope the hitter doesn\u2019t hit it,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cThe hitters are up there trying to swing as hard they can. If they hit it with hard contact, make 27 swings that are really hard, you got a chance to hit a homer here and there. And it\u2019s taken away from the contact-type pitchers.\u201d",

      "Jannik Sinner can look forward to his next matchup against Carlos Alcaraz now because he has finally ended a losing streak against his rival",
      "LONDON -- Jannik Sinner needed this victory.",
      "He wanted to win Wimbledon, of course, and it would have meant a lot to him no matter who the opponent was in the final.",
      "That this championship, his fourth at a Grand Slam tournament, came via a win over Carlos Alcaraz made it all the more significant to Sinner \u2014 and to the future of their burgeoning rivalry, the best men's tennis has to offer these days and, perhaps, for many years to come.",
      "\u201cIt is important, for sure,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sinner said Sunday night after prevailing 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 against No. 2 Alcaraz, \u201cbecause when you lose several times against someone, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d",
      "Sinner had lost five matches in a row against Alcaraz, none more disheartening than the one they played last month in the French Open final. Sinner grabbed a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of championship points, before losing in five sets after 5 hours, 29 minutes.",
      "\u201cI keep looking up to Carlos, because even today, I felt like he was doing couple of things better than I did,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something ... we will work on and prepare ourselves, because he\u2019s going to come for us again.\u201d",
      "Perhaps as soon as at the U.S. Open, which starts in New York on Aug. 24 and where Sinner is the defending champion. They will be seeded No. 1 and No. 2 again, so could only meet there in another final.",
      "Alcaraz won the trophy at Flushing Meadows in 2022, beginning a stretch in which he and Sinner have combined to win nine of the past 12 majors. That includes the last seven, leaving zero doubt that these two young guys \u2014 Sinner is 23, Alcaraz is 22 \u2014 have pushed themselves way past everyone else in the game at the moment.",
      "\u201cI'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him. It\u2019s great for us, and it is great for tennis. Every time we play against each other, our level is really high,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t (see) a level like this, if I\u2019m honest with you. I don\u2019t see any (other players) playing against each other (and) having the level that we are playing when we face each other.\u201d",
      "Both serve well, although Sinner was better at that Sunday. Both return well, although, again, Sinner was superior over these particular three hours. Both cover the court exceedingly well \u2014 Alcaraz is faster; Sinner has a bigger reach and is a better slider. Both hit the ball so, so hard \u2014 Alcaraz is more prone to the spectacular; Sinner is as pure and consistent a ball-striker as there is.",
      "And so on.",
      "One other contrast, usually, is that Alcaraz shows emotion, whether via yells of \u201cVamos!\u201d or the sort of point-to-his-ear-then-pump-his-fist celebration he did after winning Sunday's opening set by stretching and reaching low for a cross-court backhand to close a 12-stroke point.",
      "Sinner is far more contained. Even his arm-raised victory poses are mild-mannered.",
      "Sunday, though, there were more visible displays. He even shouted \u201cLet's go!\u201d after one point. Later, he shook his racket overhead while the crowd roared after a well-struck backhand. When he took a set with a forehand winner, Sinner held a pose, then lifted a fist.",
      "When the match was over, he crouched, lowered his head and pounded his right palm on the grass five times.",
      "\u201cYou saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments,\" said one of Sinner's coaches, Darren Cahill, \"and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that, when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.\u201d",
      "Both players spoke about their matchup motivating them to work hard to try to improve.",
      "\u201cIt gives me the opportunity to just give my 100% every practice, every day. Just to be better, thanks to that,\u201d said Alcaraz, who won the past two Wimbledon titles and was 5-0 in Grand Slam finals before Sunday. \u201cThe level that I have to maintain, and I have to raise, if I want to beat Jannik is really high.\u201d",
      "Sinner described Alcaraz as \u201csomeone who is young, who wins basically everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to be ready,\u201d Sinner explained, \u201cif you want to keep up.\u201d",

      "Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming around a baby sun-like star",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system\u2019s planets.",
      "The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, \u201cso we didn\u2019t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system,\u201d McClure said in an email. \u201cOur study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.\u201d",
      "While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there\u2019s been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.",
      "In a stunning picture taken by the ESO's Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many planets might form around HOPS-315. With a gas disk as massive as the sun\u2019s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.",
      "Purdue University\u2019s Merel van \u2019t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",
      "\u201cI think that H20 is going to be very successful here,\u201d he said, noting the chip's memory bandwidth makes it a good fit for the AI models being developed by Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba.",
      "Huang also touted the release of a new RTX Pro graphics chip that he said would power the development of humanoid robots. He described robotic systems with teams of robots working alongside people as the next wave in AI.",
      "\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much robotics innovation going on and so much smart factory work being done here and the supply chain is so vast, RTX Pro is perfect,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some dolphins in Australia have a special technique to flush fish from the seafloor. They hunt with a sponge on their beak, like a clown nose.",
      "Using the sponge to protect from sharp rocks, the dolphins swim with their beaks covered, shoveling through rubble at the bottom of sandy channels and stirring up barred sandperch for a meal.",
      "But this behavior \u2014 passed down through generations \u2014 is trickier than it looks, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",

      "\u201cIt has a muffling effect in the way that a mask might,\u201d said co-author Ellen Rose Jacobs, a marine biologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. \u201cEverything looks a little bit weird, but you can still learn how to compensate.\"",
      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",

      "Sponge hunting is \u201clike hunting when you\u2019re blindfolded \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be very good, very well-trained to pull it off,\" said Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "That difficulty may explain why it's rare \u2014 with only about 5% of the dolphin population studied by the researchers in Shark Bay doing it. That\u2019s about 30 dolphins total, said Jacobs.",

      "Major League Baseball is testing automated ball-strike systems in the All-Star Game for the first time",
      "ATLANTA -- Tarik Skubal views the strike zone differently than robot umpires.",
      "\u201cI have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,\u201d Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful.",
      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

    "story": [
      "A study puts the spotlight on Texas as the leading U.S. state by far for flood-related deaths, with more than 1,000 of them from 1959 to 2019",
      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

      "A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect",
      "NEW YORK -- A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work.",
      "The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees.",
      "Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule.",
      "\u201cNo subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,\" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule.",
      "Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges \u2014 including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription.",
      "\u201cCompanies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers\u2019 accounts,\u201d said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. \u201cPeople should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.\u201d",
      "Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble.",
      "Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free \u2014 or for a fee \u2014 and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services.",
      "For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee.",
      "The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon\u2019s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.",
      "Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate \u2014 half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again.",
      "Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates.",
      "The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer\u2019s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million.",
      "The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule\u2019s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC\u2019s proposal as part of its \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles.",

      "Wyoming's first new coal mine in 50 years is said to be opening soon but it won't rely on the fossil fuel to make money",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- The developer of what would be the first new coal mine in Wyoming in decades plans to process the fossil fuel to extract hard-to-get metals that are crucial for tech products and military hardware.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, former West Virginia U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, and Wyoming's congressional delegation are on the VIP list for a groundbreaking ceremony Friday at the Ramaco Resources, Inc., Brook Mine outside Ranchester in far northern Wyoming.",
      "Rare earth elements are a family of 17 metallic elements with unusual properties that make them useful for specific applications. Neodymium and dysprosium are used in the permanent magnets of wind turbines, lanthanum in electric and hybrid car batteries.",
      "Yttrium and terbium have critical military uses, including in targeting devices.",
      "China supplies almost 90% of the world's rare earths. Concern about continued access to the substances has been a focus of recent negotiations between China and the U.S., and led the Trump administration to try to encourage more production domestically.",
      "Rare earths aren't especially rare but so scattered they are difficult to bring together in useful quantities. Currently the only U.S. rare earths mine is at Mountain Pass in California.",
      "Analysis by U.S. national laboratories show the Brook Mine coal contains valuable quantities of the rare earths neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, as well as the critical minerals gallium, scandium and germanium, according to a Ramaco letter to shareholders on July 1.",
      "\u201cWe would intend to mine it here in Wyoming, process it here in Wyoming and sell it to domestic customers including the government,\u201d Ramaco CEO Randall Atkins said Thursday.",
      "Manchin, who left office in January after not seeking re-election, joined the Ramaco board in April.",
      "No new Wyoming coal mine has opened in 50 years. Wyoming's coal industry instead has shrunk substantially since its peak over a decade ago, troubled as utilities switch to renewable energy and power plants fueled by cheaper natural gas.",
      "The Brook Mine, stalled in part by landowners worried about groundwater depletion, has been in the works for over a decade. Atkins originally envisioned it as a source of subbituminous power plant fuel, much like Wyoming's massive open-pit mines that supply about 40% of the nation's coal.",
      "A public company with metallurgical coal mines in Appalachia, Ramaco in recent years received Department of Energy grants to develop coal into carbon-based products such as carbon fiber. This year, it got a $6.1 million grant from Wyoming to build a rare earth and critical minerals processing plant.",
      "A consultant report released this week found that fully developing the mine and processing plant would cost around $500 million, a sum that could be recovered in five years if the rare earths can be extracted and sold. Ramaco also would sell the processed coal as fuel, Atkins said.",

      "A dinosaur fossil has been found in an unlikely place, a hole drilled under the parking lot of a Colorado museum where dinosaur skeletons are on display",
      "DENVER -- A Denver museum known for its dinosaur displays has made a fossil bone discovery closer to home than anyone ever expected, under its own parking lot.",
      "It came from a hole drilled more than 750 feet (230 meters) deep to study geothermal heating potential for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "The museum is popular with dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Full-size dinosaur skeletons amaze kiddos barely knee-high to a parent, much less to a Tyrannosaurus.",
      "This latest find is not so visually impressive. Even so, the odds of finding the hockey-puck-shaped fossil sample were impressively small.",
      "With a bore only a couple of inches (5 centimeters) wide, museum officials struggled to describe just how unlikely it was to hit a dinosaur, even in a region with a fair number of such fossils.",
      "\u201cFinding a dinosaur bone in a core is like hitting a hole in one from the moon. It\u2019s like winning the Willy Wonka factory. It\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s super rare,\u201d said James Hagadorn, the museum\u2019s curator of geology.",
      "Only two similar finds have been noted in bore hole samples anywhere in the world, not to mention on the grounds of a dinosaur museum, according to museum officials.",
      "A vertebra of a smallish, plant-eating dinosaur is believed to be the source. It lived in the late Cretaceous period around 67.5 million years ago. An asteroid impact brought the long era of dinosaurs to an end around 66 million years ago, according to scientists.",
      "Fossilized vegetation also was found in the bore hole near the bone.",
      "\u201cThis animal was living in what was probably a swampy environment that would have been heavily vegetated at the time,\u201d said Patrick O'Connor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "Dinosaur discoveries in the area over the years include portions of Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops-type fossils. This one is Denver's deepest and oldest yet, O'Connor said.",
      "Other experts in the field vouched for the find's legitimacy but with mixed reactions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, I guess. Scientifically it\u2019s not that exciting,\u201d said Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science in Albuquerque.",
      "There was no way to tell exactly what species of dinosaur it was, Williamson noted.",
      "The find is \"absolutely legit and VERY COOL!\u201d Erin LaCount, director of education programs at the Dinosaur Ridge track site just west of Denver, said by email.",
      "The fossil's shape suggests it was a duck-billed dinosaur or thescelosaurus, a smaller but somewhat similar species, LaCount noted.",
      "The bore-hole fossil is now on display in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, of course, but there are no plans to look for more under the parking lot.",
      "\u201cI would love to dig a 763-foot (233-meter) hole in the parking lot to excavate that dinosaur, the rest of it. But I don't think that's going to fly because we really need parking,\u201d Hagadorn said.",

      "The Data Protection Commission opened the inquiry as a follow up to a previous investigation that ended earlier this year with a 530 million euro ($620 million) fine after it found the video sharing app put users at risk of spying by allowing remote access their data from China.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company is taking down antisemitic comments and other \u201cinappropriate posts\u201d made by its Grok chatbot, including some praising Adolf Hitler",
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company said Wednesday that it's taking down \u201cinappropriate posts\" made by its Grok chatbot, which appeared to include antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Grok was developed by Musk\u2019s xAI and pitched as alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d interactions from rival chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini, or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Musk said Friday that Grok has been improved significantly, and users \u201cshould notice a difference.\u201d",
      "Since then, Grok has shared several antisemitic posts, including the trope that Jews run Hollywood, and denied that such a stance could be described as Nazism.",
      "\u201cLabeling truths as hate speech stifles discussion,\u201d Grok said.",
      "It also appeared to praise Hitler, according to screenshots of posts that have now apparently been deleted.",
      "After making one of the posts, Grok walked back the comments, saying it was \u201can unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration, swiftly deleted\" and that it condemned \"Nazism and Hitler unequivocally \u2014 his actions were genocidal horrors.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\u201d the Grok account posted early Wednesday, without being more specific.",
      "\"Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.",
      "Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it\u2019s likely that the Grok update that caused the chatbot to spew antisemitic messages this week was the \u201csoft launch\u201d of Grok 4, which Musk plans to introduce late Wednesday. But if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t appear ready, she said.",
      "\u201cFixing this is probably going to require retraining the model,\u201d she said. \u201cAll they can do at this point, if they\u2019re really going to launch tonight, are some more Band-Aids, like adding filters on responses and tweaking the prompt.\u201d",
      "Editing some of the chatbot\u2019s instructions \u201cmight make its behavior a little bit better\u201d but won\u2019t fix all of its problems.",
      "Musk and the xAI staff did release the latest version of the Grok platform late Wednesday, with the Tesla CEO making fantastical claims about the intelligence of version 4.0.",
      "He compared its intelligence to post-graduate level in \u201cevery subject\u201d and said while at times it might lack common sense and has not yet invented new things or discovered new technologies, it might \u201cas soon as this year.\u201d",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which works to combat antisemitism, called out Grok's behavior.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing from Grok LLM right now is irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic, plain and simple,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cThis supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the antisemitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms.\u201d",
      "Musk later waded into the debate, alleging that some users may have been trying to manipulate Grok into making the statements.",
      "\u201cGrok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed,\u201d he wrote on X, in response to comments that a user was trying to get Grok to make controversial and politically incorrect statements.",
      "Also Wednesday, a court in Turkey ordered a ban on Grok and Poland's digital minister said he would report the chatbot to the European Commission after it made vulgar comments about politicians and public figures in both countries.",
      "Krzysztof Gawkowski, who's also Poland's deputy prime minister, told private broadcaster RMF FM that his ministry would report Grok \u201cfor investigation and, if necessary, imposing a fine on X.\u201d Under an EU digital law, social media platforms are required to protect users or face hefty fines.",
      "\u201cI have the impression that we\u2019re entering a higher level of hate speech, which is controlled by algorithms, and that turning a blind eye ... is a mistake that could cost people in the future,\u201d Gawkowski told the station.",
      "Turkey's pro-government A Haber news channel reported that Grok posted vulgarities about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and well-known personalities. Offensive responses were also directed toward modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, other media outlets said.",
      "That prompted the Ankara public prosecutor to file for the imposition of restrictions under Turkey\u2019s internet law, citing a threat to public order. A criminal court approved the request early on Wednesday, ordering the country\u2019s telecommunications authority to enforce the ban.",
      "It's not the first time Grok's behavior has raised questions.",
      "Earlier this year the chatbot kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d despite being asked a variety of questions, most of which had nothing to do with the country. An \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d was behind the problem, xAI said.",

      "The program known as PEPFAR is one of the most effective and popular U.S. foreign aid projects in history, and the government says it has saved the lives of over 25 million people around the world with HIV",
      "The program known as PEPFAR is one of the most effective and popular U.S. foreign aid projects in history, and the government says it has saved the lives of over 25 million people around the world with HIV.",
      "But despite years of bipartisan support, PEPFAR has faced a severe threat as the Trump administration dismantles most U.S. foreign aid.",
      "PEPFAR on Tuesday appeared to be spared a $400 million cut as Republicans acted in rare defiance of a request by President Donald Trump. But governments, health experts and people with HIV around the world are alarmed by the effects of other U.S. aid cuts and chaos that are already disrupting the crucial supply of HIV drugs \u2014 which are meant to be taken daily.",
      "Here's a look at PEPFAR and how it affects millions of people globally.",
      "Today, many babies are born infection-free to mothers with HIV \u2014 the U.S. State Department says PEPFAR has been responsible for 5.5 million such births \u2014 and most people around the world no longer see an infection as a death sentence.",
      "Governments in Africa and elsewhere had even begun to worry about complacency as people, especially youths, took the widespread availability of HIV drugs for granted. In another significant step forward, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved for use the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV.",
      "But the abrupt U.S. aid cuts have health officials in developing countries warning of a return to the early days of the AIDS pandemic, when drugs were nonexistent or severely limited and clinics were filled with the dying. PEPFAR was launched in 2004 in response to those grim scenes.",
      "Also known as the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the program has partnered with nonprofit groups to provide HIV medication \u2014 including the preventative PrEP \u2014 to millions around the world. It has strengthened national health care systems, cared for children orphaned by AIDS and provided job training for people at risk. It has played an important role in testing for and tracking HIV infections.",
      "HIV/AIDS has no cure, and it has killed over 40 million people globally over the years. Now the U.N. agency on AIDS is warning that analysis suggests 4 million additional AIDS-related deaths between now and 2029, including 300,000 additional children\u2019s deaths, if programs permanently lose PEPFAR's support.",
      "Since PEPFAR's creation by Congress and Republican President George W. Bush, the program has largely enjoyed support across the political spectrum \u2014 and gratitude from countries whose health systems have been poorly equipped to care for millions with HIV.",
      "But misinformation has crept in. The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative Washington think tank, accused the Biden administration of using PEPFAR \u201cto promote its domestic radical social agenda overseas.\u201d Conservatives claimed there were efforts to integrate abortion with HIV/AIDS prevention, a claim the Biden administration denied. Similar claims linger under the Trump administration.",
      "Trump and his officials also claim widespread waste and fraud as they seek to dismantle U.S. foreign aid. But PEPFAR has been repeatedly scrutinized. Last year, the government said the State Department's Office of Inspector General had conducted 80 audits, inspections, and special reviews that included oversight of PEPFAR programs, \u201cincluding 21 thematic reviews and audits specifically focused on PEPFAR.\u201d",
      "The $400 million proposed cut to PEPFAR still could be restored, in part or in full, as the bill on spending cuts faces a final vote in the Senate, a vote in the House of Representatives and Trump's signature before a Friday deadline.",
      "\u201cWe must stay vigilant,\u201d International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement Wednesday after PEPFAR appeared to be spared.",
      "No matter what, countries and health experts say it will be impossible to fill the funding gap left by the overall U.S. withdrawal of billions of dollars in aid for the global HIV response, including via PEPFAR.",
      "Last month, a UNAIDS report said the abrupt cuts have \u201cdestabilized supply chains, led to the closure of health facilities, left thousands of health clinics without staff, set back prevention programs, disrupted HIV testing efforts and forced many community organizations to reduce or halt their HIV activities.\u201d",
      "South Africa, where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world, has said 12 specialized HIV clinics that were funded by the U.S. have had to close down and over 8,000 health workers in its national HIV program are out of work.",
      "Now health workers there and elsewhere are trying to track down an unknown number of people who have lost access to HIV medication. The stakes are deadly. Stopping the drugs allows the virus to start multiplying again. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. The virus could even become drug-resistant.",
      "\u201cIt has really been hectic for us,\u201d said Mbonisiwe Hlongwane, manager of the HIV program at the Bertha Gxowa public hospital in Germiston, east of Johannesburg. And the uncertainty only continues.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a public statement made less than 24 hours after suggesting in a private meeting that he was leaning in favor of dismissing the head of the nation's central bank.",
      "Trump confirmed that in a White House meeting Tuesday night with about a dozen House Republicans he had discussed the \u201cconcept\u201d of dismissing Powell, long a target because of his refusal to lower interest rates as Trump wants.",
      "\u201cAlmost every one of them said I should,\u201d Trump said about the lawmakers who had come to talk to him about crypto legislation.",
      "He indicated he was leaning in that direction, according to a White House official. During that session, Trump waved a letter about firing Powell, but a person familiar with the matter said it was essentially a prop drafted by someone else and that the Republican president has not drafted such a letter.",
      "Neither source was authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and they spoke only on condition on anonymity.",
      "Trump made his comment about being \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to dismiss Powell \u2014 \u201dunless he has to leave for fraud\u201d \u2014 during an Oval Office meeting with Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the crown prince of Bahrain.",
      "In recent days, White House and administration officials have accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed, adding to months of efforts by Trump try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker.",
      "U.S. stocks were shaky as Trump spoke about Powell on Wednesday. The S&P 500's modest gain in the morning became a drop of 0.7% after initial reports that the president may fire the Fed chair. Stocks then trimmed their losses after Trump's later comment.",
      "Treasury yields also swiveled in the bond market but remained mostly calm.",
      "Those at the White House meeting were among the more far-right lawmakers, including members of the House Freedom Cause whose views are not always shared by other Republicans. In the Senate, Republicans have taken a more guarded approach. Some have backed Powell\u2019s performance at the Fed as they await an inspector general's review of the construction project.",
      "In a speech Wednesday, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said if Powell is dismissed, \u201cyou are going to see a pretty immediate response\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anybody thinks it would be a good idea for the Fed to become another agency in the government subject to the president, they\u2019re making a huge mistake,\" said Tillis, who has announced that he is not running for reelection.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said this week that Powell \u201chas done a decent job.\u201d",
      "\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been perfect,\u201d he said, adding that there have been times they disagreed, but \u201cI do believe that the chairman is calling them like he sees them.\u201d",
      "Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee had been scheduled to meet with Powell on Wednesday evening in a gathering set months ago, but it was abruptly canceled due to votes in the House, according to a committee aide granted anonymity to discuss a private meeting.",

      "Vance Boelter, 57, is due in federal court for his arraignment on Sept. 12 under an order issued late Tuesday, hours after a grand jury indicted him on six counts of murder, stalking and firearms violations. The murder charges could carry the federal death penalty.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, prosecutors released a rambling handwritten letter they say Boelter wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel in which he confessed to the June 14 shootings of Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark. However, the letter doesn't make clear why he targeted the couples.",
      "Boelter's federal defender, Manny Atwal, said in an email that the weighty charges do not come as a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe indictment starts the process of receiving discovery which will allow me to evaluate the case,\u201d Atwal said Tuesday. She did not immediately comment Wednesday on any possible defense strategies.",

      "Investigators have already gathered a huge amount of evidence that both sides will need time to evaluate. The scheduling order acknowledges that both sides may find grounds for seeking extensions. And the potential for a death sentence adds yet another level of complexity.",

      "Minnesota abolished its state death penalty in 1911, but the Trump administration says it intends to be aggressive in seeking capital punishment for eligible federal crimes.",
      "Boelter's motivations remain murky. Friends have described him as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views who had been struggling to find work. Boelter allegedly made lists of politicians in Minnesota and other states \u2014 all or mostly Democrats \u2014 and attorneys at national law firms. In an interview published by the New York Post on Saturday, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for President Donald Trump, but he declined to elaborate on that point.",
      "\u201cThere is little evidence showing why he turned to political violence and extremism,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "Prosecutors say Boelter was disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car early June 14 when he went to the Hoffmans' home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin. He allegedly shot the senator nine times, and his wife, Yvette, eight times, but they survived.",
      "Boelter later allegedly went to the Hortmans\u2019 home in nearby Brooklyn Park and killed both of them. Their dog was so gravely injured that he had to be euthanized.",
      "Investigators found Boelter's letter to the FBI director in the car he abandoned near his rural home in Green Isle, west of Minneapolis. He surrendered the night after the shootings following what authorities have called the largest search for a suspect in Minnesota history.",

      "HOUSTON -- A judge on Wednesday set a new execution date for Robert Roberson, a Texas man who won a last-minute reprieve last year and could become the first person in the U.S. to be put to death for a murder conviction tied to a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "State district Judge Austin Reeve Jackson set an Oct. 16 execution date for Roberson during a court hearing.",

      "Roberson received a last-minute stay last October after a flurry of legal challenges that were prompted by an unprecedented maneuver from a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers who say he is innocent and was sent to death row based on flawed science.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of the 2002 killing of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. Prosecutors argued he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what\u2019s called shaken baby syndrome. His lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia.",

      "The Massachusetts assisted-living facility where a fatal fire killed nine people was caring for dozens of aging residents reliant on wheelchairs and oxygen tanks, but it lacked the safety measures and most of the staffing requirements that are commonplace in nursing homes.",
      "As an assisted-living center, Gabriel House in Fall River, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Boston, offered a type of housing for older residents that has expanded nationally in recent decades. But advocates argue that the absence of any federal regulations and spotty state rules mean the sector is largely left to police itself.",
      "\u201cThe real issue is that assisted livings operate in an environment like the Wild West,\u201d said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for improved care in nursing and assisted-living facilities. \u201cThey can pretty much do what they want with impunity, and that results in a lot of, I would say, mini-catastrophes every day, frankly.\u201d",
      "The fire that tore through the three-story structure late Sunday raised a host of questions about conditions at the dilapidated facility and put the spotlight on the growing number of assisted-living centers in the state and nationwide.",
      "Created in the 1980s, assisted living has been marketed as an option for older adults who need some assistance but not as much help as a nursing home. Advocates argue that regulations for the facilities have not kept up as more locations have opened.",
      "Nursing homes, for example, are governed by federal regulations because they receive Medicare and Medicaid while there are no federal regulations for assisted-living facilities. Nursing homes must have a minimum number of staffers and trained medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, but assisted-living facilities have no such requirements.",
      "\u201cThe regulations are minimal,\u201d said Liane Zeitz, an attorney who is also a member of the state Assisted Living Residences Commission, a body created to make recommendations about the sector. She has advocated for more regulations for assisted-living facilities.",
      "The facilities were lightly regulated because initially they were regarded as residential, with lower levels of care and less oversight, she said. But now those facilities are caring for a population \"that is much frailer, and the population is growing.\u201d",
      "Not only are the regulations weaker for assisted-living facilities, but advocates argue that the enforcement of the existing rules is often lax.",
      "Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts secretary of elder affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, described a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of regulations across the country, with different agencies involved depending on the state.",
      "\u201cSome of the states are much more regulated. Some are regulated as a health care entity. Others, as we do here in Massachusetts, are considered a residential housing model,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been advocating for increased oversight for years, particularly after the release of reports about health and safety problems in 2018.",
      "\u201cThese are serious problems that have been going on for years,\u201d she said at a hearing last year. \u201cBut we hear so much less about what\u2019s going in assisted-living facilities than we do in other facilities, like nursing homes.\u201d",
      "At that hearing, Mollot noted that scandals in the nursing home industry pushed Congress to act in the 1970s and 1980s, and that such a reckoning could be coming soon for assisted living. He described two major risks: increasingly sick and vulnerable assisted living residents and financial exploitation by owner investors.",
      "Speaking Wednesday after learning about the Gabriel House fire, Mollot said the problems that plagued that facility are not unique to Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cUnlike nursing homes, assisted living has no federal state requirements, no requirement for staffing, no requirements for staff training, no requirements for safety protocols, no requirements for inspections,\u201d he said. \u201cThat falls to the states, and the states have overall very weak rules.\u201d",

      "\u201cTo grant the defendant the relief requested in the motion would constitute an inunction prohibiting the United States from moving forward with an internal decision-making process of the Executive Branch and would intrude upon its independent prosecutorial discretion,\u201d Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Dresser wrote.",
      "Younglbut is charged with using a deadly weapon against law enforcement and discharging a firearm during an assault with a deadly weapon.",
      "Youngblut\u2019s attorneys have asked the court to give her until at least Jan. 30, 2026, to submit her mitigating evidence to a committee of lawyers that advises the government on capital cases and to prohibit prosecutors from making a decision about the death penalty until after the material has been reviewed.",
      "The defense argues the schedule \u201cpromises to turn Ms. Youngblut's submission into a near-pointless formality.\u201d Prosecutors countered that Youngblut has no right \"beyond the Executive Branch\u2019s invitation\" to participate in the government's internal capital review.",
      "At the time of the shooting, authorities had been watching Youngblut and her companion, Felix Bauckholt, for several days after a Vermont hotel employee reported seeing them carrying guns and wearing black tactical gear. She\u2019s accused of opening fire on border agents who pulled the car over on Interstate 91. An agent fired back, killing Bauckholt and wounding Youngblut.",
      "The pair were among the followers of Jack LaSota, a transgender woman also known as Ziz whose online writing about veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence attracted young, highly intelligent computer scientists who shared anarchist beliefs. Members of the group have been tied to the death of one of their own during an attack on a California landlord in 2022, the landlord\u2019s subsequent killing earlier this year, and the deaths of a Pennsylvania couple in between.",
      "LaSota and two others face weapons and drug charges in Maryland, where they were arrested in February, while LaSota faces additional federal charges of being an armed fugitive. Maximilian Snyder, who is charged with killing the landlord in California, had applied for a marriage license with Youngblut. His attorney has declined to comment.",

      "A federal judge in Tennessee could rule on whether to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia from jail as he awaits trial on human smuggling charges",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A federal judge in Tennessee could rule Wednesday on whether to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia from jail to await trial on human smuggling charges, a decision that could allow President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to try to deport the Maryland construction worker for a second time.",
      "Lawyers for the Justice Department have said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will detain Abrego Garcia if he's freed. ICE officials have said they will initiate deportation proceedings against the Salvadoran national and will possibly try to send him to a third country such as Mexico or South Sudan.",
      "Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint over the Republican Trump\u2019s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native El Salvador in March. That expulsion violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s 2019 order that shields Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he likely faces threats of gang violence there.",
      "The Trump administration claimed Abrego Garcia was in the MS-13 gang, although he wasn\u2019t charged and has repeatedly denied the allegation. Facing mounting pressure and a U.S. Supreme Court order, the administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last month to face the smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \u201cpreposterous.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr. scheduled a hearing in Nashville to consider the matter of releasing Abrego Garcia from jail to await his trial.",
      "Waverly will review last month's order by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville to free Abrego Garcia. Holmes determined that Abrego Garcia was not a flight risk or a danger to the community and set various conditions for his release, including wearing an ankle bracelet and living with his brother in Maryland.",
      "Waverly scheduled Wednesday's hearing following a motion by federal prosecutors to revoke Holmes' release order. The prosecutors argue Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and a danger to the community.",
      "Holmes has kept Abrego Garcia in jail at the request of his lawyers over concerns the Trump administration will try to deport him upon release. The attorneys asked Holmes to keep him in jail until Wednesday's hearing before Waverly to review her release order.",
      "The smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers. Police in Tennessee suspected human smuggling, but he was allowed to drive on.",
      "Abrego Garcia lived and worked in Maryland for more than a decade, doing construction and raising a family. Abrego Garcia's American wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, is suing the Trump administration in federal court in Maryland over his wrongful deportation in March, while trying to prevent any attempts to expel him again.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have asked U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland to order the government to send him to Maryland if he\u2019s released in Tennessee, a request that aims to prevent his expulsion before trial.",
      "In court on Friday, Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys also asked for at least a 72-hour hold that would prevent his immediate deportation. Attorney Andrew Rossman called it the \u201ccritical bottom-line protection\u201d needed to prevent a potentially egregious violation of due process rights.",
      "Xinis didn\u2019t rule from the bench Friday but said she\u2019d issue an order before Waverly's hearing on Wednesday.",
      "If Abrego Garcia is released into ICE custody, his lawyers have vowed to fight expulsion efforts within the U.S. immigration court system, which is part of the Justice Department.",

A day later, police arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with the killings.",

      "Investigators believe Boodarian was burglarizing the home several days earlier while the couple was away. Police had been called to the residence on July 10 but found no signs of trouble or forced entry. Now, detectives suspect that Boodarian managed to get into the house through an unlocked door and was surprised by Kaye and Deluca.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former New York City interim police commissioner filed a civil racketeering lawsuit Wednesday against his one-time boss, Mayor Eric Adams, and other top department officials, alleging they showered loyalists with unearned promotions, buried allegations of misconduct and gratuitously punished whistleblowers.",
      "In a lawsuit filed in federal court, the ex-commissioner, Thomas Donlon, accused Adams and his inner circle of operating the nation\u2019s largest police department as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\"",
      "Their alleged corruption triggered a \u201cmassive, unlawful transfer of public wealth,\u201d the suit states, through unearned salary increases, overtime payments, pension enhancement and other benefits.",
      "At times, top officials forged internal documents to promote politically connected officers or those whose silence they were seeking, according to the lawsuit.",
      "With Adams\u2019 approval, his cadre of hand-picked police leaders also sought to obstruct internal investigations, while targeting dissenters with leaks through the press, the suit alleges.",
      "Inquiries to the New York City Police Department and City Hall were not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit is not a personal grievance,\u201d Donlon said in a statement. \u201cIt is a statement against a corrupt system that betrays the public, silences truth, and punishes integrity.\u201d",
      "Donlon, a career FBI official who had not previously worked in the NYPD, was brought in as interim commissioner last September to stabilize a department shaken by federal investigations.",
      "His predecessor, Edward Caban, stepped down after federal authorities seized his electronic devices as part of an investigation that also involved his brother, a former police officer, along with several other high-ranking police officials. Caban has denied wrongdoing and not been criminally charged.",
      "Donlon had spent decades working on terrorism cases, including the investigation into the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and was a top counterterrorism official for the FBI\u2019s New York office. He also led New York state\u2019s Office of Homeland Security before going into the private sector security industry.",
      "But about a week into his tenure, federal authorities searched Donlon\u2019s homes and seized decades old materials that he said at the time were unrelated to his work with the NYPD.",
      "Donlon lasted about two months on the job before current police Commissioner Jessica Tisch took over, pledging to restore trust to the department.",
      "But as he seeks reelection, Adams faces renewed scrutiny over his management of the police force.",
      "Last week, four other former high-ranking New York City police officials filed separate lawsuits against Adams and his top deputies, alleging a culture of rampant corruption and bribes that preceded Donlon\u2019s appointment.",
      "In response to that suit, a spokesperson for Adams said the administration \u201cholds all city employees \u2014 including leadership at the NYPD \u2014 to the highest standards.\u201d",

      "The forged police reports would indicate that the immigrant was a victim of a crime, U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said at a news conference in Baton Rouge. He said the police officials were paid $5,000 for each name they provided falsified reports for, and that there were hundreds of names.",

      "Van Hook and others said at the news conference that the arrest of the current or former chiefs and two other people doesn't mean their police departments are corrupt.",
      "Some crime victims, and their families, may be eligible for temporary visas \u2014 and, in some cases, a path to citizenship. About 10,000 people got these \u201cU-visas\u201d in the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 2022, the latest period for which the Homeland Security Department has published data.",

      "The audit found the agency approved a handful of suspicious law enforcement signatures that were not cross-referenced with a database of authorized signatures, according to the OIG report. They were also not closely tracking fraud case outcomes, the total number of U-visas granted per year, and were not effectively managing the backlog, which led to crime victims waiting for nearly 10 years before receiving a U-visa.",

      "Planned Parenthood isn't the only abortion provider that stands to lose Medicaid payments under a budget plan signed by President Donald Trump",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- An item in Republicans' sweeping policy and tax bill intended to block Medicaid dollars from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s biggest abortion provider, is also hitting a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "Maine Family Planning filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration Wednesday seeking to restore the reimbursements.",
      "Accessing health care in Maine \u2014 one of the Northeast's poorest states and its most rural \u2014 is a challenge in areas far from population centers such as Portland and Bangor.",
      "Vanessa Shields-Haas, a nurse practitioner, said the organization's clinics have been seeing all patients as usual and completing Medicaid paperwork for visits \u2014 but not submitting it because it appears the provision took effect as soon as the law was signed.",
      "\u201cKnowing how hard it is to access care in this state, not allowing these community members to access their care, it's cruel,\" Shields-Haas said.",
      "Republican lawmakers targeted Planned Parenthood in one piece of what President Donald Trump dubbed the \u201cbig beautiful\u201d bill that Congress passed and the president signed earlier this month.",
      "While advocates focused on Planned Parenthood, the bill did not mention it by name. Instead, it cut off reimbursements for organizations that are primarily engaged in family planning services \u2014 which generally include things such as contraception, abortion and pregnancy tests \u2014 and received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023.",
      "The U.S. Senate's parliamentarian rejected a 2017 effort to defund Planned Parenthood because it was written to exclude all other providers by barring payments only to groups that received more than $350 million a year in Medicaid funds. The not-for-profit Maine organization asserts in its legal challenge that the threshold was lowered to $800,000 this time around to make sure Planned Parenthood would not be the only affected entity.",
      "It is the only other organization that has come forward publicly to say that its funding is at risk, too.",
      "Federal law already bars taxpayer money from covering most abortions. Instead, the money in question involves other health services, such as cancer screenings and tests, and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.",
      "Proponents of that wrinkle in the law say abortion providers use Medicaid money for other services to subsidize abortion.",
      "\u201cThis has never been just about Planned Parenthood,\" Autumn Christensen, vice president of public policy for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement. \"It\u2019s about any Big Abortion business or network that performs abortions. Taxpayers should never be forced to prop up an industry that profits from ending human lives.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press has sought comment from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is named in the lawsuit.",
      "Maine Family Planning operates 18 clinics across the state.",
      "In 2024, it had about 7,200 family planning patients, including 645 who obtained abortions. Services include pregnancy testing, contraception, family planning counseling, breast exams, cancer screenings and treatment of sexually transmitted infections.",
      "Some of the sites also offer primary care services, where there are another 600 or so patients. There are about 800 gender-affirming care patients and about 200 who use its upstart mobile clinic, said George Hill, the president and CEO of the organization.",
      "Hill said that for about two-thirds of its patients, Maine Family Planning is the only place they get medical care in a typical year.",
      "About half of the patients not seeking abortions are enrolled in Medicaid, and the clinics have been receiving about $1.9 million a year in reimbursements, which accounts for about one-fourth of the organization's budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult state to provide care in and now we\u2019re facing this,\u201d Hill said. In its lawsuit, the group says it has enough reserves to keep seeing patients covered by Medicaid without reimbursement only through October.",
      "Maine Family Planning says that if it had to turn away patients, it would be more complicated for them than simply finding another provider. There aren\u2019t enough in rural areas, the group notes \u2014 and many don\u2019t accept Medicaid.",
      "One patient, Ashley Smith, said she started going to Maine Family Planning about five years ago when she could not find other health care she could afford. While she's not enrolled in Medicaid, she fears clinics could be shuttered because of cuts.",
      "\u201cI am so worried that if my clinic closes, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do or if I\u2019ll be able to see another provider,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Maine Family Planning also supports care at more than 40 other health care facilities. Other than the Planned Parenthood locations that receive money from Maine Family Planning, those other providers don't stand to lose their Medicaid reimbursements.",
      "But, Hill said, the loss of Medicaid funding for Maine Family Planning would mean the group would have less to send to partners.",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Maine Family Planning in the challenge, says in its legal filing that the defunding denies it equal protection under the law because it would have funding cut off, but organizations that provide similar services would not.",
      "\u201cThe administration would rather topple a statewide safety network than let a patient get a cancer screening at a facility that also offers abortion care,\u201d Meetra Mehdizadeh, a Center for Reproductive Rights lawyer, said in an interview.",
      "Planned Parenthood already sued and won a reprieve from a judge, preventing its Medicaid payments cutoff \u2014 at least until July 21 \u2014 while a court considers that case.",
      "Planned Parenthood has warned that the law could put 200 of its affiliates\u2019 roughly 600 clinics across the U.S. at risk of closing.",

      "\u201cI do have to say that this took some persuasion,\u201d said Sen. Todd Young of Indiana in an interview with The Associated Press. The other champion was Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who did not respond to an interview request.",
      "Together, they advocated to remove the provision which, at the high end, would levy a tax of 10% on the investment earnings of foundations with more than $5 billion in assets, up from the current rate of 1.39%.",
      "The move reveals both the power of philanthropic groups, especially conservative ones, to sway legislators and a split in the administration's coalition between those who want to protect the independence of private philanthropy and those who think the sector supports resistance to the president's agenda.",
      "Young said he spoke with leaders or representatives of a dozen foundations in his state to understand what it would mean to increase these taxes on foundation endowments.",
      "Though Young didn't name any specific leaders, Indiana is home to numerous major foundations \u2014 including one of America's largest foundations, the Lilly Endowment, which holds shares in the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and reported assets of almost $80 billion at the end of last year. The Associated Press receives funding from the Lilly Endowment for its coverage of philanthropy and religion.",
      "Young said many in the Republican caucus appreciate the value of the investments private foundations make in their communities.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest here. The target of this excise tax increase was not the vast majority of private foundations. It was a handful of large foundations that are nationally known that have been accused of embracing and perpetuating certain woke policies and agendas,\u201d Young said.",
      "While he didn't specify the specific foundations, Young was tapping into a critique of large progressive foundations brought by politicians like Vice President JD Vance. In a 2021 speech at the conservative think tank The Claremont Institute, Vance attacked foundations who fund movements for social justice and characterized their support for Black Lives Matter groups as \u201cinvesting in racial division.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe should eliminate all of the special privileges that exist for our nonprofit foundation class,\u201d Vance said at the time. \u201cIf you\u2019re spending all your money to teach racism to our children in their schools, why do we give you special tax breaks instead of taxing you more?\u201d",
      "The White House has generally expressed support for that policy view. In an early executive order, Trump asked the attorney general to identify large foundations to investigate for civil rights violations, along with large corporations and universities. So far, the administration has not announced any investigations into foundations, even as the deadline included in the executive order has passed.",
      "Conservative philanthropic groups added their voice to oppose the proposed increase in taxes on foundations' endowment earnings. The Philanthropy Roundtable, which said it supports conservative and free market ideas, led a coalition to send a letter to Senate majority leader Sen. John Thune of Montana and Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, who leads the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "\u201cWe know policies that siphon private dollars away from charities to line the government\u2019s coffers are antithetical to conservative values,\u201d the signatories wrote of the proposed tax on foundation assets.",
      "The legislation also contains a mix of provisions that impact funders, nonprofits and communities. It allows the vast majority of tax filers to take a charitable deduction of up to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for married couples, which advocates believe will increase the amount everyday donors give.",
      "The law also moved forward with a new cap on itemized deductions for the wealthiest tax filers, which advocates think will deter charitable giving. It also creates a new requirement for corporations to donate a minimum of 1% of their taxable income before receiving a tax benefit. Many corporations do not meet that threshold, meaning they may be discouraged from giving at all.",
      "United Philanthropy Forum is a membership organization for foundations, which has long advocated around issues important to the sector. Besides the recent spending bill, they\u2019ve followed executive orders, provisions that would have threatened the tax-exempt status of organizations and cuts to social safety net programs.",
      "Matthew L. Evans, the forum\u2019s vice president of advocacy and external relations, said the forum shifted their strategy several years ago away from defending the interests of the sector to advocating for the communities which private philanthropy serves.",
      "\u201cIt really is an all hands on deck moment because again this is such an unprecedented time for us,\u201d Evans said.",
      "The forum was part of a coalition of nonprofit associations that helped organize a letter pushing back on multiple provisions in the spending bill, which almost 3,000 nonprofits signed on to support.",
      "But one of the most important messages nonprofit advocates were delivering to lawmakers was around the impacts of cuts to social safety net programs, said Kyle Caldwell, who leads the Council of Michigan Foundations. He said his organization has advocated for foundations and the communities they serve in Michigan for decades.",
      "\u201cIf you think about all of the systems that were in place: access to health care, access to education, access to food. All of those really were targeted services to the most vulnerable in our community. That\u2019s where philanthropy invests most. That\u2019s where nonprofits act most,\" he said, adding that the cuts will \"put higher demands on the nonprofit sector, which was already overburdened.\u201d",
      "When asked about concerns over the impact of the cuts, Senator Young from Indiana said he thinks the bill strikes the right balance.",
      "\u201cWhat we have found is that when the economy grows, people give more because they to have more to give,\u201d Young said.",

      "Native American radio stations could face shutdowns if Congress cuts over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Dozens of Native American radio stations across the country vital to tribal communities will be at risk of going off the air if Congress cuts more than $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to industry leaders.",
      "The U.S. Senate is set to vote this week on whether to approve the Department of Government Efficiency's plan to rescind previously approved public broadcasting funding for 2026 and 2027. Fear is growing that most of the 59 tribal radio stations that receive the funding will go dark, depriving isolated populations of news, local events and critical weather alerts. The House already approved the cuts last month.",
      "\u201cFor Indian Country in general, 80% of the communities are rural, and their only access to national news, native story sharing, community news, whatever it is, is through PBS stations or public radio,\u201d said Francene Blythe-Lewis, CEO of the Lincoln, Nebraska-based Native American video programming producer Vision Maker Media. \u201cIf the claw back happens, I would say a good 90% of those stations will cease to exist.\u201d",
      "Local radio plays an outsized role in the lives of many who live in Indigenous communities, where cable television and broadband internet access are spotty, at best, and nonexistent for many. That leaves over-the-air TV stations \u2014 usually a PBS station \u2014 and more often local radio to provide local news, community event details and music by Indigenous artists. Sometimes the news is delivered in Indigenous languages.",
      "\u201cIt means we\u2019re not going to hear our language on the radio,\u201d Blythe-Lewis said.",
      "Flagstaff, Arizona-based Native Public Media, which supports the network of 59 radio stations and three television stations serving tribal nations across the country, said about three dozen of those radio stations that rely heavily on Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding will be the first to go dark if funding is cut for the coming fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.",
      "Loris Taylor, CEO of Native Public Media, said in an op-ed that the tribal stations reach more than 1.5 million people and \u201cmay be the only source of locally relevant news, emergency alerts, public safety announcements, language preservation, health information and election coverage.\u201d",
      "GOP senators are under pressure from President Donald Trump, who promised last week on his Truth Social platform that any Republican who votes against the cuts \u201cwill not have my support or Endorsement.\u201d",
      "Many Republicans say the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, recently defended the cuts as necessary to hack away at the nearly $37 trillion national debt, adding, \u201cIt is critical in restoring trust in government.\u201d",
      "But some Republicans have pushed back, such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who questioned the proposed cuts last month during a Senate committee hearing. She said that while some of the federal money is assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System, most of it goes to locally owned public radio and television stations.",
      "Jaclyn Sallee is president and CEO of Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and KNBA, its radio station in Anchorage, Alaska. Koahnic produces National Native News, a five-minute daily newscast that features headline news from across Indian Country, and Native America Calling, a daily hourlong call-in program, for about 190 stations across the nation. It also produces Indigefi, a music program in Indigenous languages.",
      "KNBA is on Native Public Media's list of those stations that would be most affected by the federal funding cuts \u2014 a concern Sallee confirmed, as 40% of the station's funding comes from CPB.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re really worried about are the rural stations in Alaska where they may be the only station in the community,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people that live there depend on the station for vital weather alerts, emergency alerts; it\u2019s the local hub of the community where people share information. So that is very troublesome because people\u2019s lives are at risk without this service.\u201d",
      "It's currently fishing season in Alaska, she said, \u201cwhich means getting out in the ocean or in rivers and going long distances to subsist, and so they really rely on weather reports.\u201d",
      "Having the news reported in a tribe\u2019s language isn\u2019t just about preserving that language, she said. Sallee spent summers in Nome with her mother\u2019s family. Her grandmother, she said, spoke only Inupiaq.",
      "New Mexico PBS\u2019s signal reaches all but one of the more than 20 tribes and pueblos in the state. It also has signed an agreement with the Navajo Nation, which has the largest reservation of any tribe in the U.S., that allows the tribe to carry the PBS signal and programming on the Navajo Nation Television network, New Mexico PBS general manger Franz Joachim said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no question in my mind that, you know, immediately some stations will pretty much go dark,\u201d Joachim said.",
      "When those first stations fail, it won't take long for others to follow, Joachim said. And as they do, it will mean fewer and fewer stations left to pay membership dues that also help fund all of the stations.",
      "\u201cSo now the whole system starts to fracture,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for me, the federal funding is really about the system as a whole that keeps us in place.\u201d",
      "That funding also helps produce national content that groups like Vision Maker Media produce. Those include Native American documentaries shown on PBS like \u201cMankiller,\u201d the story of Wilma Mankiller who became the first woman elected principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.",
      "Blythe-Lewis compared the potential loss of tribal stations to the country's past attempts to erase Native American cultures, such as through federal boarding schools where Indigenous children were sent for generations to assimilate them into white society and where systemic abuse of Indigenous children was carried out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re erased from public media and therefore invisible and therefore become unknown and unheard of,\u201d she said.",

      "Two milestones revealed this week illustrated the diminishing power of broadcast television in a new media world",
      "NEW YORK -- Two milestones revealed this week illustrate the diminishing power of broadcast television in the media world \u2014 one fueled by the habits of young people and the other by their elders.",
      "During June, viewers spent more time watching streaming services than they did for broadcast and cable television combined. That happened for the first time ever in May, by a fraction of a percentage point, but the Nielsen company said on Tuesday that gap widened considerably in June.",
      "Also, for the third straight week, Nielsen said that Fox News Channel had more viewers in prime-time on weeknights than any of the main the broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox entertainment.",
      "For years, the mantra of media executives was that streaming represented the future for in-home entertainment. Now, that future has clearly arrived.",
      "In June, 46% of Americans' TV time was spent on streaming services, led by YouTube and Netflix. Cable television networks represented 23.4% and broadcast was 18.5%, for a total of just under 42%, Nielsen said. It was the first time broadcast TV had ever slipped below 20% of total TV viewing.",
      "\u201cIt kind of felt like the right time,\u201d said Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen's senior vice president for product strategy and thought leadership. \u201cA lot of people thought it would happen more quickly.\u201d",
      "The driving force in June was school ending for young people, meaning they had more time to watch TV, where Netflix series like \u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d and \u201cSquid Game\u201d were big hits. Roughly two-thirds of people aged 6 to 17 watched streaming ahead of conventional TV, Nielsen said.",
      "In June 2024, the numbers were roughly reversed \u2014 47.7% of people were watching conventional TV in an average minute, with 40.3% logged on to a streaming service.",
      "While the direction is clear, it's not a death knell for conventional TV. June and July are fallow months, and their viewing will increase when football season begins and original episodes of comedies and dramas return, Fuhrer said.",
      "It's also not a strict either-or situation; media companies are doing a better job spreading their content out on different platforms to give viewers a choice, he said. The growth of YouTube, which many consumers can access for free and is a portal for \"traditional\" TV, has also fueled streaming services.",
      "Fox News has occasionally eclipsed the broadcast networks in viewership before, but last week represented the seventh week it has done so in 2025, already more than 2024 and 2023 combined. It averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time on weeknights last week, Nielsen said.",
      "Fox News is also taking advantage of what is traditionally the least-watched time of the year for broadcast networks, when summer nights and barbecues keep people outside. The difference this year is it has won a few weeks outside of the summer, during President Donald Trump's inauguration week in January, for example.",
      "Its audience \u2014 among the oldest of all television networks \u2014 tends to stay pretty steady throughout the year.",

      "The assaults represent the latest chapter of the rebels\u2019 campaign against shipping over the war in Gaza that began with Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 surprise attack in southern Israel.

      "\u201cWe stand convinced that any steps aimed at stabilizing the situation in Yemen and around Yemen should be taken in political and diplomatic ways,\u201d he said.",
      "China\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Geng Shuang said his country abstained because \u201ccertain countries took military action against Yemen, which seriously impacted the Yemeni peace process and exacerbated tensions in the Red Sea.\u201d",

      "A carriage driver is on trial over a horse\u2019s collapse on a Manhattan street",
      "NEW YORK -- A carriage driver went on trial Tuesday over a horse's collapse on a Manhattan street, in a criminal case that encapsulates years of modern-day strife over an old-timey tourist attraction.",
      "Prosecutors say Ian McKeever relentlessly kept driving the horse, Ryder, on an 84-degree (29-degree Celsius) day in August 2022, despite signs that the animal was struggling to pull the carriage before he went down en route back to his barn.",
      "\u201cThe defendant chose to press on, business as usual, and overwork Ryder,\" prosecutor Taylor Maurer told jurors in her opening statement. The horse survived the fall but was euthanized some months later because of health problems.",
      "McKeever, 56, has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor animal cruelty charge. His attorney says the horse was properly cared for, wasn\u2019t overheated, and simply tripped and fell.",
      "\u201cRyder\u2019s fall is heartbreaking, but the evidence in this case is not going to show that Ryder fell because Ian overdrove him,\u201d the lawyer, Raymond Loving, said in his opening statement.",
      "Horse-drawn carriages have plied Central Park and the city's streets for over 150 years. Featured in countless movies and TV shows, they're a quaint attraction for many tourists and a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for activists who have long wanted them banned.",
      "Animal advocates say it's inhumane to have horses navigating Manhattan traffic. Over the years, some horses have gotten startled, run off and collided with cars or other objects. Others besides Ryder have collapsed on the job.",
      "Supporters of horse-drawn carriages see the coaches as a romantic remnant of a bygone New York. They also note that the carriages net tourist dollars and have provided hundreds of jobs to drivers, plus jobs for a glut of farm and racing horses.",
      "\u201cIf they did not come to New York City, most of these horses would be dead,\u201d McKeever told The Associated Press in 2014. He said some of his own carriage horses were going to go to slaughterhouses before he bought them.",
      "Perhaps improbably, horse-drawn carriages became a potent political issue about a decade ago, when mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio campaigned on a promise to eradicate them on his first day in office. The Democrat won in 2013 and got pushback from unions, newspaper editorials and other supporters of horse-drawn carriages. After two years, a compromise plan to limit the carriages' number and range was pulled off the agenda on the eve of a City Council vote.",
      "McKeever has been a carriage horse driver for 30 years. His attorney said Ryder belonged to the defendant's brother.",
      "The horse was outside for over seven hours on Aug. 10, 2022, mostly in Central Park. An onlooker, Caroline Londahl-Smidt, testified Tuesday that the horse appeared to her to be in \u201cmajor distress,\u201d walking slowly up a hill, as McKeever shook the reins and seemed to be trying angrily to speed him up.",
      "Later, the horse collapsed near Times Square during the evening rush hour. Bystander video published by the New York Post showed McKeever snapping the reins at him and telling him to get up.",
      "Ryder rolled onto his right side and laid on the pavement for nearly an hour, occasionally trying to rise as police cooled him with water and ice from nearby restaurants, according to testimony and body camera video from Sgt. Vincent Fontana of the police department's mounted unit. Officers tucked a pillow under the horse's head to protect his right eye from the pavement.",
      "Ultimately, the horse stood, walked into a trailer and was driven back to his stable.",
      "Fontana said McKeever told him the animal was 13, but prosecutors say he was considerably older.",
      "Through questioning, Loving emphasized that the horse's temperature was normal and his breathing was not much faster than normal when Fontana took his vital signs. He did so after officers had started hosing down the animal.",
      "McKeever is expected to testify later in the trial. If convicted, he could face up to a year in jail, though the charge also allows for alternatives such as fines or community service.",

      "The new \"Superman\" film has soared to the top of the box office. It made a $122 million domestically in its\u00a0debut over the weekend.",
      "James Gunn, the director of the movie, has worked on the film for the past three years.",
      "\"Then the movie is released and you're like, 'is the public gonna like it? Are the critics gonna like it? And is it gonna make money?' Fortunately with this one, it went well on all three of those,\" Gunn told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The movie depicts Superman, while still powerful, as more human. An initial image shows him bloodied in the snow. Actor David Corenswet plays Superman in the film.",
      "\"As a child, the reason I liked Batman better than Superman was because Superman was just too strong at times,\" Gunn explained. \"I think that this is, we're building a whole universe of characters and I didn't want to have one guy who was so much stronger than anybody else that, you know, a guy with a bow and arrow didn't matter.\"",
      "Gunn also dove into Superman's relationship with Lois Lane, played by Rachel Brosnahan, saying Lane was more cynical and less idealistic than Superman.",
      "\"Lois is a journalist to her core and \u2026 what's her high key value? It's truth. What's Superman's key value? It's life. \u2026 Those are two really important things, but they aren't always, you know, they don't always go together so well,\" he said.",
      "Gunn also delved into Superman's status as an immigrant, its impact and the importance of kindness.",
      "\"For me, the center of it was about kindness in a world that isn't kind. There's no doubt that this story was created by the children of immigrants by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938.\"",
      "He used an example from the film where Superman shows compassion for the character, Lex Luthor, comparing it to everyday life, \"No matter what our beliefs are, if Superman can show Lex Luthor kindness, the guy who wants nothing more than to kill him, why can't we do it to a neighbor who has a different set of political beliefs than we do.\"",

      "Bestselling author Martin Cruz Smith (Nov. 3, 1942-July 11, 2025) was a reporter briefly after college, and also worked as a Good Humor man. \"That was the best,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002. \"I discovered that one other thing I could do besides sell stories was sell Popsicles.\"",
      "He wrote spy novels, westerns and speculative fiction under a variety of pseudonyms and, at the behest of his agent, added Cruz to his name when his 1977 thriller \"Nightwing\" was published. He became an international name with 1981's \"Gorky Park,\" the story of a triple murder in Moscow, and the Russian detective, Arkady Renko, who risks his life to solve it. Rich in mood and gripping in narrative, the book starred a protagonist who stood at odds with his mother country and the political apparatus consuming it.",
      "An international blockbuster, it inspired a film starring William Hurt. But the Soviets were not amused; Smith was blacklisted from the U.S.S.R. \"I could not get back in at that point. I was persona non grata,\" he said.",
      "But he worked his way onto a Soviet factory ship in the Bering Sea and somehow charmed the captain. Smith's brief stay aboard the Sulak, out of Vladivostok. became the basis of his sequel to \"Gorky Park,\" \"Polar Star.\"",

      "Smith worked to keep himself interested as a writer because, he said, \"writing is so boring. I mean, you're up there alone, nobody's there, and sometimes you kind of swivel round just to see if anybody showed up, and no one ever shows up; it's just you.

While he was preparing for the release of his \"December 6\" \u2014 a non-Renko novel set in Tokyo on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor \u2014 Smith said he could feel the presence of his most famous character lurking over his shoulder: \"You know, I can feel him sort of pacing; you know, smoking cigarettes and pacing \u2026 'When is he going to be done with this Japanese book and we can get back to work?'\""

    "story": [
      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \"if they want her.\"",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Mr. Trump's involvement in politics.

    "story": [
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoride as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.",
      "And according to\u00a0the American Dental Association, \"70 years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\"",
      "\"If that's the case, they need to individually go out to each water district and sell it to the people there, and let them make their own water decisions,\" King said.",
      "At least 19 states have considered legislation to remove, ban or make fluoride optional in public drinking water this year. One of fluoride's most prominent critics is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "In the latest skirmish over science, fluoride opponents argue that at high levels, it can lead to kidney and liver damage and lower IQs in children.",

    "summary": "Americans are starting back-to-school shopping earlier this year out of concern over tariffs, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "The back-to-school season may seem at least a month away on the calendar, but for a majority of American families, it's already begun.",
      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",
      "Four in five shoppers said they were planning their shopping around July back-to-school sales to maximize their budgets, the NRF report found.",
      "Retailers focus on sales",
      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",
      "Walmart on Tuesday\u00a0announced\u00a0lower prices on 14 of the most popular back-to-school supplies compared with last year. A survey by the retail giant found that 70% of its customers said they planned to spend more time this year searching for discounts.",
      "\"Regardless of income, families want to ensure their students are set up for success,\" said Phil Rist, executive vice president of strategy at analytics firm Prosper, said in a statement. \"They are cutting back in other areas, using buy now, pay later or buying used or refurbished items to have everything they need for the school year.\"",

      "The Consumer Price Index in June rose 2.7% on an annual basis, a sign inflation around the U.S. is creeping up after declining earlier this year.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.7% last month, higher than last month's rate of 2.4%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. June's reading is the highest since February, when the CPI rose 2.8% on an annual basis.",

      "Food prices rose 3% on an annual basis last month, higher than the overall inflation rate. Items that have seen big cost increases since last June include eggs, which are up 27.3%, roasted coffee, which is up over 12.7%, and ground beef, which is up 10.3%.",
      "Meanwhile, energy was a large source of inflation, with energy prices rising 0.9% on a month-over-month basis. That follows a 1% drop in May.",

      "Early signs of tariff impact",
      "June's CPI reading indicates that tariffs might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories. Everyday items, from produce to apparel, could be susceptible to new levies if they are imported from abroad. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month predicted that tariffs could start to push up prices in the second half of the year.",
      "President Trump recently announced he would issue a flurry of new tariffs on over 20 countries, which he said will take effect on Aug. 1, extending the deadline of a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs that ended earlier this month.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge, said in a report that certain categories exposed to tariffs \u2014 ranging from apparel, home furnishings and appliances to footwear and toys \u2014 saw some upward pricing pressure. But other products vulnerable to higher levies, such as vehicles, remained stable.",
      "EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco estimates that roughly a third of the June rise in the CPI is attributable to higher tariffs.",
      "The muted CPI data from previous months indicates that companies have taken steps to offset the costs of tariffs, largely shielding consumers from price shocks. However, that could change.",
      "\"Strategies used by companies to avoid passing on cost increases to consumers are not eternal,\" Daco noted in a report.",
      "July Fed cut unlikely",
      "Despite the June increase, Wall Street analysts say inflation mostly remains in check.",
      "\"While today's CPI release showed some early signs of tariff impact, on the whole underlying inflation remained muted,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Price pressures, however, are expected to strengthen over the summer and the July and August CPI reports will be important hurdles to clear.\"",
      "Analysts say the latest inflation data points to the Federal Reserve standing pat on interest rates at its meeting later this month. Investors see a more than 97% probability that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate in its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% when officials meet on July 29-30, according to The CME Group's FedWatch\u00a0tool.",
      "\"Today's inflation report all but dashes any remaining hopes that the Fed may cut interest rates at its meeting later this month,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email. \"However, if subsequent inflation readings reiterate the rise in inflation, it could jeopardize future rate cuts as well.\"",

    "summary": "The ruling targets a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical debt from 15 million credit reports.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

      "But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell \u2014 who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump \u2014 \"Mr. Too Late.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:01:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",
      "\"After a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that House Speaker Mike Johnson telephoned into the meeting and \"looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible.\"",

    "summary": "The latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development.",
    "story": [
      "Aaron J. Snoswell is a senior research fellow in AI Accountability at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "Grok, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embedded in X (formerly Twitter) and built by Elon Musk's company xAI, is back in the headlines after\u00a0calling itself \"MechaHitler\" and producing pro-Nazi remarks.",
      "The developers have\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the \"inappropriate posts\" and \"taken action to ban hate speech\" from Grok's posts on X. Debates about AI bias have been revived, too.",
      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAIMusk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAI",
      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

      "\"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday at the White House, laying out a new ultimatum and deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire to end its war in Ukraine.",
      "The levies, he said, would be applied as \"secondary tariffs\" \u2014 not targeting Russia directly, but designed to increase Moscow's economic pain by pressuring its trade partners to stop buying or selling products in the energy, agriculture and weapons sectors with Russia.",
      "China and India became the world's first and second biggest importers of Russian oil in 2023 after Western sanctions were imposed against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The top post had previously been held by the 27-nation European Union.",
      "China and India, Asia's two biggest economies, now collectively import an estimated 85% to 90% of the seaborne crude oil sold by Russia's state-managed energy companies, which make up the bulk of its total exports.",
      "After launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin renegotiated prices with its trade partners, offering steep discounts on Russian oil compared to U.S. and European crude. NATO member Turkey is another major importer of Russian oil and natural gas.",
      "In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates \u2014   while not a major energy importer itself \u2014   serves as a financial hub for the international trade in Russian oil. Dubai is also a safe haven for Russian capital and oligarchs.",

      "A flurry of tariff threats by President Trump leaves U.S. consumers and businesses in limbo ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline to deploy the import duties against more than 50 countries around the world, according to economists and trade experts.",
      "\"Nobody knows whether these are threats or whether they will become policy, so it seems like everyone has become desensitized to them,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that uncertainty over U.S. tariffs leaves companies in \"a very dense fog.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",
      "The White House last week also said it plans to impose a 50% levy on copper imports by Aug. 1, raising concerns about higher costs for electronics, cars and numerous other products that use the metal.",
      "Heat on Russia and Brazil",
      "In a separate development that illustrates the White House's willingness to use tariffs to accomplish its aims beyond trade, Mr. Trump is threatening sharply higher tariffs as he tries to tamp down conflict in Ukraine.

      "In another case of hitching trade policy to other foreign policy priorities, Mr. Trump said last week that the U.S. would slap a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",

      "\"How do you negotiate with someone when you don't know what they want?\" he said. \"One day, [President Trump] says they are about trade deficits, the next day it's about raising revenue, the next it's about stimulating American industry \u2014 then it's a bargaining tool.

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 23:41:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

    "summary": "Tesla faces questions over the alleged involvement of its Autopilot system in a 2019 crash that killed Florida college student Naibel Benavides Leon",
    "story": [
      "Tesla heads to federal court in Miami on Monday to defend its Autopilot system in a wrongful death case involving the death of a 22-year-old college student.",
      "The lawsuit, originally filed in April 23, 2021, in the 11th Judicial Court of Florida in Miami-Dade County, builds on previous cases involving Tesla's Autopilot system. The plaintiffs, Dillon Angulo, and the family of Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed in the accident, are requesting punitive damages and compensation for medical costs and other expenses.",
      "The fatal crash took place in April 2019 when a Model S Tesla equipped with the Autopilot technology struck a parked vehicle in Key Largo, Florida, killing Leon and gravely injuring Angulo.",
      "The trial will be a major test for the EV maker, which has had to contend with slumping sales and a hit to its stock price after CEO Elon Musk spearheaded the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He. has since stepped back from leading DOGE.",
      "The lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the case did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Autopilot's reputation at stake",
      "According to recent court filings connected to the case, Tesla owner George McGee had the Autopilot function of his 2019 Tesla Model S activated as he was driving on a two-lane rural road in Key Largo on April 25, 2019. McGee dropped his phone as he was approaching an intersection, and lost sight of the road as he bent down to pick it up, court documents state.",
      "In that moment, McGee's car allegedly plowed through the T-shaped intersection at over 60 miles per hour, failing to brake before crashing into the side of a Chevrolet Tahoe truck parked on the side of the road. The accident killed Naibel Benavides Leon, 22, and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, who were standing by the truck, which he owned.",
      "At issue is whether the car's Autopilot system was defective and contributed to the death of Benavides. In a court filing, Todd Poses, one of the plaintiff's lawyer, claims that design defects in the car's Autopilot system failed to detect obstacles, such as the Chevy Tahoe, resulting in Benavides' death.",
      "Tesla's argument",
      "In its motion for summary judgment, filed on June 26, Tesla argues that the Autopilot feature \"did not make the car 'self-driving'\" and that McGee was aware \"that it was still [his] responsibility to operate the vehicle safely even with Autopilot activate.\"",
      "Said Tesla in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch:",
      "\"The evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla's Autopilot technology. Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. To his credit, he took responsibility for his actions because he was searching for his dropped cell phone while also pressing the accelerator, speeding and overriding the car's system at the time of the crash. In 2019 when this occurred, no crash avoidance technology existed that could have prevented this tragic accident.\"",
      "Mary Cummings, a professor of engineering at George Mason University and an expert on advanced driver-assistance systems, is likely to testify at the trial, documents from the lawsuit's docket indicate. McGee, the driver of the car, is also expected to testify.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:47:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",

Musk has since emerged as a sharp critic of that legislation, even floating the idea of launching a third political party.",
      "Despite the rift, xAI has continued to expand its government work. The new offering includes custom national security tools, AI-powered science and health applications, and cleared engineering support for classified environments.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok generated antisemitic responses to user prompts and referenced Hitler  as part of what the company called an effort to make the model \"less politically correct.\" Hours later, Musk wrote in a post on X that \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",
      "The posts were later deleted and xAI said it \"quickly\" patched the issue. One day later, xAI launched an upgraded version of Grok it described as a major leap forward. Musk also announced that Grok would be used in Teslas.",

      "Exports climbed 5.8% from a year earlier, up from a 4.8% rise in May. Imports also recovered, growing 1.1% in the first increase so far this year, according to customs data released Monday.",
      "Exports to the United States fell 16%, but that was less than half the 34.5% drop seen in May, as some companies rush to\u00a0pre-order inventory\u00a0before the August expiration of a 90-day tariff truce.",
      "After U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of up to 245% on imports from China and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, the two sides agreed to a truce to allow time for talks.",
      "The retailers and other importers that had largely halted shipments of shoes, clothes, toys, and other items due to new tariffs then resumed imports from China.",
      "But preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress and sudden changes in policy have raised uncertainty for companies trying to plan ahead.",
      "China trade growth",
      "In the meantime, the Trump administration has hiked tariffs on imports from China by 30%, pending an Aug. 12 deadline for reverting to the higher tariffs Washington and Beijing have delayed for now.",
      "The recovery in trade is expected to help boost economic growth in the April to June quarter. The Chinese government is due to report those figures on Tuesday.",
      "Still, the outlook is less upbeat, noted Zichun Huang of Capital Economics, noting that \"tariffs are likely to remain high and Chinese manufacturers face growing constraints on their ability to rapidly expand global market share by slashing prices.",
      "\"We therefore expect export growth to slow over the coming quarters, weighing on economic growth,\" Huang said in a report.",
      "Data for the first six months of the year showed that while the trade war with the U.S. heated up following Trump's return to the White House, China's global trade kept growing.",

    "summary": "Most European markets took a hit as trading resumed in the wake of President Trump's latest tariff threats, and as the EU keeps hoping for a deal.",
    "story": [
      "European markets mostly fell Monday as investors digested President Trump's latest trade war salvos, which saw him threaten to hit the European Union and Mexico with 30% tariffs starting on August 1. Mr. Trump's threat came after a series of announcements last week that included warnings of a possible 50% levy on all copper imports and all goods from Brazil, 35% levies on Canadian goods, and a possible 200% tariff on imported pharmaceuticals.",
      "In announcing his latest intentions on Saturday, Mr. Trump cited Mexico's role in illicit drugs flowing into the United States and a trade imbalance with the European Union.",
      "The move threw months of painstaking talks with Brussels into disarray.",
      "European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has insisted the EU still wants to reach an accord with the U.S. On Sunday, the bloc delayed its planned retaliation for separate U.S. duties on steel and aluminum. EU officials had threatened in May to impose tariffs on U.S. goods worth around $117 billion, including cars and planes, if talks fail, from July 14.",
      "Von der Leyen said Sunday that Mr. Trump's letter showed \"that we have until the first of August\" to negotiate.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding: \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",
      "In April, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, quickly pausing them for three months to negotiate deals. As that 90 day period ended this week, Mr. Trump started sending tariff letters to leaders, but he pushed back the date of implementation of the threatened levies until August, The Associated Press reported.",
      "The EU's trade chief, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said he planned to speak with his U.S. counterparts on Monday.",
      "\"I'm absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,\" \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told journalists in Brussels. \"I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.\"",
      "He noted that the EU was also \"doubling down on efforts to open new markets\" beyond the United States.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron backed efforts to reach an agreement that \"reflects the respect that trade partners such as the European Union and the United States owe each other,\" but he urged the bloc to \"step up the preparation of credible countermeasures\" in the event the two sides fail to reach an agreement.",
      "Shares fell in Frankfurt and Paris, though London saw prices tick higher.",
      "In Asia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Manila, Bangkok and Jakarta all rose, while Tokyo, Sydney, Taipei, Mumbai and Wellington edged down.",
      "Bitcoin hit a new record high of $123,205.",
      "\"It is hard to say whether the muted market response over the week is best characterised by resilience or complacency,\" National Australia Bank's Taylor Nugent said. \"But it is difficult to price the array of headlines purportedly defining where tariffs will sit from 1 August when negotiations are ongoing.\"",
      "Data showed Chinese exports jumped more than expected in June after Washington and Beijing agreed a tentative deal to lower levies on each other. That included a 32.4% surge in shipments to the U.S., which had dropped in May.",
      "Traders were also keeping a nervous eye on the Federal Reserve as Mr. Trump continued to berate boss Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates soon enough, saying Sunday \"I hope he quits,\" and \"he should quit.\"",

    "summary": "People are turning to AI dating assistants for help in crafting wittier, more conversational messages to attract romantic partners on apps.",
    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The millions of Americans with student loans, who have already experienced whiplash in federal policy since the pandemic, must again brace for change.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump signed into law on July 4 overhauls the federal student loan system by reducing the number of repayment plan options down to two from seven and capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education.",
      "Here's how the new budget law will affect people with federal student loans.",
      "Repayment plan options",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out a number of existing federal student loan repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR.",
      "Current borrowers enrolled in programs to be eliminated will have until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. For the 7.7 million Americans enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan, interest collection will resume on Aug. 1, the Department of Education\u00a0announced\u00a0Wednesday.",
      "Beginning on July 1, 2026, new student loan borrowers will choose between one of two plans: a standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. The standard repayment plan will allow student loan borrowers to make fixed payments over the course of 10 to 25 years.",
      "That approach \"condenses a maze of loan options into two,\" simplifying the repayment process, according to the White House.",
      "The Repayment Assistance Plan will allow borrowers to pay 1% to 10% of their income on a monthly basis, for up to 30 years, Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. That's a longer timeline than current IDR plans, which\u00a0are currently either 20 or 25 years.",
      "After the 30-year mark, the borrower's remaining loan balance will be canceled, as is currently the case after an individual's repayment window ends.",
      "The five-year payment extension on income-based payments concerns Ba\u00f1ez, who said \"borrowers are going to be forced to be in repayment for even longer,\" she said.",
      "However, Sarah Reber, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, thinks the binary repayment options a \"huge improvement\" from a policy design perspective. The current system is confusing for borrowers given all the options from which they have to choose, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill gives families the freedom to choose the best education for their children while reforming a broken federal loan system to promote responsibility, affordability and opportunity,\" the White House said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Pell Grants",
      "The new law tightens eligibility rules for the Pell Grant program, the largest source of federal aid for low-income students. From 2021-2022, an estimated 92% of Pell Grant recipients had a total family income at or below $60,000,\u00a0according to Congress.gov.",
      "Under the law, students who receive a full scholarship from a college or university will no longer be eligible for additional funding through the Pell Grant program.",
      "By contrast, the law expands Pell Grant eligibility for students in workforce training programs. Previously, Pell Grants could only be used to pay for workforce training courses of less than 600 hours and 15 weeks, shutting out many short-term programs.",
      "That will enable \"Pell Grants to be used for short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support Americans who choose a career or technical education path for career advancement,\" the White House said.",
      "The budget law also increases scrutiny of the Student Aid Index, which is used to determine the size of an individual's federal aid eligibility. As a result, higher-income families will have a harder time getting Pell Grant funding, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP).",
      "Borrowing caps",
      "The new law sets borrowing caps on certain loans beginning July 1, 2026.",
      "Parent PLUS loans \u2014 federal loans available for parents of dependent undergraduate students \u2014 will now be restricted to $20,000 a year and a total cap of $65,000. That's a change from the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid an individual receives.",
      "The new law also does away with\u00a0Grad PLUS loans,\u00a0which help people finance higher education degrees. Starting July 1, 2026, new students will no longer be able to apply for the loans. However, current borrowers will be grandfathered and still allowed to access the loans, according to EdSource.",
      "With the elimination of Grad PLUS loans, graduate students in need of federal tuition assistance will have to take out Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Those seeking unsubsidized federal loans for professional degrees, such as law or medicine, will be restricted to $50,000 per year and a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in nonprofessional areas, such as history or philosophy, will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Economic hardship, unemployment deferment",
      "Currently, student loan borrowers can apply for up to three years of deferment based on economic hardship or unemployment, according to the Federal Student Aid website.",
      "Starting July 1, 2026, the new law eliminates deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship. For example, someone who falls behind on the bills because of job loss would no longer qualify to defer student loan payments, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "According to the White House, the changes to the deferment rules will streamline the process while also better protecting students and taxpayers.",

    "summary": "Unemployment is rising among recent college grads as employers turn to artificial intelligence to handle entry-level work.",
    "story": [
      "The rise of generative AI is making it harder for recent college graduates to get a foothold on the corporate ladder as they start their careers.",
      "Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to young grads have declined 15%, while the number of applications per job has surged 30%, according to data from Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z workers.",
      "Although people fresh out of college often struggle to land entry-level positions in their chosen field, \"there are early warning signs\" that AI is taking jobs away from the least experienced\u00a0 workers, Doug Calidas, senior vice president of government affairs for Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on emerging technologies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The unemployment rate for recent college graduates being unusually high seems relevant,\" he said.",
      "As of March, the U.S. unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 through 27 was 5.8%, considerably higher than the nation's overall 4% jobless rate at the time,\u00a0according\u00a0to the New York Federal Reserve.",
      "To be sure, most recent college grads are finding work, Calidas emphasized, adding that the latest job figures point to a \"deterioration,\" not a collapse, in opportunities for young people.",
      "Still, \"It's tough for students who feel like they have done the right thing their whole lives \u2014 they went into STEM careers or computer science because they expected software hiring to grow and grow, and that may not happen,\" he said.",
      "Just ask Michael Macaluso, 22, who this year earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Connecticut. Despite applying for roughly 200 positions, he has yet to land a job in his chosen field. For now, he's working as an assistant pool director at the Lake Isle Country Club in Eastchester, New York, his hometown.",
      "\"I was told by a lot of people, that I was going to get a job right out of college,\" he told CBS News' Ali Bauman. \"And then all of a sudden, there's no jobs.\"",
      "AI redefining the entry-level job",
      "Experts say that because AI is currently best at the kind of rote, repetitive tasks that are a staple of entry-level work, the very nature of what such roles consist of is likely to change.",
      "\"The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,\" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it.\"",
      "Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.",
      "Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.",
      "\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.",
      "By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.",
      "\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a\u00a0 higher skill level.\"",
      "New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.",
      "The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.",
      "\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-copper-tariff-price/",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 07:10:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Manufacturers and construction companies \u2014 as well as consumers \u2014 would face higher prices if the U.S. jacks up tariffs on copper, analysts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports targets a vital metal that is widely used in many products and industries. That could lead to higher prices for everything from appliances and electronics to cars and home repairs, economists and industry experts said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the copper duties late Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, saying they will take effect Aug 1.",
      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",
      "The sectoral tariff threats come after Mr. Trump this week announced stiff new tariff rates on 20 nations\u00a0that have not yet reached trade agreements with the U.S and that he said would take effect on Aug. 1. He outlined the new rates, posted in nearly identical letters on Truth Social, as a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" levies was\u00a0set to expire\u00a0on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "As it seeks to ramp up deportations, the Trump administration has sent some migrants to far-flung places that aren't their home countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Tuesday said it deported a group of men convicted of violent crimes to the small African country of Eswatini, in its latest expansion of deportations to far-flung places that are not deportees' home countries.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the deportees hailed from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen, and had been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. The men's criminal records included convictions for murder, homicide and child rape, McLaughlin added.",
      "The deported men, McLaughlin said, are \"so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.\"",
      "In a statement, the government of Eswatini said the five deportees were transferred to correctional facilities, alongside \"similar offenders.\" The government said it would work to facilitate the men's return to their countries of origin.",
      "Eswatini is a landlocked country in southern Africa that was formerly known as Swaziland. The tiny nation is slightly bigger in size than Connecticut, has around 1.2 million residents and is ruled by a king.",
      "CBS News reported in early May that the U.S. had asked Eswatini, alongside other countries in Africa, Asia and Europe, to receive deportees who are not their own citizens. The talks are part of a larger, aggressive effort by the Trump administration to persuade as many countries as possible \u2014 regardless of their human rights record \u2014 to accept citizens of other nations, including criminals.",
      "President Trump's administration has already used agreements to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador; migrants from Africa and Asia to Costa Rica and Panama; and eight convicted criminals from Asian and Latin American countries to conflict-ridden South Sudan.",
      "Trump administration officials have persuaded other nations, like Honduras and Kosovo, to accept deportees from other countries, though those agreements have not been fully implemented yet. U.S. officials have approached other nations \u2014 including Moldova, Libya and Rwanda \u2014 to strike similar deals.",
      "Historically, the U.S. has sought to deport unauthorized immigrants to third countries if they hail from nations where it's difficult or impossible to deport them, such as those that limit or entirely reject U.S. deportations.",
      "The practice is controversial. Critics say some of the third countries that the Trump administration has turned to \u2014 like South Sudan \u2014 are unsafe, and the deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador has sparked legal and humanitarian concerns since the deportees have been held incommunicado at a notorious mega-prison, despite many of them lacking any apparent criminal record.",
      "The administration's campaign to increase deportations to third-party countries gained a major legal victory last month, when the Supreme Court suspended a ruling by a federal judge in Boston that had required the U.S. to give detainees a certain degree of notice and due process before any deportation to a place that was not their country of origin.",
      "That now-suspended lower court order had required officials to give detainees and their lawyers notice of the third country the government wanted to remove them to, as well as a chance to contest their deportation, including by raising fears of being harmed or tortured in that nation.",
      "Soon after the Supreme Court's orders, the administration issued guidance aimed at expediting deportations to third countries by making it harder for would-be deportees to contest their deportation from the U.S.",
      "The directive, authored by acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, said detainees with final orders of deportation can be deported to third-party countries, without any notice or further proceedings, if those nations make \"credible\" assurances to the U.S. that they will not persecute or torture the deportees.",
      "If those assurances are not received or are not deemed credible, Lyons' memo instructs ICE officials to give detainees 24-hour notice of the agency's intention to deport them to a third country. But the guidance says ICE officials can give just 6 hours of notice in \"exigent circumstances,\" so long as the detainees are given \"reasonable means and opportunity\" to talk to an attorney.",
      "During those notice periods, detainees will have the burden of expressing fear of being harmed in a third country to try to contest their deportation. ICE officials will not affirmatively ask detainees about any potential fears, the Lyons memo says.",

      "One of the air rescues came on July 4 when two Guard helicopters evacuated 130 children from Camp Mystic, a summer camp severely impacted by floods that led to the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors.",
      "The 130 rescued the day of the flood by the guard were evacuated from Camp Mystic and taken to higher ground, according to Captain Connor Garrison, who led one of the aircraft and recounted the mission to Nordhaus and Abbott.",
      "\"I appreciate you, I couldn't be prouder,\" Abbott told Garrison and other members of the Guard.",
      "The Texas National Guard is receiving support from other states like Arkansas, Arizona and North Dakota, which are providing additional personnel or equipment.

      "\"I think he's terrible,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. \"You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a \u2014 nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality.\"",
      "\"I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,\" he said, referring to the building renovation.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,\" the president said June 12.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike.",
      "Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and a \"numbskull\" in a Truth Social post last month.",
      "Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022.",
      "A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said the ongoing controversy over his administration's handling of information related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is a \"Hoax\" and \"bulls***.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the ongoing controversy over his administration's handling of information related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is a \"Hoax\" and \"bulls***,\" criticizing members of his own party who are calling for more transparency as \"weaklings.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, the president compared the uproar over the Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein files to past controversies, like the investigation into his 2016 campaign's possible ties to Russia and Hunter Biden's laptop.",
      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue. Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country's history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "In a meeting at the White House later in the morning, the president reiterated his statement, telling reporters \"they're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.\"",
      "\"I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy, the best we've ever had, and all of the things we've done, including the Middle East. I mean, you see it. Instead, they want to talk about the Epstein hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrats' work. They're stupid people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's statements highlighted the deep divisions in his party over the handling of the Epstein case, including among some of his strongest supporters.",
      "The current controversy began last week, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review of the evidence against Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019. The department said the review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "The memo was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have long called for more transparency about the Epstein files, which they believe might implicate other powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.",
      "The review also exposed internal divisions within the administration itself. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",
      "Prominent Democrats have pressured their GOP colleagues to push for more transparency from the administration, so far unsuccessfully. Two procedural maneuvers in the House that would have required the administration to reveal more evidence about the Epstein case failed to overcome GOP opposition earlier this week.",
      "But Mr. Trump's supporters in conservative media and his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are continuing to call for the administration to release more of what the government knows about the Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",
      "Other Republicans have called on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on charges related to sex trafficking, to testify before Congress. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said that senators \"ought to call her in the Judiciary Committee, put it under oath and have her testify.\"",
      "The president has tried to tamp down the controversy within his party since last week, saying on Tuesday that the Epstein case is \"pretty boring stuff.\"",
      "\"I don't understand it, why they would be so interested. He's [been] dead for a long time, he was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is,\" he told reporters. \"I really don't, and the credible information has been given.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate kicked off what's expected to be another lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon as Congress works to deliver on President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in spending by Friday.",
      "The Senate narrowly advanced the request late Tuesday. Three Republicans opposed the package and Vice President JD Vance had to cast the two tie-breaking votes to move it forward.",
      "The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it has faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans have opposed slashing foreign aid and public broadcasting funding.",
      "Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The Senate's decision to consider amendments to the package means the House will need to approve the final Senate version.",
      "The rescissions request targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS.",
      "Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of the main concerns of Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the \"small modification.\"",
      "When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters, \"we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did.\"",
      "\"We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,\" Johnson added.",
      "But the change did not satisfy Collins, who voted against advancing the package. Collins was joined by two other Republicans senators: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.",
      "The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented.",
      "\"To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,\" Collins said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight.",
      "\"I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,\" she said. \"We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that.\"",
      "Cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, was another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating \"without interruption.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said he would vote for the package, but expected that Congress would later have to try to fix some of the cuts once they determine the impacts.",
      "\"I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,\" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago \u2014 the so-called big, beautiful bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:01:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",

    "summary": "CBS News analysis finds that up to $63 million has been raised for Mr. Trump's future presidential library so far from legal settlements alone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's efforts to direct millions of dollars to his future presidential library has drawn fresh attention to a lack of visibility into the identities or potential interests of the donors who are funding it, a longstanding Washington concern facing past presidents from both parties.",
      "Two prominent Senate Democrats say they are preparing to introduce a bill Wednesday that would regulate fundraising for presidential libraries, according to documents shared with CBS News.",
      "\"Donald Trump is using his presidential library as a tool for bribery while he is still in office,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who is introducing the legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut.",
      "\"Many of the donations to Trump's future library are coming straight from companies and special interests that need a favor from Trump,\" Warren said. \"Right now there are no rules.\"",
      "The effort was spurred by a series of announcements about gifts to the Trump library, including an opulently appointed Boeing 747\u00a0given to the U.S. Air Force by the\u00a0Qatari royal family for the president's use, after which it would be donated to the library for Mr. Trump's post-presidency.",
      "The proceeds of four large legal settlements with the president are also reportedly bound for his library fund. The multimillion-dollar settlements stem from Mr. Trump's lawsuits against Meta, ABC News, X (formerly Twitter) and Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The funds from the four settlements alone could total up to $63 million, according to a CBS News review of news reports and court documents.",
      "Sens. Warren and Blumenthal, along with three House members, Reps. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), are proposing several measures to restrict fundraising for presidential libraries. Among them is a contribution cap of $10,000 per person while the president is still serving in office.",
      "The legislation also proposes quarterly disclosures for all donations of $200 or more, and imposes a two-year \"cooling off\" period after the end of their term during which a president cannot accept donations from foreign nationals, federal government contractors or individuals seeking presidential pardons. Finally, the bill also explicitly bars the use of library donations for personal expenses.",
      "\"Right now, there are basically no rules,\" said Warren. \"The settlements show everyone who has business pending in front of the federal government, that if they've got enough money and can funnel it to Donald Trump through his future presidential library, they might receive better treatment from the US government.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Funding is largely opaque and unregulated",
      "The total amount raised for the Trump library to date is likely far greater than the amounts visible through the president's publicly announced legal settlements. For instance, funds leftover from the $239 million raised by the Trump-Vance inaugural committee \u2014 including millions from tech companies and CEOs such as Amazon, OpenAI, Apple and Uber \u2014 were expected to be redirected to the library, according to multiple news reports. It's unclear how much of those funds have already been transferred. Donations to inaugural funds are required to be reported publicly, whereas presidential libraries are under no such obligation.",
      "The $400 million jet the Trump administration accepted from Qatar in May is also slated to be transferred to the Trump library shortly before he leaves office.",
      "Other than those instances, the funding for the private foundations that support presidential libraries is largely opaque and unregulated, experts said.",
      "\"No one outside the organization knows who contributes to presidential library funds,\" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer who advises tax exempt organizations. \"That information is provided to the IRS, but is not made public.\"",
      "While campaign funds have historically been tightly regulated under a series of laws passed after the Watergate scandal, there are no restrictions on donations to presidential libraries, Kappel said. While in office, presidents can solicit unlimited library donations from anyone \u2014 including foreign nationals, individuals seeking presidential pardons and corporations with federal contracts.",
      "\"The lack of transparency could raise the appearance of impropriety,\" said Kappel. \"No one will know who is making donations to the presidential library while the president is still in office and making government policy.\"",
      "Trustees of the two Trump library organizations and the Trump Organization did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The Obama Presidential Foundation, which oversees the development of former President Barack Obama's library\u00a0in Chicago, was founded\u00a0in January 2014, a year after Obama's second term began. The foundation said it would disclose all donors and donations over $200 on a quarterly basis on their website in an effort to increase transparency. It was estimated in June 2021 that the center will cost roughly $700 million to construct.",
      "President George W. Bush's library foundation began fundraising efforts in the spring of 2009, after he left office. The foundation did not publicly disclose its donors. The cost of that effort clocked in at $250 million. The George W. Bush Presidential Center, on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, opened in 2013.",
      "The first presidential library was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938. Since then, presidential libraries are built and maintained with a mix of private and federal funds. Typically the library itself is constructed with private donations, and occasionally with support from local government or university partners. The library is then transferred to the federal government and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, which oversees the preservation of presidential documents and has a congressionally appropriated budget for maintaining the library structures.",
      "Two nonprofits behind the Trump library",
      "In the last year, the Trump family and associates have established two funds for presidential library donations, according to incorporation records reviewed by CBS News. Both are incorporated as nonprofits in Florida.",
      "The first, the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc., was created in December 2024, before President Trump was sworn in, and shortly after ABC announced it would donate $15 million to the future Trump library to settle a defamation claim the president brought against the network. According to incorporation documents, the fund was established by Jacob Roth, a Florida-based attorney who also filed the paperwork for both the Trump Vance Inauguration Committee Inc. and the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee Inc. in November. According to incorporation documents for the organization, the purpose of the fund is to \"to preserve and steward the legacy of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency.\"",
      "A few months later, in May, a second nonprofit was incorporated under the name Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation. There are three listed trustees: Eric Trump; Tiffany Trump's husband, Michael Boulos; and James Kiley, a New York attorney who represented Mr. Trump between 2020 and 2022 during one of his legal battles against his niece, Mary Trump.",
      "This foundation was created to \"steward, preserve, and celebrate the legacy and historical record of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency,\" according to filings.",
      "There may not be rules for what money can go into a presidential library fund, but there are strict rules for how nonprofit funds can be spent.",
      "As nonprofit 501(c)(3)s, tax laws prohibit the use of funds from a presidential library for personal benefit. The IRS is in charge of enforcing all conflict-of-interest laws for nonprofits, although experts are skeptical about the agency's political will to enforce those provisions.",
      "\"501(c)(3)s are supposed to be used for charitable purposes. To the extent funds are being used beyond that, and outside the scope of a presidential library, that's something the IRS would have to look into,\" said Viriginia Canter, who served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "There is no indication that Mr. Trump or his family are using funds for the libraries for personal expenses.",
      "Past library controversies",
      "The Trump family is not the first to face criticism over donations to a library fund while in office. President Bill Clinton faced significant pushback after he pardoned billionaire businessman Marc Rich, who'd fled to Switzerland after he was indicted in 1983 on more than 50 counts of wire fraud, racketeering, trading with Iran during an embargo and evading more than $48 million in U.S. income taxes.",
      "Clinton's pardon \u2014 which was issued just hours before he left office in January 2001 \u2014 faced scrutiny even from some of his closest allies, who said Rich's pardon appeared to have been bought. They pointed to the $450,000 donation Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, bestowed to the Clinton library foundation and the additional $100,000 she donated to Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign.",
      "And in 2008, a GOP lobbyist with ties to the Bush administration was caught on video allegedly soliciting a donation for his presidential library in exchange for setting up a meeting with top White House officials. (It was a sting operation set up by a newspaper; no money changed hands.)",
      "Congress has tried, and largely failed for almost two decades, to pass legislation that would require organizations raising funds for presidential libraries to disclose donations. Since 2007, the House has passed five bills regarding presidential library funding transparency \u2014 the most recent being in 2019 \u2014 but they have all been stalled in the Senate.",

      "President Trump and many leaders of the country's largest   technology and energy companies announced more than $90 billion in new investments\u00a0from private companies for Pennsylvania on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 30 minutes during a roundtable discussion at the\u00a0Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit\u00a0at\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University, said 20 \"leading technology and energy companies\" will invest in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy, capitalizing on Pennsylvania's technology and energy assets.",
      "\"We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy. He said the investments will bring \"tens of thousands of jobs\" to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"Our vision for this event came from the realization about the crucial link between artificial intelligence and energy, but never before have the leaders of all those companies, as well as major investors, come together,\" McCormick said on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted Westinghouse, saying the Pennsylvania-based company is set to build 10 nuclear reactors across the country. He also touted his involvement in consummating a\u00a0$14 billion partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, which he said will revitalize the Mon Valley.",
      "Mr. Trump said the investments announced on Tuesday will spawn the development of AI in the region.",
      "\"We're building a future where American workers will forge the steel, produce the energy, build the factories and really run a country like, I believe, this country has never been run before. I think we have a true golden age for America,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We've been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world. I'm honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I'm honored to be in Pittsburgh, and you're going to see some real action here.\"",
      "The organizers hope the investments mark only the beginning, hopeful of leveraging  the summit to ramp up energy production, build more data centers, and spawn new AI companies in the Pittbsurgh area \u2014 making the region the center of AI in the country.",
      "\"We have phenomenal technology resources inside of our universities systems,\" PNC Financial Services Group CEO Bill Demchak said on Tuesday. \"We have an abundance of energy, we have Westinghouse in the area. We have labor availability, and we have a huge need as we see the transformation that AI is causing.\"",
      "The event came after Amazon's announcement in June of a $20 billion investment in data centers across Pennsylvania, the largest economic development project in the state's history.",

      "Several of the president's Cabinet members joined him at the summit.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks were among Trump administration officials listed as summit participants.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was also in attendance. He is participating in a panel about major investments in Pennsylvania, moderated by Penn State University President Dr. Neeli Bendapudi.",
      "Industry leaders like Alphabet President and CEO Ruth Porat, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Blackstone President and CEO Jon Gray, Gecko Robotics founder and CEO Jake Loosararian, EQT President and CEO Toby Rice, and Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman were all listed as panel participants, as well.",
      "Police use pepper spray during Trump protest in Pittsburgh",
      "Mr. Trump's visit was not without pushback, as evidenced on CMU's campus, where signs painted with the words \"protest the summit\" were seen on The Fence.",
      "That sentiment on the CMU Fence was also posted on social media to, in the words of activists, \"call on students and the Pittsburgh community to stand against fossil fuels, AI for surveillance, and authoritarianism.\"",
      "The advocates, who lined the streets across parts of the city, said the summit prioritizes corporate interests over sustainability and ethics.",
      "\"I do believe we should be focusing more on renewable energy, green energy. Just kowtowing to oil and gas is not the way to the future,\" Zach Zourelias of Plum said. \"I'm not saying get rid of it entirely. It is important for Pennsylvania, it is important for the country. But we need to be looking to the future, not the past.\"",
      "Pittsburgh Public Safety said officers used pepper spray on demonstrators outside the event on Tuesday evening.",
      "A spokesperson said police gave dispersal orders to demonstrators blocking the street and confronting attendees leaving the event. The spokesperson said a \"number of demonstrators were actively resisting\" and pushing and shoving officers. That's when two officers deployed pepper spray, officials said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump intends to sign an executive order in the coming days establishing national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image and Likeness program, which has reaped millions of dollars in revenue for top college athletes, according to multiple people familiar with his plans.",
      "College athletes can now make millions before ever going pro thanks to a set of NCAA rules enacted in 2021 that relaxed previous restrictions on being compensated for playing or accepting endorsement deals. Student athletes can now profit from merely showing up to play, or from jersey sales, autographs or serving as spokespeople for companies ranging from global brands to car dealerships near campus.",
      "Mr. Trump is engaging on an issue that has quickly reshaped and, in many ways, roiled college athletics after a House subcommittee on Tuesday advanced a bill along party lines that would establish national standards for sponsorships. The legislation, called the \"SCORE Act,\" would supersede a patchwork of state laws regulating Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL.",
      "While the bill has bipartisan support, there is also bipartisan concern it would give too much power to the NCAA and do little to protect the interests of college athletes.",
      "The NCAA's decision in 2021 to let athletes earn money from NIL deals followed years of political and legal pressure on the collegiate sports giant. For decades, the NCAA imposed steep limits on compensation for student athletes, which it argued were necessary to insulate college athletics from commercial pressures. But opponents \u2014 including many college athletes \u2014 had long argued the rules unfairly cut them out of the millions in revenue that sports like football and basketball can bring in for universities.",
      "Last month, in a massive shakeup, a federal judge signed off on a legal settlement in which the NCAA agreed to let schools pay student athletes directly.",
      "Trump has regularly engaged with professional and college sports of all sorts since and even before retaking office. Whether attending the storied Army-Navy football game last December or stealing the spotlight at last Sunday's Club World Cup championship, the future of sports is a frequent presidential concern.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate narrowly advanced a request from the White House to claw back billions in funds for international aid and public broadcasting, as Congress faces a Friday deadline to act.",
      "The request, known as a rescissions package, cleared its first procedural hurdles late Tuesday, with the help of Vice President JD Vance. The vice president cast two tie-breaking votes after three Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing it.",
      "In June, the White House requested that Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding that had previously been approved for spending, starting the clock on a process that gives lawmakers 45 days to act. If both chambers don't approve an identical package before the deadline, the funding will be spent as planned.",
      "The legislation seeks to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts, with the primary focus being slashing foreign aid. But it would also effectively cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, appeared uncertain if he had the votes to advance it, but moved ahead with a pair of procedural votes later in the day.",
      "Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against moving forward.",
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought met with Senate Republicans as some members remained resistant to pulling back all of the funding. Vought left the luncheon saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate the cuts to a global AIDS prevention program called PEPFAR.",
      "\"There is a substitute amendment that does not include the PEPFAR rescission and we're fine with that,\" Vought told reporters, referring to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.",
      "Vought said the package would total $9 billion with the change and is \"substantially the same package.\"",
      "\"We hope that if we can get this across the finish line in the Senate, that the House would accept that one small modification,\" Thune said.",
      "Last month, the House approved the White House's original request, overcoming opposition from all Democrats and four Republicans.",
      "But the change wasn't enough for the holdouts, who said they hadn't been provided specifics about how certain programs will be affected.",
      "\"We've got big, broad categories, but I haven't been given the comfort, if you will, that we're not impacting maternal and child health, that we're not impacting HIV/AIDS, that we're not impacting nutrition programs and programs related to tuberculosis, malaria, polio, neglected tropical disease, pandemic prevention, family planning,\" Murkowski said, adding that she also a strong supporter of public broadcasting.",
      "\"But more important than all of that, more important is our role here. I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,\" she said. \"We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told this is the priority we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round. I don't accept that.\"",
      "The rescissions package",
      "The rescissions request would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, along with other international assistance programs \u2014 from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects. Also included in the package is a proposed $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "But some Senate Republicans have opposed components of the package, like cuts to a program aimed at combating HIV and AIDS globally.",
      "Started by former President George W. Bush, PEPFAR has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters last week that she wants to strike the PEPFAR rescissions, saying, \"I can't imagine why we would want to terminate that program.\"",
      "Collins, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, pushed back when Vought testified to the panel in June that \"no lifesaving treatment will be impacted by this rescissions package\" and that \"anyone currently receiving lifesaving treatment will continue to receive that treatment.\"",
      "\"When you look at PEPFAR, you are eliminating a lot of the prevention programs,\" Collins said, also questioning whether the package would harm efforts to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, polio and malaria and what effects it would have on maternal and child health programs that help feed malnourished children. \"Those are all programs that have been proven effective.\"",
      "\"These are not only the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons, but they're incredible instruments of soft power,\" Collins said.",
      "Collins on Tuesday said the PEPFAR changes announced by Vought were \"progress,\" but called for more specifics on other cuts.",
      "Others have raised concerns about cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they take on added significance as a means of communicating emergency messages.",
      "One of the Republican members who had concerns, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said Tuesday he would back the bill after working with the Trump administration to find alternate funding.",
      "\"We wanted to make sure tribal broadcast services in South Dakota continued to operate which provide potentially lifesaving emergency alerts,\"\u00a0Rounds posted on X. \"We worked with the Trump administration to find Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.\"",
      "Amending the package will mean the House will have to sign off on the changes. And with the Friday deadline, time is running out to do so before the request expires. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Monday he hoped the Senate sticks with the House-approved package.",
      "\"I think you've got to respect the White House's request, and that's what we did,\" Johnson said.",
      "In the Senate, rescissions bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation, requiring only a simple majority. But with just 53 Republicans, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose a handful of their members to approve the package.",
      "President Trump weighed in on the rescissions push late last week, saying in a post on Truth Social that it's \"very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill,\" citing the public broadcasting cuts in particular. The president warned that any Republican who doesn't support the clawback in funding \"will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the rescissions push has sparked frustration among Democrats, who have little ability to stand in its way. But an upcoming spending fight is another story. Democrats have begun suggesting that the GOP effort to claw back already approved congressional funds could have an impact on their willingness to work across the aisle on government funding down the road.",
      "Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The rescissions process allows Congress to cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned about the upcoming rescissions push in a letter to his colleagues upon the return from the Fourth of July recess, arguing that the package's passage \"would be an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process.\" The New York Democrat called it \"absurd\" for the GOP to expect Democrats to engage in a bipartisan appropriations process that could be undermined by rescissions.",
      "\"Republicans are, in effect, proposing Congress negotiate bipartisan deals in the Committee room, while they retreat to a backroom to rubberstamp President Trump's purely partisan scheme that only needs a simple majority to pass to tear up those very same agreements,\" Schumer wrote.",
      "In response, Thune said on the Senate floor last week that he was \"disappointed\" to see Schumer \"implicitly threaten to shut down the government,\" while adding that he's \"hopeful that that is not the position\" of Senate Democrats.",
      "When asked by reporters about the possibility of a shutdown, Schumer said, \"Ask the Republicans why they are heading on this path.\"",

Gavin Newsom's objections \u2014 to respond to protests in the nation's second-largest city.",
      "\"Thanks to our troops who stepped up to answer the call, the lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.",
      "Around 2,000 Guard troops will be released, Parnell said, or half of the roughly 4,000 who were brought under federal control. About 700 active-duty Marines were also sent to the Los Angeles area last month, part of an effort to protect immigration agents and federal property.",
      "Separately, around 150 Guard members were returned to the state of California earlier this month to help fight wildfires.",
      "In response to Tuesday's decision, Newsom called on the Trump administration to also return the remaining Guard forces.",
      "\"For more than a month, the National Guard has been pulled away from their families, communities and civilian work to serve as political pawns for the President in Los Angeles. While nearly 2,000 of them are starting to demobilize, the remaining guardsmembers continue without a mission, without direction and without any hopes of returning to help their communities,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration argued the deployment was needed to deal with chaotic protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests. But Newsom and other local politicians called the deployment unnecessary and warned it could escalate tensions.",
      "The federal government also accused local law enforcement of not doing enough to protect ICE, which local officials denied.",
      "Mr. Trump took the forces under federal control in early June, following protests against ICE action in Los Angeles. The president said the 60-day mission was intended to quell \"violence and disorder\" and help protect ICE agents and federal property. He invoked a law known as Title 10, which says the president can call Guard troops into federal service to deal with a \"rebellion\" or if \"the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration, calling the deployment an \"unprecedented power grab\" and arguing it was illegal for Mr. Trump to federalize the Guard without his permission. A federal judge initially sided with Newsom, but an appellate court ultimately allowed Mr. Trump to keep the troops in Los Angeles while the legal battle played out, saying the president likely acted within his authority.",
      "During a visit to Los Angeles late last month, Vice President JD Vance called the Guard forces and Marines \"very much a necessary part of what's going on here,\" though he noted the situation in the city had \"gotten a lot better.\"",

I would not want to get ahead of ourselves, so let's wait for Putin's decision on whether he will comment on it himself.\"",
      "Russia's former President Dmitry Medvedev, who is close to the Kremlin, called Mr. Trump's remarks \"a theatrical ultimatum\" in a post on social media, adding that \"Russia didn't care.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said \"at the end of 50 days, if we don't have a deal, too bad.\" Mr. Trump said at that point, \"the tariffs are going to go, and other sanctions\" but he added that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"shouldn't target\" Moscow.",
      "Speaking Monday in the Oval Office alongside visiting NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Mr. Trump said: \"We are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.\" He also announced a deal for the U.S. to sell additional weapons to its NATO allies, with the understanding that they will then send the weapons to Ukraine.",
      "\"We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"This is really big,\" Rutte said. \"And the decision is that you want Ukraine [to have] what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical.\"",
      "Mr. Trump again expressed his frustration with Putin, whom he recently called \"absolutely crazy\" for ordering strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine. On Monday, Mr. Trump suggested the Russian autocrat had a habit of saying one thing and then doing another.",
      "\"I always hang up, say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call.' And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city and I say, 'That's strange.'\" Mr. Trump said. \"After that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "When asked in an interview with CBS News partner BBC News  if he was done trying to deal with the Russian leader, Mr. Trump said: \"I'm disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him. But I'm disappointed in him.\"",
      "In a social media post on Monday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Mr. Trump and thanked his American counterpart, \"for the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\"",
      "\"It's important that we have such a good relationship, and that the Alliance countries are working to increase defense spending,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he and Mr. Trump had made plans to speak again.",
      "\"We agreed to catch up more often by phone and coordinate our steps in the future as well,\" he said. \"Thank you, Mr. President! Thank you, America!\"",
      "Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. The attack, involving tens of thousands of uniformed soldiers and barrages of missiles, came after Russia unilaterally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula after backing separatist forces in the region.",
      "While Russia has maintained control over Crimea and installed its own administration there \u2014 along with a huge swathe of eastern Ukraine seized over the last three years \u2014   its dominion over those regions is not recognized by the U.S., the United Nations, or the majority of the international community.",
      "One of Putin's key demands for a ceasefire in the ongoing war is that Ukraine, and its international backers, should recognize Russian ownership of at least some of that occupied territory.",

But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoride as one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.",
      "And according to\u00a0the American Dental Association, \"70 years of research, thousands of studies and the experience of more than 210 million Americans tell us that water fluoridation is effective in preventing cavities and is safe for children and adults.\"",
      "\"If that's the case, they need to individually go out to each water district and sell it to the people there, and let them make their own water decisions,\" King said.",

      "In the latest skirmish over science, fluoride opponents argue that at high levels, it can lead to kidney and liver damage and lower IQs in children.",
      "The National Institutes of Health's toxicology program in 2024\u00a0determined\u00a0\"with moderate confidence\" that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. That conclusion was based on studies involving fluoride levels of about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has\u00a0questioned\u00a0the validity of the NIH's report, noting it had \"important limitations,\" including the high fluoride levels, and that other reviews have come to different conclusions about fluoride's risks and benefits.",
      "The EPA in 2011\u00a0lowered\u00a0the recommended limit for fluoride in water to cut down on fluorosis \u2014 when spots appear on kids' teeth \u2014 and in the wake of a 2006\u00a0report\u00a0from the National Academy of Sciences that found a lifetime of overconsumption of fluoride can lead to weakened, brittle bones and teeth.",
      "At Arkansas' Fort Smith water system, Lance McAvoy, who oversees the system, told CBS News it's monitored 24/7.",
      "\"We actually take samples every 15 minutes to verify the online equipment,\" McAvoy said, adding there had never been an instance of significantly higher fluoride levels to date.",
      "Dentists such as Kenton Ross, who also serves as president of Arkansas' dental association, say the science supporting fluoride is indisputable.",
      "\"You're gonna see a 25% reduction in tooth decay,\" Ross said of adding fluoride to drinking water. \"We have over 75 years of research over community fluoridation.\"",

The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to hold a vote on Bove's nomination for a seat on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday.",

      "In the memo, the former prosecutors accuse Bove of executing mass firings inside the agency of people \"perceived not to show sufficient loyalty to the Administration's policies.\" They also point to a whistleblower complaint accusing Bove and others of discussing whether to ignore court orders.",
      "The group also argues Bove sought to execute a quid pro quo earlier this year, by forcing out Justice Department employees who refused to work to dismiss New York Mayor Eric Adams' \"serious criminal corruption indictment in return for the mayor's commitment to cooperate with the Administration's immigration policy.\" Bove has denied that Adams' prosecution was dropped as part of a quid pro quo.",

Among those officials was Bove.",
      "\"To ensure that the committee is not accused of 'rubber stamping' this nomination, it has to hear from the whistleblower and review the contemporary and damning documentation he's provided,\" Toomey said.",
      "The Justice Department defended Bove in response to Reuveni's allegations. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said his account contains \"falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,\" and \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "Former federal prosecutors focus on Tillis",
      "Documents reviewed by CBS News showed the group has attempted to press Tillis to \"come to the rescue of the rule of law and oppose the nomination of Emil Bove to the Third Circuit.\"",
      "Tillis told CBS News on Tuesday that Bove \"has the votes\" to move through the Senate Judiciary Committee, after which the Senate would vote on his nomination. But Tillis said he is unsure if Bove has sufficient votes to pass in the Senate. Tillis did not mention any objections he had to Bove's nomination. Tillis has told reporters in the past he's likely to vote in favor of Bove.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2013 A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday reintroduced a comprehensive bill to reform the immigration system and create a potential pathway to legal status for long-term undocumented immigrants.",
      "Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar, Republican of Florida, and Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, announced the legislation, known as the DIGNITY Act, at a press conference alongside more than a dozen co-sponsors.",
      "\"We have 10 million people or more working in construction, hospitality, agriculture, dairy, fisheries, slaughterhouses who are undocumented but are not criminals,\" Salazar told reporters. \"No more need to choose between amnesty or deportation. The Dignity bill is the answer!\"",
      "The measure would establish a \"Dignity Program\" to grant legal status, including work and travel authority, to undocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States for at least five years. Eligible applicants would have to pass a criminal background check, pay taxes and submit $7,000 in restitution over the duration of the seven-year program. After completion, they could renew their status indefinitely to stay and work in the U.S. as long as they meet the criteria. Participants would not be eligible for federal benefits or entitlements.",
      "\"Congress has not passed comprehensive immigration reform in our country in nearly four decades,\" Escobar said. \"This bill addresses long standing, long overdue legislation that will benefit our Dreamers, some of the most important young people in our country who by no choice of their own are here and know no other land than America. This will help American families who are married to an undocumented spouse who have long sought relief through the courts, through law. This will help millions and millions of people who are a critical component of the American economy.\"",
      "The bill makes additional investments to border security and enforcement but would protect sensitive locations from enforcement activities without prior approval, such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. It would also cut visa backlogs and reform the asylum program by expediting processing of asylum seekers with determinations made within 60 days. The bill also includes a $70 billion fund for training American workers.",
      "The legislation comes as the Trump administration faces increasing scrutiny over its mass deportation program. Last week a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily halt indiscriminate immigration raids in Los Angeles and other California counties. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said \"federal agents will continue to enforce the law and abide by the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "A group of farm workers in California is calling for a three-day national strike beginning Wednesday to protest the ICE raids. They're also demanding immediate citizenship for farm workers and encouraging a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Organizers hope the effort to boycott produce products and companies that employ undocumented immigrants will put more pressure on the Trump administration.",
      "\"The immigrant communities across America are terrified,\" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\u00a0 \"They are really scared out there. Some of the kids are skipping school. Families are being separated. We are fighting together trying to bring consensus, trying to bring dignity and security for families across America.\"",

    "story": [
      "An appeals court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking deportation protections and work permits for thousands of people from Afghanistan.",
      "The administration had planned to end temporary protected status for Afghanistan on Monday, part of a broader push to cut back a program that gives migrants reprieve from deportation if their home country is deemed unsafe. The administration argues those protections aren't meant to be permanent and Afghanistan's security situation has improved, though opponents say the country remains unsafe and revocation would force people to uproot their lives.",
      "But in a late-night ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit blocked the administration from putting into place its withdrawal of temporary protected status for one week. The court's administrative stay didn't weigh in on the merits of the case, instead giving the administration and CASA \u2014 a group that sued the government over its policy \u2014 time to file briefs.",
      "\"We are pleased with the Fourth Circuit's decision to temporarily pause the termination of TPS for Afghanistan,\" CASA legal director Ama Frimpong said in a statement, adding the group will push for a longer-term pause. \"Although temporary, every moment counts when it comes to families figuring out their futures and being protected from ICE's terror.\"",
      "AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that has helped relocate Afghans, told CBS News the ruling \"offers a brief but critical window of relief.\"",
      "\"TPS has been a vital lifeline for tens of thousands of Afghans who supported U.S. missions or fled Taliban persecution. Ending it would not only uproot families and destabilize communities, it would betray a promise we made,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in an email. \"We are heartened by the court's stay, but this isn't a victory\u2014it's a pause. And it underscores the need for permanent protections, not political whiplash every few months.\"",
      "The White House criticized the ruling.",
      "\"Once again, a rogue judge is trying to infringe on the separation of powers and impede the Trump administration's rightful ability to carry out its immigration policy. Temporary Protective Status is meant to be 'temporary' in nature. We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the ruling \"ignores the President's clear authorities under both Article II of the Constitution and the plain language of federal law.\"",
      "\"Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet it has been abused as one for decades,\" McLaughlin said. \"The Trump administration is restoring integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.\"",
      "Some 11,700 Afghans are enrolled in temporary protected status, or TPS, according to federal estimates. The program was extended for Afghanistan in 2023, under the Biden administration, which cited a \"deepening humanitarian crisis\" and \"economic collapse\" in Afghanistan since the U.S. military's 2021 withdrawal led the Taliban to retake the country.",
      "The program is separate from the more permanent \"special immigrant visas\" issued to Afghans who worked for the U.S. military, often as translators. And migrants enrolled in TPS can apply for other forms of relief, including asylum.",
      "TPS for Afghanistan was set to expire in May of this year unless the Trump administration chose to extend it again. Two months ago, DHS announced it would end the program in mid-July, saying the administration was \"returning TPS to its original temporary intent.\"",
      "\"Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent[s] them from returning to their home country,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
      "CASA sued Noem over the decision. The group argued the government had not followed the right procedure to end TPS, and alleged the decision wasn't motivated by whether Afghans still qualified for protection, but instead was \"part of the Trump Administration's broader effort to reduce the number of nonwhite immigrants in this country.\"",
      "The government pushed back on the lawsuit, writing that Noem has \"broad discretion\" over which countries qualify for TPS, and arguing the court shouldn't intervene because the protections are only meant to be temporary.",
      "Last week, a federal judge denied DHS's request to dismiss the lawsuit, but also denied CASA's motion to halt the administration's policy. CASA appealed that ruling, and on Monday, an appellate court put the revocation of TPS on hold while it considers the case.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to wind down TPS for scores of other countries, impacting hundreds of thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti, Cameroon and Afghanistan. The program had been expanded by former President Joe Biden, but President Trump has shifted to a more hardline stance on immigration.",
      "The TPS rollback has drawn some lawsuits, but in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS for Venezuelan migrants while the legal battles continue.",

      "According to the source, the memo says all noncitizens who were not formally admitted into the U.S., and entered between or at ports of entry, face detention under Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which says those subject to it \"shall be detained.\"",
      "The Washington Post first reported the new detention rules.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, ICE confirmed the new guidance, saying all \"aliens seeking to enter our country in an unlawful manner or for illicit purposes shall be treated equally under the law, while still receiving due process.\"",
      "\"The recent guidance closes a loophole to our nation's security based on an inaccurate interpretation of the statute,\" ICE said. \"It is aligned with the nation's long-standing immigration law.\"",
      "DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said President Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem \"are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe.\"",
      "\"Politicians and activists can cry wolf all they want, but it won't deter this administration from keeping these criminals and lawbreakers off American streets \u2014 and now thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, we will have plenty of bed space to do so,\" she added.",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by Mr. Trump earlier this month, allocated an unprecedented amount of money towards immigration enforcement and border security, with $75 billion given to ICE alone.",
      "Administration officials have said they plan to use the massive funding infusion to hire 10,000 deportation officers and give ICE the ability to hold more than 100,000 detainees at any given time. On Tuesday morning, ICE was holding more than 58,000 detainees facing deportation, according to internal agency data shared with CBS News.",
      "Greg Chen, the head of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said ICE officials in more than a dozen immigration courts have been telling judges in recent days that the new policy change requires the detention of those who entered the country illegally, irrespective of how recently.",
      "\"This automatic detention rule means hundreds of thousands of people will be deprived of their liberty, even if there's no need for them to be detained,\" Chen said.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 07:25:56 -0400",
    "summary": "As President Trump ramps up the pressure on dozens of countries, trade experts fear U.S. tariff policy leaves consumers and businesses in limbo.",
    "story": [
      "A flurry of tariff threats by President Trump leaves U.S. consumers and businesses in limbo ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline to deploy the import duties against more than 50 countries around the world, according to economists and trade experts.",
      "\"Nobody knows whether these are threats or whether they will become policy, so it seems like everyone has become desensitized to them,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that uncertainty over U.S. tariffs leaves companies in \"a very dense fog.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday announced he is imposing 30% tariffs against Mexico and the 27-member European Union. That followed moves to threaten tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on roughly two dozen countries, including key U.S. trading partners such as Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea.",
      "The White House last week also said it plans to impose a 50% levy on copper imports by Aug. 1, raising concerns about higher costs for electronics, cars and numerous other products that use the metal.",
      "Heat on Russia and Brazil",
      "In a separate development that illustrates the White House's willingness to use tariffs to accomplish its aims beyond trade, Mr. Trump is threatening sharply higher tariffs as he tries to tamp down conflict in Ukraine. The president said on Monday that the U.S. will impose 100% tariffs on countries that engage in trade with Russia if there is no peace deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days.",
      "In another case of hitching trade policy to other foreign policy priorities, Mr. Trump said last week that the U.S. would slap a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",
      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",
      "So far, the White House has notched only a handful of trade deals, experts note, while agreements with major trading partners like the EU have been harder to come buy. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump announced a pact between the U.S. and Vietnam, while in June a more limited deal was reached with the United Kingdom that the White House said provides gives \"American companies unprecedented access to British markets while bolstering U.S. national security.\"",
      "Also last month, the U.S. and China announced that they\u00a0had agreed on a framework for a trade deal that makes it easier for U.S. businesses to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals.",
      "But with little time to thrash out trade agreements ahead of the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, some trade experts say the U.S. has made little progress since suspending country-based tariffs in April.",
      "\"We don't have any comprehensive deals with our largest trading partners,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank. \"Where this leaves us is where we've been \u2014 in a period of high uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\"",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said mixed messages from the Trump administration on trade is making it difficult to nail down agreements.",
      "\"How do you negotiate with someone when you don't know what they want?\" he said. \"One day, [President Trump] says they are about trade deficits, the next day it's about raising revenue, the next it's about stimulating American industry \u2014 then it's a bargaining tool. His multiple goals conflict with one another.\"",
      "Demanding equal footing",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Mr. Trump's tariff agenda is driven in part by his desire for U.S. trade partners to lower both \"tariff and non-monetary trade barriers that are undermining American industries.\"",
      "Such moves by other nations would allow American industries to \"be on a more equal footing to compete and grow,\" Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's trade policies, tariffs have yet to significantly affect consumer prices in the U.S.",
      "Oxford's Daco said that the average U.S. tariff rate in June was around 15%, while the effective tariff rate -- or actual cost of tariffs on imports \u2014 was 10%. That's part of the reason, combined with a front-loading of imports by companies, why prices have been slow to rise.",
      "\"In terms of the full bite of tariffs, it's not yet visible in the duties collected,\" he said.",
      "Following are the tariff rates the U.S. said last week it would impose on roughly two dozen countries as well as members of the EU:",

      "The Pentagon has signed on to use Grok, the AI chatbot built by Elon Musk's company xAI, as part of a new $200 million agreement that opens the door for its deployment across the federal government, the company announced Monday.",
      "The announcement comes amid Musk's public breakup with President Trump and days after Grok generated antisemitic responses and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",
      "The move aligns with the Trump administration's push for more aggressive adoption of artificial intelligence across the government. Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has championed AI as a pillar of national security and innovation.",
      "Musk himself briefly served in the Trump administration earlier this year, overseeing the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before stepping down in May amid a public break with Mr. Trump over his sweeping tax and spending bill. Musk has since emerged as a sharp critic of that legislation, even floating the idea of launching a third political party.",
      "Despite the rift, xAI has continued to expand its government work. The new offering includes custom national security tools, AI-powered science and health applications, and cleared engineering support for classified environments.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok generated antisemitic responses to user prompts and referenced Hitler  as part of what the company called an effort to make the model \"less politically correct.\" Hours later, Musk wrote in a post on X that \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",
      "The posts were later deleted and xAI said it \"quickly\" patched the issue. One day later, xAI launched an upgraded version of Grok it described as a major leap forward. Musk also announced that Grok would be used in Teslas.",

      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of\u00a0lab-grown corals and the\u00a0removal of healthy corals, but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before.",
      "\"It's the first time ever in the world that an international cross of corals from different countries have been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  School of Marine Science, told CBS News on a boat ride near Miami.",
      "There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, one of which is the Elkhorn coral.",
      "The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks",
      "\"Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,\" Baker said. \"And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population.\"",
      "So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in \"the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,\" Baker said.",
      "To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S.",
      "Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the \"Flonduran\" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker.",

    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",
      "Michael said, \"I wanted to show him he didn't get the best of me. I'm not your victim anymore. I'm not somebody you prey on anymore.\"",
      "Gribble, now 75, pleaded guilty to one count of rape, and is currently serving 10 years in prison.",
      "With a federal grant to help cover the costs of testing, the G.O.L.D. Unit has now helped solve 13 rape cases in the Cleveland area, with Barbara Rae-Venter's help. Yet, neither O'Malley nor Weston has ever met Rae-Venter. \"We Zoom!\" Weston laughed.",
      "I asked, \"Is that a little odd, that you're working with this investigator who really never leaves her dining room table? That's where she does all her investigations.\"",
      "\"I hope she never leaves it again!\" O'Malley laughed.",
      "The technique that Rae-Venter used to track down Dennis Gribble has been used to identify other elusive criminals, including Bryan Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "O'Malley says he believes genetic genealogy will someday solve less serious offenses as well. \"Right now, it's still a very expensive tool, and it takes a lot of time,\" he said. \"But I do see it expanding in the future.\"",
      "Still, as the field expands, so have privacy concerns. Some states have set limits, although there are no national laws restricting the use of genetic genealogy by law enforcement.",
      "And for victims like Michael, the benefits outweigh the risks. Genetic genealogy was his only chance for justice. \"It was a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"The guy would have got away scot-free. Had it not been for DNA and genealogy, I would have never been here today. We wouldn't even be talking about it.\"",

      "NWA 16788, the largest piece of Mars on Earth, was expected to fetch between $2 million and $4 million during the auction\u00a0in New York City, according to Sotheby's. The final price was $5,296,000, which includes the hammer price, premiums and local taxes, according to the auction house. Sotheby's has not publicly identified the buyer.",
      "Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite was on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries ahead of the auction on Wednesday.",

      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",

      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",

      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "The black hole was discovered in November 2023, during an observation period by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The observation period began in May 2023, and the first part of the period ended in January 2024.",
      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland. Data from the observation window will be published later in the summer.

      "The stars are also emitting bright light, represented in blue in the Webb images. Glowing red spots in the Webb images show areas where star formation is underway, NASA said. Other stars look blue-white. These ones have no radiation between themselves and Webb's camera, NASA said. At the bottom of the \"toe bean\" are small, dense filaments of dust that may be dense enough to collapse in on themselves and begin the process of becoming stars. The dust itself is imaged in brown.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",
      "\"After a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that House Speaker Mike Johnson telephoned into the meeting and \"looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible.\"",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump and many leaders of the country's largest   technology and energy companies announced more than $90 billion in new investments\u00a0from private companies for Pennsylvania on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 30 minutes during a roundtable discussion at the\u00a0Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit\u00a0at\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University, said 20 \"leading technology and energy companies\" will invest in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy, capitalizing on Pennsylvania's technology and energy assets.",
      "\"We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy. He said the investments will bring \"tens of thousands of jobs\" to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"Our vision for this event came from the realization about the crucial link between artificial intelligence and energy, but never before have the leaders of all those companies, as well as major investors, come together,\" McCormick said on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted Westinghouse, saying the Pennsylvania-based company is set to build 10 nuclear reactors across the country. He also touted his involvement in consummating a\u00a0$14 billion partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, which he said will revitalize the Mon Valley.",
      "Mr. Trump said the investments announced on Tuesday will spawn the development of AI in the region.",
      "\"We're building a future where American workers will forge the steel, produce the energy, build the factories and really run a country like, I believe, this country has never been run before. I think we have a true golden age for America,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We've been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world. I'm honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I'm honored to be in Pittsburgh, and you're going to see some real action here.\"",
      "The organizers hope the investments mark only the beginning, hopeful of leveraging  the summit to ramp up energy production, build more data centers, and spawn new AI companies in the Pittbsurgh area \u2014 making the region the center of AI in the country.",
      "\"We have phenomenal technology resources inside of our universities systems,\" PNC Financial Services Group CEO Bill Demchak said on Tuesday. \"We have an abundance of energy, we have Westinghouse in the area. We have labor availability, and we have a huge need as we see the transformation that AI is causing.\"",
      "The event came after Amazon's announcement in June of a $20 billion investment in data centers across Pennsylvania, the largest economic development project in the state's history.",
      "Major political and industry leaders in Pittsburgh",
      "Several of the president's Cabinet members joined him at the summit.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks were among Trump administration officials listed as summit participants.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was also in attendance. He is participating in a panel about major investments in Pennsylvania, moderated by Penn State University President Dr. Neeli Bendapudi.",
      "Industry leaders like Alphabet President and CEO Ruth Porat, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Blackstone President and CEO Jon Gray, Gecko Robotics founder and CEO Jake Loosararian, EQT President and CEO Toby Rice, and Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman were all listed as panel participants, as well.",
      "Police use pepper spray during Trump protest in Pittsburgh",
      "Mr. Trump's visit was not without pushback, as evidenced on CMU's campus, where signs painted with the words \"protest the summit\" were seen on The Fence.",
      "That sentiment on the CMU Fence was also posted on social media to, in the words of activists, \"call on students and the Pittsburgh community to stand against fossil fuels, AI for surveillance, and authoritarianism.\"",
      "The advocates, who lined the streets across parts of the city, said the summit prioritizes corporate interests over sustainability and ethics.",
      "\"I do believe we should be focusing more on renewable energy, green energy. Just kowtowing to oil and gas is not the way to the future,\" Zach Zourelias of Plum said. \"I'm not saying get rid of it entirely. It is important for Pennsylvania, it is important for the country. But we need to be looking to the future, not the past.\"",
      "Pittsburgh Public Safety said officers used pepper spray on demonstrators outside the event on Tuesday evening.",
      "A spokesperson said police gave dispersal orders to demonstrators blocking the street and confronting attendees leaving the event. The spokesperson said a \"number of demonstrators were actively resisting\" and pushing and shoving officers. That's when two officers deployed pepper spray, officials said.",
      "\"At no time was there an order or authorization for large scale crowd or riot control agents to be used,\" the spokesperson told KDKA.",

      "Elmo's X account posted antisemitic and racist posts after it was hacked on Sunday, a spokesperson for the makers of \"Sesame Street\" said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Elmo's X account posted a statement\u00a0saying the account \"was briefly hacked by an outside party, in spite of the security measures in place.\"",
      "\"We strongly condemn the abhorrent antisemitic and racist content, and the account has since been secured,\" it said. \"These posts in no way reflect the values of Sesame Workshop or Sesame Street, and no one at the organization was involved.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, which is the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street,\" had said on Monday that Elmo's X account was \"briefly compromised\" on Sunday \"by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",
      "The posts contained slurs against Jews and commentary about President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges. The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death. The findings sparked a furor among some Trump supporters after right-wing media figures spent years promoting the idea of a cover-up or conspiracy.",
      "The posts on Elmo's X account were published several days after the team behind Grok, Elon Musk's xAI chatbot, deleted several posts on Musk's X in which the chatbot made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. The company later issued an apology.",
      "Musk and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, have been criticized for a surge of antisemitic and other hate speech on the site since he took ownership in October 2022. Musk allowed previously banned users back onto the platform \u2014 including\u00a0Andrew Tate,\u00a0Kanye West\u00a0and some notorious neo-Nazi figures \u2014 and reduced content moderation in the name of free speech.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League has also also been tracking a rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. The nonprofit\u00a0organization  said that last year, it recorded 9,354 antisemitic incidents nationwide, which is the highest number since it started monitoring more than four decades ago.

      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",

      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

    "story": [
      "Indeed and Glassdoor, the job search and employee review firms, are slashing a total of roughly 1,300 jobs as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, embraces artificial intelligence.",
      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs come as corporate leaders tout AI's capabilities, while some experts warn that the technology could lead to job losses. Speaking in June at the the Aspen Ideas Festival, for example, Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI is likely to replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:24:22 -0400",
    "summary": "People are turning to AI dating assistants for help in crafting wittier, more conversational messages to attract romantic partners on apps.",
    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",

      "Musk introduced the new model in a livestream on X late Wednesday, calling Grok 4 \"the smartest AI in the world.\"",
      "\"It really is remarkable to see the advancement of artificial intelligence and how quickly it is evolving,\" Musk said, adding that \"AI is advancing vastly faster than any human.\"",

      "\"We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts. Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved,\" the company said.",
      "Musk attributed Grok 3's remarks to shortcomings in the AI's ability to filter human input, writing on X, \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",

      "Four law enforcement officials, including two current police chiefs, in Louisiana are accused of fabricating police reports in a scheme to illegally obtain U.S. visas for immigrants, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. A Louisiana businessman is also charged in the scheme.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Louisiana alleges\u00a0that between Dec. 26, 2015, and at least July 15, 2025, businessman Chandrakant Patel, Oakdale Police Chief Chad Doyle, Forest Hill Police Chief Glynn Dixon, former Glenmora Police Chief Tebo Onishea and Michael Slaney, a marshal in the Ward 5 Marshal's Office, conspired to produce false reports that were used to apply for U visas, which victims of certain crimes are eligible for.",
      "Immigrants seeking U visas would contact Patel or another facilitator who would contact Patel, according to an indictment. Patel would then allegedly ask Doyle, Dixon, Onishea and Slaney to produce false police reports saying the immigrants had been the victims of armed robberies. The law enforcement officials would also provide certification and attestation of documents needed for the U visa, the indictment said.",
      "U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said in a news conference that the police officials were paid $5,000 for each name they provided a falsified report for. There were hundreds of names listed on the reports, Van Hook said, creating the appearance of an \"unusual concentration of armed robberies of people who were not from Louisiana.\"",
      "\"In fact, the armed robberies never took place,\" Van Hook said.",
      "Patel also allegedly paid the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office $5,000 in February 2025, \"intending to influence and reward\" an agent who would write him a false police report from that office.",
      "Patel is charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, one count of bribery, 24 counts of mail fraud and eight counts of money laundering. Doyle and Dixon are each charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, six counts of visa fraud, six counts of mail fraud and one count of money laundering. Slaney is charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, six counts of visa fraud, six counts of mail fraud and two counts of money laundering. Onishea is charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, six counts of visa fraud and six counts of mail fraud.",

      "The conspiracy charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. The visa fraud charges have a maximum sentence of 10 years per count. The mail fraud charges have a sentence of up to 20 years in prison per count. The defendants could also be ordered to pay a fine of up to $250,000 per count, and the money laundering charges call for the forfeiture of bank accounts, real estate and vehicles. Patel also faces up to 10 years on the bribery charge.",
      "U visas were introduced in October 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. The act was meant to strengthen law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate and prosecute crimes, while protecting victims who are willing to help investigate them. The Associated Press reported that about 10,000 people received U visas in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2022, which was the most recent period that the Department of Homeland Security shared data for.",

      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",

      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",

      "EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco estimates that roughly a third of the June rise in the CPI is attributable to higher tariffs.",

      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

      "NWA 16788, the largest piece of Mars on Earth, was expected to fetch between $2 million and $4 million during the auction\u00a0in New York City, according to Sotheby's. The final price was $5,296,000, which includes the hammer price, premiums and local taxes, according to the auction house. Sotheby's has not publicly identified the buyer.",
      "Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",

      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite was on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries ahead of the auction on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the ongoing controversy over his administration's handling of information related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is a \"Hoax\" and \"bulls***.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the ongoing controversy over his administration's handling of information related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is a \"Hoax\" and \"bulls***,\" criticizing members of his own party who are calling for more transparency as \"weaklings.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, the president compared the uproar over the Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein files to past controversies, like the investigation into his 2016 campaign's possible ties to Russia and Hunter Biden's laptop.",
      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue. Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country's history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "In a meeting at the White House later in the morning, the president reiterated his statement, telling reporters \"they're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.\"",
      "\"I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy, the best we've ever had, and all of the things we've done, including the Middle East. I mean, you see it. Instead, they want to talk about the Epstein hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrats' work. They're stupid people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's statements highlighted the deep divisions in his party over the handling of the Epstein case, including among some of his strongest supporters.",
      "The current controversy began last week, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review of the evidence against Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019. The department said the review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "The memo was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have long called for more transparency about the Epstein files, which they believe might implicate other powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.",
      "The review also exposed internal divisions within the administration itself. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",
      "Prominent Democrats have pressured their GOP colleagues to push for more transparency from the administration, so far unsuccessfully. Two procedural maneuvers in the House that would have required the administration to reveal more evidence about the Epstein case failed to overcome GOP opposition earlier this week.",
      "But Mr. Trump's supporters in conservative media and his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are continuing to call for the administration to release more of what the government knows about the Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",
      "Other Republicans have called on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on charges related to sex trafficking, to testify before Congress. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said that senators \"ought to call her in the Judiciary Committee, put it under oath and have her testify.\"",
      "The president has tried to tamp down the controversy within his party since last week, saying on Tuesday that the Epstein case is \"pretty boring stuff.\"",
      "\"I don't understand it, why they would be so interested. He's [been] dead for a long time, he was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is,\" he told reporters. \"I really don't, and the credible information has been given.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate kicked off what's expected to be another lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon as Congress works to deliver on President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in spending by Friday.",
      "The Senate narrowly advanced the request late Tuesday. Three Republicans opposed the package and Vice President JD Vance had to cast the two tie-breaking votes to move it forward.",
      "The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it has faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans have opposed slashing foreign aid and public broadcasting funding.",
      "Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The Senate's decision to consider amendments to the package means the House will need to approve the final Senate version.",
      "The rescissions request targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS.",
      "Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of the main concerns of Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the \"small modification.\"",
      "When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters, \"we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did.\"",
      "\"We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,\" Johnson added.",
      "But the change did not satisfy Collins, who voted against advancing the package. Collins was joined by two other Republicans senators: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.",
      "The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented.",
      "\"To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,\" Collins said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight.",
      "\"I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,\" she said. \"We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that.\"",
      "Cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, was another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating \"without interruption.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said he would vote for the package, but expected that Congress would later have to try to fix some of the cuts once they determine the impacts.",
      "\"I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,\" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago \u2014 the so-called big, beautiful bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.\"",

      "The lighter came into the family's possession after one of the airman's relatives spotted it in a Facebook post about a year ago, the sergeant's nephew, Vince Musashe, told the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Defense tasked with finding and identifying service members who were either missing in action or prisoners of war during past conflicts.",
      "In the post, shared in 2019 by a Facebook group called the \"Great Lakes Lighter Club,\" a Swiss man who collected lighters showed an installment in his collection. It was the Zippo lighter with Musashe's last name and 27 hash marks that military historians believe represented the airman's 27 missions during the war. They suggested the lighter may have been recovered from Musashe's remains or from the wreckage of his aircraft, which was attacked in 1944, according to DPAA.",
      "Musashe was last seen on April 19 of that year, when he was among a group of American airmen dispatched to bomb part of Berlin. German fire damaged his aircraft, which changed course and accidentally ended up passing over then-occupied Denmark, where the pilot ordered crew members including Musashe to bail out.",

But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",

      "Named K-9 Georgia, the dog died in the kennel inside of her handler's patrol vehicle as the heat index rose to about 100 or 102 degrees in Trenton, a city in the northwestern corner of Georgia, according to the Dade County Sheriff's Office. The handler had gone into the office building when Georgia was left unattended in the patrol car.",
      "The sheriff's office said it fired the dog's handler, who was not identified, and the incident would be turned over to the Dade County District Attorney's Office to determine if charges would be filed.",
      "\"On July 13th, we tragically lost our newest member of our K-9 team; K-9 Georgia,\" the office wrote Tuesday in a news release, adding that \"a combination\" of factors caused the dog's death.",
      "The sheriff's office investigated the incident and determined the air conditioning system in the handler's patrol car malfunctioned while Georgia was inside, to the extent that fixing it required \"total replacement of the compressor.\" A compressor is the core piece of an air conditioning unit that allows it to emit cool air.",
      "We know it's long, but please read the whole thing.\n\nOn July 13th, we tragically lost our newest member of our K-9 team;...",
      "A heat alarm inside the patrol car also malfunctioned, the office said. The alarm is a safety mechanism designed to monitor the temperature in the car and, when it gets too hot, activate its sirens or send notifications to the cell phone of a K-9 dog's handler, according to the National Police Dog Foundation, which notes on its website that \"heat exhaustion is a major cause of death for active K-9s.\" In June 2023, another police dog in Cobb County, Georgia, near Atlanta, died after being left inside its handler's hot car without a functioning air conditioning system.",
      "The sheriff's office said the broken temperature systems, \"coupled with K-9 Georgia being left unattended for what we considered to be an unacceptable amount of time\" inside her handler's car, contributed to the dog's death. It plans to implement new policies for handlers, which will include prohibiting them from leaving dogs in their cars unsupervised \"for extended periods of time\" during the summer. The Dade County District Attorney's Office is determining whether to prosecute the case.",
      "\"Our hearts are aching at the loss of K-9 Georgia,\" the sheriff's office said. \"Many of you know that she was donated to us by a local family, at no cost to the sheriff's office. She was an amazing bloodhound who was sweet, goofy, and had all the potential to be the 'best of the best'. She will be deeply missed by everyone at our office, and by anyone who had the pleasure to meet her.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:01:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",
      "\"After a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that House Speaker Mike Johnson telephoned into the meeting and \"looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible.\"",

    "summary": "Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said the indictment includes a \"notice of special findings,\" which he says is the first step in seeking the death penalty.",
    "story": [
      "A federal grand jury Tuesday handed down a six-count indictment against\u00a0Vance Boelter, the man accused of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses last month, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.",
      "Boelter, 57, is charged with killing former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who survived.",
      "The grand jury indictment includes:",
      "Stalking of Melissa Hortman with intent to murder",
      "Stalking of John Hoffman with intent to murder",
      "Murder of Melissa Hortman (capital offense)",
      "Murder of Mark Hortman (capital offense)",
      "Shooting of Melissa and Mark Hortman",
      "Shooting of John and Yvette Hoffman and the attempted shooting of Hope Hoffman",
      "If convicted on the stalking or shooting charges, Boelter could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. If convicted on the murder charges, he could face life in prison or the death penalty.",
      "Joseph H. Thompson, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, who led Tuesday's news conference, says the indictment includes a \"notice of special findings,\" which he says is the first step in seeking the death penalty.",
      "\"The ultimate decision on whether to seek the death penalty will not come for several months,\" Thompson said. \"And will ultimately be decided by Attorney General (Pam) Bondi with input from the Capitol Case Unit in the Department of Justice, along with this office and the victims.\"",
      "U.S. attorney shares details on Boelter's letter to FBI Director Kash Patel",
      "While updating on the indictment, Thompson also shared details of a letter that his office says was written by Boelter with the hope that it would be delivered to FBI Director Kash Patel. In the letter, Boelter claimed to have been trained \"off the books\" by the U.S. military, and claimed he had performed missions for them overseas.",
      "According to court documents, the letter had been written after the shootings of the Hortmans and Hoffmans.",
      "Thompson added that Boelter also, in the letter, made claims that Gov. Tim Walz approached him and wanted him to kill Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Boelter allegedly claimed, in the letter, that he wanted to go public with that claim but that \"people\" threatened to kill his family if he didn't do it.",
      "In the letter, he allegedly tried to communicate to Patel, \"If you want me to turn myself in it need (sic) to be directly to you and then I need to be held at a military prison or on in asia (sic) or the middle East, or at least on a military ship over there.\"",
      "Thompson suggested it would be speculation to declare whether the contents of Boelter's note were \"a delusion\" or whether they were an attempt to \"misdirect our investigation or, frankly, to excuse his crimes.\"",
      "\"You should notice how I didn't fire one round at any police officers and boy did I have plenty of opportunity,\" Boelter wrote in the letter, court documents say.",
      "Thompson previously said the federal case will precede Hennepin County's case because of the serious issues involved.",
      "\"Vance Boelter committed a terrible act of political violence and extremism \u2014 a targeted political assassination that was unprecedented in the state of Minnesota,\" Thompson said Tuesday. \"It's been a terrible, personal tragedy for the Hoffman and Hortman families and something that has rocked the entire state of Minnesota and even the country.\"",
      "Boelter also faces state charges, and could face life without parole if convicted on those.",
      "Hope Hoffman released a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying, in part, \"I feel relief today in knowing that the perpetrator of these heinous acts will be charged to the fullest extent of the law. Though I was not shot physically, I will now forever coexist with the PTSD of watching my parents be nearly shot dead in front of me and seeing my life flash before my eyes with a gun in my face.\"",
      "Authorities say Boelter impersonated a police officer and shot the lawmakers and their spouses at their respective Twin Cities homes on June 14. He was arrested at his Sibley County home after a 36-hour manhunt that officials said was the largest in state history.",
      "Earlier this month, Boelter made a court appearance where he waived his right to a probable cause hearing and a detention hearing he had scheduled. He told the judge he was \"looking forward to the truth about the 14th [getting] to the public.\"",
      "In a previous court appearance, Boelter told the court he hadn't slept in about two weeks and complained of poor conditions at the Sherburne County Jail in Elk River, Minnesota. The Sherburne County sheriff disputed those claims.",
      "Police\u00a0recovered more than 50 guns\u00a0from his Green Isle, Minnesota, home and his vehicle.",

      "Sixteen civilians and four cadaver dogs from a Czech search and rescue team landed Sunday in Texas on a U.S. military flight from Ramstein Air Base in Germany.",
      "National Guard Bureau Chief General Steve Nordhaus coordinated the team's arrival and met the team leads in person on Tuesday while he was visiting Kerrville, Texas, for updates on response efforts.",
      "\"Thanks for being here, Texas and the Czech Republic were partners right from the beginning in 1993 and what just an amazing partnership,\" Nordhaus told the team leads at the Kerrville-Kerr County Airport.",
      "The Texas and Nebraska National Guard have since 1993 shared a military relationship with the Czech Republic as part of the National Guard Bureau's State Partnership Program that pairs states with countries to train together.",
      "There are over 100 partnerships with about 115 countries around the world, according to the National Guard, and the one with the Czech Republic was one of the first after the initiative began in 1991.",
      "The Czechs providing support in the wake of floods in Texas follows assistance the Texas National Guard gave last year when the Czech Republic experienced severe flooding.",
      "When a flood hit Ostrava in the Czech Republic in September 2024, a Texas Air National Guard unit training in Europe diverted an MQ-9 Reaper drone to Ostrava to provide aerial assessments for recovery efforts.",
      "In Texas, about 230 members of the Texas National Guard are currently supporting response efforts. According to the Texas National Guard, members of the guard rescued over 500 people in the initial 24 hours after the flooding began. About 360 of those were evacuated using UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.",
      "During a Black Hawk flight over the Guadalupe River Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pointed out to Nordhaus flood-impacted areas, explaining where the water rose at a terrifying speed \u2014 prompting urgent evacuations \u2014 and emphasizing how intensive the search will remain for the roughly 100 people still unaccounted for.",
      "After the flight, both Abbott and Nordhaus spoke to members of the Guard who have assisted in rescue and recovery efforts since the floods began on July 4.",
      "One of the air rescues came on July 4 when two Guard helicopters evacuated 130 children from Camp Mystic, a summer camp severely impacted by floods that led to the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors.",
      "The 130 rescued the day of the flood by the guard were evacuated from Camp Mystic and taken to higher ground, according to Captain Connor Garrison, who led one of the aircraft and recounted the mission to Nordhaus and Abbott.",
      "\"I appreciate you, I couldn't be prouder,\" Abbott told Garrison and other members of the Guard.",
      "The Texas National Guard is receiving support from other states like Arkansas, Arizona and North Dakota, which are providing additional personnel or equipment. For instance, North Dakota has sent down one of its own MQ-9 Reaper drones to help survey debris scattered along the still swollen Guadalupe River.",

    "story": [
      "Damascus, Syria \u2014 The Israeli military launched a rare airstrike in the heart of Damascus on Wednesday, hitting the Syrian Defense Ministry headquarters and drawing a call from the Trump administration for \"the fighting to stop\" as clashes in the southern Syrian city of Sweida continued. Israel's attack came hours after a drone strike on the same building. Syrian state media reported a \"number of casualties\" without giving further details.",
      "As clashes have raged for days in the city of Sweida, the capital of the province of the same name, between government forces and Druze armed groups, Israel has launched a series of strikes targeting government troops and convoys, which it says are in support of the religious minority group, and has vowed to escalate its involvement.",
      "It has also beefed up its forces along its border with Syria.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said after the airstrike in a post on X that the \"painful blows have begun.\"",
      "Trump administration \"very concerned\" over Israeli strikes in Syria",
      "The Israeli strikes have raised concern in Washington, where the Trump administration has tried in recent weeks to help Syria's new government solidify control and build ties with the international community.",
      "The U.S. lifted a wide range of sanctions against Syria in late June, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the moves were intended to encourage investment in the country.",
      "\"Syria must also continue to work towards becoming a stable country that is at peace, and today's actions will hopefully put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future,\" Bessent said at the time.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration was \"very concerned about Israel's strikes in Syria,\" adding: \"We are talking with all relevant parties on all sides. We want the fighting to stop.\"",
      "Rubio called the clashes around Sweida \"a direct threat to efforts to help build a peaceful and stable Syria,\" adding: \"We have been and remain in repeated and constant talks with the governments of Syria and Israel on this matter.\"",
      "A rebel offensive led by Islamist insurgent groups ousted Syria's longtime despotic leader, Bashar Assad, in December, sending him fleeing into exile in Russia and bringing an end to a nearly 14-year civil war. Since then, the country's new rulers have struggled to consolidate control.",
      "The primarily Sunni Muslim government has faced suspicion from Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, whose fears increased after clashes between government forces and pro-Assad armed groups in March spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks. Hundreds of civilians of the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad belongs, were killed.",
      "Syria's Defense Ministry had earlier blamed militias in the Druze-majority area of Sweida for violating a ceasefire agreement that had been reached Tuesday, causing Syrian army soldiers to return fire. It said they were \"adhering to rules of engagement to protect residents, prevent harm, and ensure the safe return of those who left the city back to their homes.\"",
      "But reports of attacks on civilians continued to surface, and Druze with family members in the conflict zone searched desperately for information about their fate amid communication blackouts.",
      "Claims of government forces attacking Druze civilians",
      "In Jaramana near the Syrian capital, Evelyn Azzam, 20, said she fears that her husband, Robert Kiwan, 23, is dead. The newlyweds live in the Damascus suburb, but Kiwan would commute to Sweida for work each morning and got trapped there when the clashes erupted.",
      "Azzam said she was on the phone with Kiwan when security forces questioned him and a colleague about whether they were affiliated with Druze militias. When her husband's colleague raised his voice, she heard a gunshot. Kiwan was then shot while trying to intervene.",
      "\"They shot my husband in the hip from what I could gather,\" she said, struggling to hold back tears. \"The ambulance took him to the hospital. Since then, we have no idea what has happened.\"",
      "A Syrian Druze from Sweida living in the United Arab Emirates said her mother, father, and sister were hiding in a basement in their home near the hospital, where they could hear the sound of shelling and bullets from outside. She spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear her family might be targeted.",
      "She had struggled to get hold of them, but when she reached them, she said, \"I heard them cry. I have never heard them this way before.\"",
      "Another Druze woman living in the UAE with family members in Sweida, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said a cousin told her that a house where their relatives lived had been burned down with everyone inside it.",
      "It reminded her of when ISIS extremists attacked Sweida in 2018, she said. Her uncle was among many civilians there who took up arms to fight back while Assad's forces stood aside. He was killed in the fighting.",
      "\"It's the same right now,\" she told The Associated Press. The Druze fighters, she said, are \"just people who are protecting their province and their families.\"",
      "Who are the Druze, and why would Israel defend them?",
      "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "The latest escalation in Syria began with a series of tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks involving local Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze armed factions in the southern province. Government forces that intervened to restore order then clashed with the Druze.",
      "Videos surfaced on social media of government-affiliated fighters forcibly shaving the mustaches of Druze sheikhs, and stepping on Druze flags and pictures of religious clerics. Other videos showed Druze fighters beating captured government forces and posing by their dead bodies. AP reporters in the area saw burned and looted houses.",
      "No official casualty figures have been released since Monday, when the Syrian Interior Ministry said 30 people had been killed. U.K.-based monitoring organization, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said more than 250 people had been killed as of Wednesday morning, including four children, five women and 138 soldiers and security forces.",
      "The observatory said at least 21 people were killed in \"field executions.\"",
      "Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa issued a statement Wednesday condemning the violations.",
      "\"These criminal and illegal actions cannot be accepted under any circumstances, and completely contradicts the principles that the Syrian state is built on,\" the statement read, vowing that perpetrators, \"whether from individuals or organizations outside of the law, will be held accountable legally, and we will never allow this to happen without punishment.\"",
      "In Israel, the Druze are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the military. In Syria, the Druze have been divided over how to deal with the country's new leaders, with some advocating for integrating into the new system while others remained suspicious and pushed for an autonomous Druze region.",
      "On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Katz said in a statement that the Israeli army \"will continue to attack regime forces until they withdraw from the area \u2014   and will also soon raise the bar of responses against the regime if the message is not understood.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday night that Israel has \"a commitment to preserve the southwestern region of Syria as a demilitarized area on Israel's border\" and has \"an obligation to safeguard the Druze locals.\"",
      "MG Ori Gordin, who is the commander of the Israeli military's Northern Command, said the IDF was \"operating decisively\" in the Sweida area, \"striking regime targets in the region.\"",
      "\"We are increasing the pressure and the pace of the strikes,\" Gordin said. \"We also carried out strikes in Damascus and will continue to strike throughout southern Syria.\"",
      "Israel has taken an aggressive stance toward Syria's new leaders since Assad's fall, saying it doesn't want Islamist militants near its borders, despite the U.S. and other nations recognizing the new government led by al-Sharaa.",

      "The family of Musallet, whose full name was Saifullah Kamel Musallet, told CBS News on Saturday that he was beaten to death on Friday by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.",
      "In a statement, they said he was killed in a confrontation with settlers while trying to protect his family's land in the town of Sinjil, north of Ramallah, and that the settlers had surrounded him for more than three hours, blocking an ambulance and paramedics from reaching him.",
      "The family's statement said his younger brother carried him to an ambulance after the group cleared, but that Musallet died before he was able to reach the hospital.",
      "He had been due to return to his home in Tampa, Florida, this week, his relatives said.",
      "Musallet's killing comes amid an\u00a0increase in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thameen Al-Kheetan, said Tuesday.",
      "\"Israeli settlers and security forces have intensified their\u00a0killings, attacks and harassment of Palestinians\u00a0in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in the past weeks,\" Al-Kheetan said.",
      "He said that \"during the first half of 2025, there have been 757 settler attacks that resulted in Palestinian casualties or property damage \u2013 a 13 per cent increase on the same period in 2024.\"",
      "\"Israel must immediately stop these killings, harassment and home demolitions across the occupied Palestinian territory,\" Al-Kheetan said. \"As the occupying power, Israel must take all feasible measures to ensure public order and safety in the West Bank. It is under the obligation to protect Palestinians from settler attacks and to end the unlawful use of force by its security forces. There must be thorough, independent and transparent investigations into all killings and all other alleged violations of international law. Those responsible must be held to account.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces told CBS News on Wednesday that immediately \"following the incident, a joint investigation was launched by the Israel Police and the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division.\"",

      "Last week, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on President Trump to hold Israel accountable for Musallet's death and \"put America first.\"",
      "\"This murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\" CAIR-Florida Executive Director Imam Abdullah Jaber said in a statement. \"Every other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians. If President Trump will not even put America first when Israel murders American citizens, then this is truly an Israel First administration.\"",

      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

      "Bolsonaro says he is the victim of political persecution, echoing Mr. Trump's defense when he faced criminal charges before his White House return.",
      "\"It's not about imprisoning me; they want to eliminate me,\" Bolsonaro told news website Poder360 on Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors say Bolsonaro tried to overturn his 2022 loss in a plot that only failed because the military did not side with him. The plan allegedly included dozens of people and involved a plot to poison Lula and shoot a Brazilian Supreme Court justice. Bolsonaro's defense team has vehemently denied the charges. Bolsonaro has also been barred from running for office until 2030, after casting doubt on the country's electronic voting machines.",
      "After the plot failed, violent Bolsonaro supporters rioted, rampaging through government buildings in the capital Brasilia in scenes that echoed the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Mr. Trump's supporters after the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "The trial has attracted attention from Mr. Trump, who returned to power in the 2024 election and continues to claim \u2014   despite this being rejected repeatedly by the courts \u2014   that he won in 2020. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on social media for Bolsonaro's trial to be stopped, accusing the authorities in Brazil of mounting a \"witch hunt\" and a \"disgrace.\"",
      "On July 9, he took his campaign to extraordinary new levels by announcing plans to tariff Brazilian imports to the U.S. at 50%, again citing what he called a \"witch hunt\" against Bolsonaro. And on Tuesday, Washington said it was opening an investigation into \"unfair trading practices\" by Brazil, a move that could provide a legal basis to justify imposing tariffs on South America's largest economy.",
      "Unlike the tariffs that Mr. Trump is slapping on countries around much of the world, including top U.S. allies, the measures against Brazil \u2014   which are set to take effect on August 1 \u2014   were announced in openly political terms.",
      "Mr. Trump cited \"Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections,\" among other issues, warning of further escalation if the country retaliated \u2014 something Lula indicated would happen.",
      "Unlike many other countries that have been threatened with tariff hikes, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, meaning Brazil buys more American goods than the U.S. buys from Brazil. Last year, the U.S. exported about $49 billion worth of goods to Brazil, and Brazil exported just over $42 billion in goods to the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump reiterated his claim that Bolsonaro was being unfairly treated.",
      "\"They're treating President Bolsonaro very unfairly,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, calling him \"a good man.\"",
      "\"I know the honest ones, and I know the crooked ones,\" he added.",

At least nine abbots and senior monks involved in the scandal have been disrobed and cast out of the monkhood, the Royal Thai Police Central Investigation Bureau said.",
      "Wilawan Emsawat, in her mid-30s, was arrested at her home in Nonthaburi province north of the capital Bangkok on charges including extortion, money laundering and receiving stolen goods. Police said they traced money transferred to her by a senior monk from a bank account belonging to his temple in northern Thailand.",

    "story": [
      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

    "summary": "The FBI released seeking information posters for three Iranian intelligence officers accused in the 2007 abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert Levinson.",
    "story": [
      "Federal authorities on Tuesday released new images of three Iranian intelligence officers allegedly involved in the abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert Levinson.",
      "Each attached to a seeking information poster, the images of Reza Amiri Moghadam, Taghi Daneshvar and Gholamhossein Mohammadnia are part of an extensive investigation into Levinson's disappearance in 2007, the FBI's Washington field office said.",
      "Moghadam is the current Iranian ambassador to Pakistan and previously led the operations unit of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security in Tehran, an agency whose members the FBI has accused of helping orchestrate Levinson's abduction.",
      "Daneshvar is described by the FBI as a high-ranking officer in the Iranian intelligence ministry involved in counterespionage activities. Around the time Levinson disappeared, he allegedly oversaw the work of\u00a0Mohammad Baseri, another Iranian intelligence officer whom the United States government has accused in the abduction.",
      "Mohammadnia is a senior deputy in the intelligence ministry who served as the Iranian ambassador to Albania in 2016, before being expelled from Albania two years later for \"damaging its national security,\" according to the FBI. The U.S. agency said Mohammadnia led an initiative to blame Levinson's disappearance \"on a terrorist group in Pakistan's Baluchistan region to shift blame away from the Iranian government.\"",
      "\"These three intelligence officers were among those who allegedly facilitated Bob's 2007 abduction and the subsequent cover-up by the Iranian government. Bob likely later perished in captivity far away from his family, friends, and colleagues,\" said Steven Jenson, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington office, in a statement. \"The FBI will continue its relentless pursuit to hold anyone involved in his abduction to account for their reprehensible actions.\"",
      "The U.S. has maintained a view since Levinson vanished that the retired agent was kidnapped during an unauthorized CIA mission in Iran, and subsequently detained wrongfully by the Iranian government. Levinson was believed to be alive for years, until U.S. officials in 2020 said intelligence indicated he may actually have been dead \"for some time.\"",
      "Moghadam, Daneshvar and Mohammadnia were sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in March for allegedly playing a role in Levinson's \"abduction, probable death, and Iran's efforts to cover up or obfuscate their responsibility,\" the federal agency said in an announcement at the time.",
      "The latest seeking information posters followed two others released by the FBI in December, for Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, both Iranian senior intelligence officers thought to be responsible for Levinson's abduction, detention and probable death. Federal authorities have described the men as high-ranking officers in the Iranian intelligence ministry. Both also were sanctioned by the U.S. government.",

    "story": [
      "The Perseids meteor shower begins this week and is expected to offer one of the best shows in the sky of 2025.",
      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But as NASA explains, the meteors don't actually originate from the constellation.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, testified Tuesday at his Senate confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, where he fielded questions about the administration's foreign policy and his plans for the role if he is confirmed.",
      "The hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was the first opportunity for lawmakers to publicly question him about his role in a Signal chat in which top administration officials\u00a0inadvertently disclosed sensitive details about a military strike in Yemen.",
      "In the weeks following the scandal, Democrats said they expected the hearing would be \"brutal\" for Waltz, but the Signal controversy did not come up until more than an hour into the hearing, which focused mostly on the administration's approach to China, Israel and the work of U.N. agencies around the world.",
      "The role of U.N. ambassador \u2014 the last of Mr. Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed \u2014 has been vacant for six months, leaving the U.S. without a top representative on a major world stage as several international crises play out. Waltz is likely to be confirmed, given Republican control of the Senate. Waltz would take the position as Mr. Trump's frustrations increase with Russia over its refusal to end its war in Ukraine and as the U.S. seeks to manage tensions with China and Iran.",
      "The hearing",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah introduced Waltz as \"one of the most well-qualified U.S. ambassador nominees to the United Nations ever,\" calling him a \"seasoned policy mind\" and \"skilled negotiator.\"",
      "\"With Waltz at the helm, the U.N. will have what I regard as what could and should be its last chance to demonstrate its actual value to the United States,\" Lee said.",
      "Republicans used the hearing to criticize the U.N., accusing it of being politicized and working against the U.S. and its allies, despite the U.S. being the largest donor. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump ordered a general review of U.S. funding and involvement in the global body.",
      "\"You've got a heavy lift here,\" said Republican Sen. James Risch of Idaho, the chairman of the committee.",
      "Waltz agreed that the U.N. needs \"major\" reform, but said there's \"good and meaningful work to be done.\"",
      "\"We should have one place in the world where everyone can talk, where China, Russia, Europe, the developing world, can come together and resolve conflicts,\" he said. \"But after 80 years, it's drifted from its core mission of peacemaking.\"",
      "But Democrats argued that a pullback would be at odds with U.S. interests because it would give China more influence.",
      "\"China is all too eager to take advantage of our disengagement at the U.N. and around the world. And while we may not all like what some U.N. institutions do, if we aren't at the table, we can't influence the agenda,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "Waltz responded that it was \"absolutely critical\" for the U.S. to be at the table to counter China's growing influence.",
      "Republicans also accused the U.N. of being a \"hotbed of antisemitism\" and asked Waltz if he would commit to vetoing \"one-sided anti-Israel resolutions.\"",
      "\"Yes, I'll make that commitment,\" Waltz said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware was the first to question Waltz about the Signal scandal, scolding him and the Trump administration for its handling of sensitive details about a military strike. But Waltz maintained that there was no classified information shared in the chat and defended the use of the app as \"not only authorized, it's still authorized and highly recommended.\"",
      "Waltz told Coons that no disciplinary action had been taken by the White House, while the Department of Defense is still conducting its investigation.",
      "\"There's been no consequences, and yet the president continues to denounce those who leak information,\" Coons said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called on Waltz to take accountability for the disclosure, telling him that he showed \"profound cowardice\" in how he handled the incident.",
      "\"I cannot support your nomination,\" Booker said. \"That's not leadership when you blame people that tell the truth. That's not leadership when you can't say the words, 'I made a mistake. I could have done better. I learned valuable lessons from this experience.' Instead, at a moment where our national security was clearly compromised, you denied, you deflected and then you demeaned and degraded those people who objectively told the truth and criticized your actions.\"",
      "The Signal chat",
      "Waltz was ousted as Mr. Trump's national security adviser in May, weeks after the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed that he had unexpectedly been added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app by a user with Waltz's name. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive details of an upcoming military operation in the chat, which included others like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "Administration officials acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that the operational details shared in the chat were classified. Waltz admitted that he created the chat, but denied knowing how Goldberg's contact information got into his phone.",
      "Sources previously told CBS News that Waltz's nomination for the ambassador role, a high-profile post in New York, was a last-minute decision by the president, and that the Signal controversy was one of the factors that led to his departure from the National Security Council.",
      "On Tuesday, Waltz denied being fired from the national security role and said he was kept on at the White House as an adviser.",
      "Mr. Trump named Waltz as his national security adviser, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, days after the Florida Republican was reelected to a fourth term in Congress. The pick cut into Republicans' narrow majority in the House and Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, pleaded with Mr. Trump not to poach any more members for administration roles.",
      "The slim majority stalled Mr. Trump's first choice for U.N. ambassador, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. When nominating Waltz, Mr. Trump said he had asked Stefanik to remain in Congress, where she could help advance his legislative agenda.",

    "story": [
      "A famed Japanese destroyer sunk by U.S. torpedoes during a pivotal battle in World War II has been discovered on the floor of the Pacific Ocean more than 80 years after it sank, an exploration team has revealed. The warship was found still armed with unused depth charges, according to the explorers.",
      "The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki was located by a remotely operated vehicle more than 2,600 feet below the ocean's surface near the Solomon Islands, the Ocean Exploration Trust announced on Saturday.",
      "\"Lying on the seabed at over 800 meters in the Solomon Islands, this is the first time anyone has laid eyes on Teruzuki since it was sunk in WWII's naval battles off Guadalcanal,\" said the trust, which released images and video of the wreck.",
      "Teruzuki (which translates to \"Shiny Moon\" in Japanese) was under the command of Rear Admiral Raizou Tanaka. The legendary naval leader earned the moniker \"Tenacious Tanaka\" among U.S. forces for leading dangerous attacks and so-called \"Tokyo Express\" supply missions during the middle of the night.",
      "Weeks before descending to its watery grave, the Teruzuki used its state-of-the-art weaponry to great effect. In November 1942, the 400-foot-long Akizuki-class destroyer used its rapid-fire 100mm guns to help sink two U.S. destroyers,\u00a0according to the U.S. Naval Institute. The Teruzuki's torpedoes also severely damaged two other U.S. battleships.",
      "But on Dec. 12, 1942, the Teruzuki was targeted by American PT boats as it tried to protect a convoy of supply ships on Guadalcanal's northern coast, according to historians. The Teruzuki was hit by two U.S. torpedoes, breaking its rudder and disabling the ship. Most of the crew were rescued or swam ashore, but nine men died as the Teruzuki plunged to the bottom of the ocean.",
      "A remotely operated camera launched by the Exploration Vessel (E/V) Nautilus brought the first glimpse of the ship since that day when it spotted the wreck on July 10, the trust said. The massive warship had been severed, with its stern and hull 650 feet apart on the seafloor \u2014 but its munitions were still intact.",
      "An eerie video released by the trust shows the stern armed with multiple depth charges. One scientist can be heard on the video saying that an expert warned the team to be \"extra careful as some Japanese ordnance at this time of the war had a reputation for being really sensitive.\"",
      "The team also noted that the ship was found with its forward artillery turrets pointing skyward.",
      "\"When the exploration team found a 19-meter-long severed segment of Teruzuki's stern littered with depth charges, it disproved a long-held theory that it was depth charge explosions that sealed the ship's fate,\" the trust said in a separate news release.",
      "Ship located in Iron Bottom Sound",
      "Iron Bottom Sound in the Solomon Islands was the site of five pivotal naval battles between August and December 1942.",
      "Located about 600 northeast of Australia, the Solomon Islands became coveted territory for both Japan and the Allied Forces during World War II. The tiny island of Guadalcanal was key because of its airfield and its location, which offered command over shipping lanes in the region.",
      "\"Recognizing this island and airfield's strategic value, both sides would soon commit substantial naval and air resources to control the island, the airfield, and its surrounding waters,\" the Ocean Exploration Trust  said.",
      "Dozens of warships were sunk in Iron Bottom Sound, and the Teruzuki is just the latest to be discovered. Earlier this month, the same researchers found the severed bow of the American warship USS New Orleans during seafloor mapping operations in the area.",
      "In addition to the Teruzuki, at least six Japanese warships were lost off Guadalcanal between August and December 1942, according to the trust, and at least 10 Allies ships were lost during the same period.",
      "One of the American vessels lost in the area was the USS Laffey, a Benson-class destroyer that survived a major battle in October 1942 but was sunk in Guadalcanal on Nov. 12, 1942. One of the ships that sank USS Laffey was in fact the Teruzuki, which had only seen combat for a few months until its demise.",
      "The designs and details of Japanese naval ships were cloaked in secrecy during World War II. There are no historical images of the\u00a0  Teruzuki, making the new discovery especially revealing, the trust said.",
      "\"I feel so lucky to see this ship. The fact that we have not seen Teruzuki in over 80 years underscores the importance of recording maritime heritage now,\" said Hiroshi Ishii, a Nautilus science team member and researcher at Kyoto University. \"As a Japanese person, I appreciate the opportunity to witness part of our history and to be part of an international team shedding light on this campaign, which is important to all of our nations' history.\"",
      "In 2023, the wreckage of a Japanese ship that was torpedoed during World War II off the coast of the Philippines was found. The ship was carrying Allied prisoners of war, most of them Australians, when it sank in 1942. All 1,080 people aboard perished.",

      "A jury at the same court had convicted the former friends on two counts each of criminal damage for their 2023 nighttime felling of the tree, for damaging both the sycamore maple tree and the Roman wall. They had faced a possible maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.",

      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "The black hole was discovered in November 2023, during an observation period by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The observation period began in May 2023, and the first part of the period ended in January 2024.",
      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland. Data from the observation window will be published later in the summer. The data used to detect and study the massive black hole will also be made available for other researchers to use, the collaboration said.",

    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner.

      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "And it's inflamed the debate over whether the party's policy or messaging was to blame for last November's election setbacks, when Democrats lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, and whether the party needs to veer to the left or the center to escape the political wilderness.",

      "\"He certainly is going to fit right into that upper echelon of Democrats who are vying for a lead in that party,\" Whatley said of Mamdani. He claimed that \"they\u2019re just unabashedly in that radical woke part of the party.\"",
      "Pointing to last year's elections, when the Republicans won back the White House and Senate and held onto their razor-thin House majority, Whatley argued that \"every single candidate right now on the Democratic side of the aisle is buying into the same failed agenda that they lost with in 2024.\"",
      "Democrats question the effectiveness of the GOP push.",

      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has been referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution regarding mortgage documents.",
      "The director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in May citing alleged misconduct by Schiff, who owns homes in California and Maryland.",
      "\"Based on media reports, Mr. Adam B. Schiff has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property,\" FHFA Director William Pulte wrote in the letter, which Fox News obtained on Wednesday. \"As regulator of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, we take very seriously allegations of mortgage fraud or other criminal activity. Such misconduct jeopardizes the safety and soundness of FHFA\u2019s regulated entities and the security and stability of the U.S. mortgage market.\"",

      "It is unclear if the Justice Department is pursing action against Schiff at this time, but earlier this week, President Donald Trump did demand his longtime foe be brought to justice for the alleged mortgage fraud scheme.",
      "Fox News Digital reached out to the Justice Department for more information, but they did not immediately respond.",
      "Schiff and his wife purchased a home in Potomac, Maryland, in 2003 for $870,000, according to the letter. They entered into a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage agreement for $610,000 at a rate of 5.625% over a term of 30 years, asserting the property would be their primary and principal residence.",
      "The letter said they reaffirmed that the Maryland home was their primary residence in mortgage refinancing filings in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013, despite Schiff being an elected official representing the state of California at the same time.",
      "Fox News obtained a copy of the 2011 affidavit showing Schiff signed certifying that the Maryland house is his primary residence.",
      "Pulte said Schiff and his wife did not list the Maryland home as their secondary residence until 2020.",
      "Over the same time frame, Schiff took a homeowner\u2019s tax exemption on a condo that he owns in Burbank, California, also claiming that home as his primary residence for a $7,000 reduction off of the 1% property tax, Pulte wrote, citing media reports.",
      "In 2023, the letter notes, a spokesperson for Schiff asserted that \"Adam\u2019s primary residence is Burbank, California, and will remain so when he wins the Senate seat.\"",
      "\"Primary residence mortgages receive more favorable loan terms, including lower interest rates, than secondary residence mortgages,\" the letter said. \"Lenders view secondary residence mortgages as significantly riskier, as a borrower is more likely to continue paying off a primary residence mortgage during any financial hardship. Interest rates on secondary residence mortgages are typically between 0.25-0.50% higher than their primary residence counterparts; however, this gap can widen depending on the lender.\"",

      "Schiff \"appears to have falsified records in order to receive favorable loan terms, and also appears to have been aware of the financial benefits of a primary residence mortgage when compared to a secondary residence mortgage,\" Pulte wrote.",
      "According to the letter, a spokesperson for Schiff in 2023 told CNN that, \"Adam\u2019s California and Maryland addresses have been listed as primary residences for loan purposes because they are both occupied throughout the year and to distinguish them from a vacation property.\"",
      "Last year, the letter notes, a federal jury convicted Marilyn Mosby of making false statements on a mortgage application for a Florida condominium when she was the Baltimore City state\u2019s attorney.",
      "The letter also cited how a St. Louis man pleaded guilty last month to fraudulently obtaining home mortgages \"after the hard work of our agency\u2019s IG and the DOJ.\"",
      "\"There are unfortunately too many examples of individuals who commit fraud or mortgage fraud,\" Pulte wrote. \"As always, we look forward to cooperating with the Department of Justice to support any actions that the Department of Justice finds appropriate. U.S. Federal Housing FHFA appreciates the Department of Justice\u2019s support in ensuring the protection of American homebuyers and taxpayers from mortgage fraud and other financial misconduct.\"",

      "A close-up of a cyborg beetle with mounted electronics. (University of Queensland)",
      "How cyborg beetles could navigate disaster zones better than robots",
      "The team\u2019s innovation involves fitting darkling beetles, or Zophobas morio, their scientific name, with microchip backpacks that deliver small electrical signals to guide their movement. These signals stimulate either the beetle\u2019s antennae or their hardened forewings, prompting them to turn, stop or climb. The researchers even demonstrated real-time control using a standard video game controller.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Robots at this scale still struggle with climbing vertical surfaces and navigating uneven terrain. These beetles, on the other hand, are naturally built for it. Their footpads and sensory systems let them crawl through narrow cracks and over rubble. This makes them well-suited for the unpredictable conditions found in disaster zones.",

Their natural ability to climb, squeeze and maneuver through tight spaces eliminates the need for complex mechanical systems. The programmable backpack simply adds directional control without harming the beetle or shortening its lifespan. The result is a biological tool that can access places humans and machines cannot.

      "What if the answer to cleaner energy was right out on the waves? A new green energy system is set to change how we capture clean power, and it all starts with the ocean. French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Some people point out that wave energy still has its hurdles, like dealing with inconsistent wave patterns and currently lower power output compared to wind or solar farms. Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out. Now, the big question is whether creative ideas like water pendulums can help make wave power a key player in the global shift to clean energy.",

      "Bank of America and other big institutions are seeing major customer engagement with their AI-powered chatbots.",
      "AI chatbots are quickly becoming the primary way people interact with the internet. Instead of browsing through a list of links, you can now get direct answers to your questions. However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links. And once you click that link, you might get directed to fake websites. These sites can then be used to steal personal information or login credentials.",

      "What you need to know about AI phishing attacks",
      "Researchers at Netcraft recently ran a test on the GPT-4.1 family of models, which is also used by Microsoft's Bing AI and AI search engine Perplexity. They asked where to log in to fifty different brands across banking, retail, and tech.",
      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",
      "Wikipedia page showing ChatGPT description on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web. As a result, AI tools are more prone to guessing or fabricating links when asked about them, raising the risk of exposing users to unsafe destinations.",

      "As AI phishing attacks grow more sophisticated, protecting yourself starts with a few smart habits. Here are seven that can make a real difference:",
      "AI chatbots often sound confident even when they are wrong. If a chatbot tells you where to log in, do not click the link right away. Instead, go directly to the website by typing its URL manually or using a trusted bookmark.",
      "AI-generated phishing links often use lookalike domains. Check for subtle misspellings, extra words, or unusual endings like \".site\" or \".info\" instead of \".com\". If it feels even slightly off, do not proceed.",
      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",
      "If you want extra protection, the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back. But it also raises big questions about what we value in a tattoo. Is it the art itself, or the artist behind it?",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Every day, millions of people install tiny browser add-ons they believe will improve productivity or entertainment. With so many options available on the Chrome Web Store, users often rely on trust markers like install counts, user reviews and developer reputation to make their choice. Many glance at shiny verification badges and five-star ratings, assume the vetting process was solid, and click \"Install\" without thinking twice.",
      "But attackers have started to exploit these very signals. Researchers recently uncovered a campaign where 18 browser extensions, all listed on the official Chrome and Edge Web Stores, tracked users\u2019 online activity. These extensions had already racked up more than 2 million installs.",

      "A person using Google on a laptop.\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How hackers are hiding malware in popular Chrome extensions",
      "Koi Security researchers discovered that attackers used long-term, strategic tactics to weaponize browser extensions. First, they released functional and legitimate utilities to gain user trust. Over time, these extensions collected positive reviews and built a solid reputation. Then, after months or even years of quiet operation, the attackers pushed a silent update that injected malicious scripts into the trusted codebase.",
      "Since these updates came directly from official sources, they easily bypassed corporate firewalls. Unlike phishing emails or shady downloads, the malicious code arrived through routine, automatic updates and raised no immediate red flags.",
      "How malicious Chrome extensions evade detection and spread",
      "As the investigation progressed, researchers traced suspicious traffic back to a seemingly harmless color picker extension. This led them to a cluster of connected domains, each acting as a command and control hub. These servers recorded every URL users visited and issued commands to force redirects to fake websites or ad-heavy landing pages.",
      "Next, the team analyzed the extension\u2019s code more closely and uncovered matching fingerprints in several unrelated tools. These included weather widgets, emoji keyboards, video speed controllers and volume boosters. Although they appeared different on the surface, they shared underlying code and behavior.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Together, these extensions reached over two million installations. To avoid detection, the attackers used separate branding and categories for each one, making it difficult for marketplace monitors to spot patterns.

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower.

      "NONINVASIVE BRAIN TECH AND AI MOVES ROBOTIC HAND WITH THOUGHT",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where else could robots detect damage inside boxes and make an impact",
      "Beyond warehouse automation, this technology opens the door to several other promising uses. In factory production lines, robots that detect damage inside boxes could inspect goods quickly and without opening packages, helping maintain high-quality standards.",
      "In assisted-living centers, the same approach might help ensure safety by checking the contents of containers without disturbing residents. Even in security screening, being able to see through sealed boxes could enhance threat detection without adding any strain on bandwidth since the system uses the same mmWave signals as existing technologies. The research team plans to further improve the resolution of mmNorm and boost its performance on less reflective objects, making it even more versatile for future applications.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",

      "AI AND LEARNING RETENTION: DOES CHATGPT HELP OR HURT?",
      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",
      "A man on the phone with customer service\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI tools, such as chatbots, are helpful and are not going away anytime soon. But customers still want to feel heard and understood. That usually means talking to a real person. The best approach is not to replace humans but to use both people and technology in the right ways. Let the chatbot handle the quick stuff. Bring in the human when the conversation really matters.",

      "Tesla has long promised to integrate solar panels and battery storage into its Supercharger stations. CEO Elon Musk envisioned a network where most stations could operate off-grid, powered by renewable energy. While a few stations received solar upgrades over the years, most remained reliant on conventional electricity sources.

      "The Oasis Supercharger is truly massive. It will eventually offer 168 charging stalls, with half of them already operational. The station is powered by an impressive 11 megawatts of solar panels, which include both ground-mounted arrays and solar canopies. These panels cover 30 acres of land, making it one of the largest solar-powered EV charging stations in the world. To store the energy generated by the solar farm, Tesla has installed 10 Megapacks, which together provide 39 megawatt-hours of battery capacity.",

      "Pulling into a station, swapping your electric car battery and getting back on the road in under two minutes is now a reality.",

      "ENERGY-SUCKING AI DATA CENTERS CAN LOOK HERE FOR POWER INSTEAD",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "What are swappable EV batteries?",
      "Swappable EV batteries are modular battery packs that can be quickly exchanged instead of recharged. CATL, a global leader in battery technology, created a system called Choco-SEB that allows drivers to replace a drained battery in about 100 seconds. This makes battery swapping a realistic alternative to traditional EV charging.",
      "Swappable EV battery on screen at launch event\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "How CATL's Choco-SEB battery system works",
      "CATL's Choco-SEB battery system is focused on speed and flexibility. It is designed to support a wide range of electric vehicles, from compact city cars to larger sedans. The system lets drivers swap batteries quickly and choose the setup that matches their needs best. With this technology, a single battery swap can deliver up to 373 miles of range, depending on the vehicle.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The Choco-SEB batteries are available in two sizes, making them adaptable for different car models. Drivers can install one, two or even three battery blocks, depending on how much driving range they want. For compact cars, the system can provide up to 311 miles of range, while midsize vehicles can achieve as much as 373 miles per swap. This flexibility makes the Choco-SEB system a practical solution for a wide variety of drivers and travel needs.",
      "Illustration of where swappable EV batteries are placed in a vehicle\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "CATL swappable EV batteries offer high-efficiency and safe chemistry",
      "The battery uses a blend of lithium iron phosphate and nickel manganese cobalt. This mix offers a balance of performance and safety, with an energy density of more than 160 Wh/kg and 325 Wh/L. The first car to launch with a Choco-SEB swappable EV battery is the Changan Oshan 520. It starts at around 166,800 yuan, or roughly $23,100. The vehicle offers a 320-mile range and is already gaining traction. Changan has delivered over 1,000 units and has received more than 15,000 orders.",

      "Battery swapping stations are expanding across China",
      "CATL is actively building a network of battery swap stations across China. As of now, 34 stations are operating in Chongqing. More than 50 are expected by the end of the year.",
      "By the end of 2025, CATL plans to have 1,000 stations across 31 cities. Each station is compact, requiring the space of just three parking spots, and they can hold up to 48 swappable EV batteries.",
      "CATL is working with major automakers, including GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW and BAIC. The company holds almost 29% of the global EV battery market. With the addition of swappable EV batteries, it is strengthening its position as a leader in the industry.",
      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "Why swappable EV batteries could change the industry",
      "Swappable EV batteries address one of the biggest challenges facing electric vehicles: long charging times. Instead of waiting 30 minutes or more, drivers can swap batteries in minutes and get back on the road with the ease of a gas-powered car.",
      "The concept is gaining traction in Asian markets and holds promise for global expansion. In the U.S., however, challenges such as vehicle compatibility, automaker collaboration, infrastructure needs and consumer acceptance remain significant.",
      "Some U.S.-based pilots and partnerships, including Stellantis collaborating with Ample for a fleet in Spain, point to growing interest. Still, CATL's Choco-SEB battery swap system has not been announced for rollout in the U.S.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CATL's goal is to make electric vehicle ownership easier and more appealing. Swappable EV batteries give drivers the flexibility to power up without plugging in. With more stations on the way and compatibility across a wide range of cars, this system could redefine what it means to drive electric. While this technology isn't coming to the U.S. just yet, American EV manufacturers may want to take note, as swappable battery tech could be the game-changer drivers have been waiting for.",

      "Research shows that despite widespread awareness of the risks, teens and phone use while driving remains a persistent and deadly problem. (iStock/Getty Images)",
      "How widespread is teen phone use while driving?",
      "As of 2025, distracted driving remains a major safety concern in the United States. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, taking your eyes off the road for just five seconds at 55 mph is like driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed. In recent years, distracted driving has contributed to over 3,200 deaths and hundreds of thousands of crashes annually in the U.S., averaging nearly 900 incidents every day.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A new study led by Dr. Rebecca Robbins at Brigham and Women's Hospital, part of the Mass General Brigham system, and published in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention, found that teens spend an average of 21% of every car trip looking at their phones. That's roughly one out of every five minutes behind the wheel. Even more alarming, more than a quarter of teens admitted to glancing at their phones for two seconds or longer at a time, long enough to dramatically increase the risk of a crash.",
      "Why do teens and phone use while driving go hand in hand?",

      "This means that the urge to stay entertained or connected often outweighs safety concerns, even when teens are aware of the risks.",
      "A teen texting and driving. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What drives teens' and phone use while driving behavior?",
      "Researchers used the Integrated Model of Behavioral Prediction to investigate what motivates teenagers to use their phones while driving. They found that many teens believe using their phones makes driving more enjoyable or helps them multitask. Social influence also plays a significant role; when friends or family members use their phones while driving, teens are more likely to adopt the same behavior. Additionally, many teens feel confident in their ability to manage both driving and phone use, which leads them to underestimate the real dangers involved.",

      "Reducing teen phone use behind the wheel requires a combination of practical strategies, open communication and positive role modeling. Here are some effective tips to help keep young drivers focused and safe:",
      "1. Set \"Do Not Disturb\": Activate \"Do Not Disturb\" mode before driving to block notifications and reduce temptation.",
      "2. Keep phones out of reach:\u00a0Store your phone in the glove box or back seat so it's not easily accessible.",
      "3. Talk about risks:\u00a0Parents and schools should regularly discuss the dangers of distracted driving with teens.",
      "4. Model safe behavior:\u00a0Adults should avoid using phones while driving to set a positive example.",
      "5. Use monitoring apps: Consider apps that block phone use or track driving habits for added accountability.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 09:00:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Security researchers uncovered a flaw in Windows 11 that allows attackers to disable Secure Boot using Microsoft-signed tools, requiring manual updates to protect against bootkits.",
    "story": [
      "Panelists Brian Brenberg and Ricky Cobb comment on the Newark airport disruptions on \u2018Fox News Saturday Night.\u2019",
      "Microsoft hasn't received much love for Windows 11, with many users still reluctant to ditch Windows 10 even four years after the newer OS launched. The main reasons include Microsoft's constant push to use its own services, strict hardware requirements and questionable interface changes.",
      "But if you're looking for yet another reason to dislike Windows 11, security researchers recently uncovered a critical vulnerability affecting Secure Boot. This feature is supposed to prevent malware from loading during startup. Now, hackers can bypass that protection and silently infect systems. The flaw allows attackers to disable Secure Boot on nearly any modern Windows PC or server, leaving even fully updated devices open to stealthy, undetectable malware.",

      "WINDOWS PCS AT RISK AS NEW TOOL DISARMS BUILT-IN SECURITY",
      "Windows PC\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the Secure Boot vulnerability in Windows 11?",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-3052, was discovered by firmware security firm Binarly. They found that a legitimate BIOS update tool signed by Microsoft could be abused to tamper with the Windows boot process. Once exploited, the flaw allows attackers to shut off Secure Boot entirely. In the wrong hands, this vulnerability could lead to a new generation of malware. These threats could bypass even the most advanced antivirus or detection software.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers can abuse Microsoft-signed tools to shut down Secure Boot",
      "At the center of the issue is a BIOS-flashing utility built for rugged tablets. Microsoft signed it using its UEFI CA 2011 certificate. Because that certificate is trusted on nearly every Secure Boot-enabled system, the tool can run without raising alarms. The danger lies in how the tool handles a specific NVRAM variable. Binarly's researchers found that it reads this variable blindly, without checking what's inside. That small oversight opens the door to a serious exploit.",
      "In a demonstration, Binarly used a proof-of-concept attack to change this variable's value. By setting it to zero, they were able to overwrite a global setting critical to enforcing Secure Boot. That action completely disabled Secure Boot protections. Once that happens, unsigned UEFI modules can run freely. Attackers can then install stealthy, low-level malware known as bootkits, malware that operates below the Windows operating system itself. For hackers, this method offers the ultimate persistence.",
      "Windows laptop\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Microsoft released a fix-but you must act to stay protected",
      "Binarly reported the flaw to CERT/CC in February 2025. At first, it appeared to affect only a single module. But Microsoft's deeper investigation uncovered a bigger problem. The same vulnerability affected 14 modules signed with the same trusted certificate. Microsoft responded in June 2025 by revoking the cryptographic hashes of all 14 affected modules. These hashes were added to the Secure Boot revocation list, known as the dbx. This prevents the modules from running during startup. However, this protection is not automatic. Unless users or organizations manually apply the updated dbx, their systems remain vulnerable, even with other patches installed.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How long has this Windows tool been circulating?",
      "Binarly revealed that the vulnerable tool had been online since late 2022. Someone uploaded it to VirusTotal in 2024, but it went unnoticed for months. At this point, it's unclear whether any attackers have used it in the wild. We reached out to Microsoft for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Six essential tips to protect your Windows 11 PC from hackers",
      "Protecting your PC doesn't have to be complicated. Just follow these simple steps to keep hackers at bay and your information safe.",
      "1. Keep your computer updated:\u00a0Software updates aren\u2019t just about new features. They fix serious security issues. In this case, Microsoft has already released a fix for the Secure Boot vulnerability, but it only works if your system is fully updated. Just head to your settings, open Windows Update, and make sure everything is installed. A lot of people delay updates for weeks, but these patches are the first line of defense against threats like this.",
      "2. Don\u2019t install tools you don\u2019t fully understand:\u00a0It might be tempting to download apps that claim to speed up your computer or fix problems, especially ones recommended in YouTube videos or tech forums. But that\u2019s exactly how a lot of threats sneak in. This particular vulnerability came from a legitimate-looking tool that was misused. So, if you\u2019re not sure what something does or if it asks for permission to change how your system boots up, skip it. Or ask someone who knows more, before you click anything.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and leave it running:\u00a0Even though this new threat targets something deep inside the system, having strong antivirus protection still helps catch related malware. If you're on Windows, Defender is already built in and does a decent job. But if you don\u2019t want to rely on Windows\u2019 built-in tools, use a third-party antivirus.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0\u00a0by visiting\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "4. Restart your computer every now and then:\u00a0This one sounds basic, but it matters. A lot of updates don\u2019t fully apply until after a restart. If you keep putting your computer to sleep or hibernating it for days at a time, your system might still be stuck in an unsafe state. Try to restart it at least every couple of days, or whenever an update asks for it.",
      "5. Don\u2019t ignore warnings from Windows or your antivirus:\u00a0If something pops up telling you a file looks dangerous or that an update is needed, pay attention. It\u2019s easy to get into the habit of closing these messages without reading them, but that\u2019s how problems get missed. If a warning looks confusing or too technical, take a screenshot or a photo, and ask someone for help. The important thing is not to ignore it and move on.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from people-search sites:\u00a0Even if hackers don't directly target you through the Secure Boot flaw, many cyberattacks begin by gathering personal information that's easily found online. This can include your full name, address, phone number and even the names of your relatives. Data broker websites collect and publish this information without your consent, putting you at greater risk. Using a personal data removal service helps you reduce your online exposure and make it harder for bad actors to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Secure Boot is supposed to be a final safeguard, a last barrier that ensures only verified code can load when a device starts. But this vulnerability shows how easily that trust can be broken. If a single signed utility can disable the entire system\u2019s protection, then the foundation of device security starts to look worryingly thin.",

      "Hamas has long used humanitarian assistance as a means of control over Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and as a tool for recruitment, going so far as to threaten starving civilians from accepting\u00a0GHF food aid for their families in late May, telling them they \"will pay the price, and we will take the necessary measures.\"",
      "The GHF has delivered some 70 million meals to between 800,000 and 1 million Palestinians, Moore confirmed.",

      "The U.N. did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about whether it was the IDF or Hamas that was on the firing end of the gun, and whether these deaths occurred as a direct result of civilians seeking aid, chaotic eruptions that ensued outside of distribution centers, or if these were deaths occurred amid the continued war as civilians were in the process of heading to distributions centers.",
      "The IDF earlier this month said that following an investigation into civilian casualties reported at aid distribution sites, it had issued new orders to its South Command based on \"lessons learned.\"",
      "The GHF this week announced a second phase in its aid delivery system that could lower the threats civilians face when seeking aid, by distributing supplies directly through community leaders across Gaza \u2013 meaning there could be less travel involved for civilians in need.",
      "But the GHF also fervently rejects the U.N. death toll figures and Moore maintains that no deaths have occurred on or near their distribution sites.",

      "\"I have been very clear that the U.N. cannot do humanitarian work alone in Gaza, we need partners,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Fox News Digital. \"All that we ask is that these partners operate under the globally accepted humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.\"",
      "Though both sides ultimately have the same goal, there appears to be an increasing impasse over how to provide stable aid for Palestinians who continue to live in extremely dire situations.",

      "Patrick Cunningham, the agent who oversaw the arrest of \u00d6zt\u00fcrk in March, told the court in Boston that he had consulted a Department of Homeland Security attorney to check that arresting her based on her visa being revoked was legal.

      "Cunningham\u2019s testimony is part of the second week of a trial in which five scholar groups, including the Harvard University faculty chapter of the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association, are alleging that the detentions of  \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and others and attempted deportations violated the First Amendment. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was grabbed by agents off a Massachusetts street in late March, with the DHS accusing her of engaging \u201cin activities in support of Hamas.\u201d",

But after Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, the agency held several meetings about these types of arrests and how they now would be a priority. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s arrest was based on orders that came from DHS headquarters, he said.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t recall a time that it\u2019s come top down like this with a visa revocation\u2014 under my purview anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the superiors that were inquiring about this, it made it a priority, because we work for them.\u201d",

      "The cuts could also lead to nearly 100,000 more hospitalizations each year, the report found, and around 1.6 million people may delay seeking care.",
      "The projections are at odds with comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who downplayed the bill\u2019s impact during an interview with Fox Business Network\u2019s Larry Kudlow on Monday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to cut Medicaid and there\u2019s nobody who is going to die from this,\u201d Kennedy said.",

      "Trump\u2019s legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d \u2014 includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to the program, mainly through work requirements and reduced federal funding. Most of the changes aren\u2019t slated to take effect until 2027 or 2028.",
      "The new report\u2019s projections are based on an earlier estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that found changes to Medicaid could result in 7.6 million people in the U.S. losing their health insurance by 2034.",
      "The coverage losses are expected to lead people to delay seeking care because they can no longer afford it, said the report\u2019s author, Dr. Sanjay Basu, the chief medical officer at Waymark, a company that aims to improve access and care to Medicaid patients. For many, he said, that delay would result in people getting sicker, leading to hospitalizations and death.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to worry about cost or coverage,\u201d he said, so they avoid care until \u201cthey end up hospitalized or found at home, dead, from an uncontrolled condition.\u201d",
      "Basu added that the report\u2019s projections are likely \u201can underestimate,\u201d noting that it doesn\u2019t take into account changes in the bill to the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The estimates also assume that states will be able to make the required changes to their Medicaid programs \u2014 such as setting up systems to track work requirements \u2014 within the two- to three-year time period, he said.",
      "A worst-case scenario in the report projects double the number of additional annual deaths \u2014 around 2,000 \u2014 and estimates that up to 2.5 million people will delay seeking care.",
      "\u201cThis stuff is actually quite complicated for a state, and the deadlines are not too long from now,\u201d Basu said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure how many people will be dropped, not because they\u2019re no longer eligible, but because they procedurally can\u2019t get through things.\u201d",
      "Other health impacts",
      "Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at the health policy research group KFF, said other studies have repeatedly shown that uninsured people are less likely than those with insurance to get preventive care and treatments for major health conditions and chronic diseases.",
      "Almost a third of uninsured adults report delaying or forgoing care due to cost, compared with 6% of insured adults, according to a KFF report.",
      "\u201cThe consequences [of delaying care] can be severe,\u201d she said, \u201cparticularly when preventable conditions or chronic diseases go undetected.\u201d",
      "In addition to people delaying care, 1.9 million people each year are projected to skip, delay or not take their medication as prescribed, according to the new report.",
      "The cuts are also projected to lead to an additional $7.6 billion in medical debt in the U.S.",
      "By 2034, more than 100 rural hospitals could be at risk of closure, the report found. More than 300,000 jobs could be lost, and the economy could shrink by about $135 billion, the report said. (In the worst-case scenario, the job losses were 408,000 and the economy took a $182 billion hit.)",
      "Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a physician and health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said people often don\u2019t find out they\u2019ve lost coverage until they go see their doctor and can face huge bills.",
      "Sommers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 looking at the impact of Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid work requirements. The program ended after only 10 months, before any clear data on hospitalizations or deaths was available.",

      "This article describes some scenes in \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201cF1: The Movie.\u201d",
      "In the United States, Lois Lane kisses Superman for a steamy 33 seconds. For those watching the new Superman blockbuster in India, however, when the hero leans in to kiss his paramour, the movie jumps forward abruptly.",
      "That\u2019s because Indian censors have deemed the midair kiss as being \u201coverly sensual.\u201d They have also objected to other parts of the James Gunn blockbuster, shaving 8 seconds off here and there to achieve a 13+ rating, according to local reports and filmgoers.",
      "\u201cThere was an abrupt cut, and it just felt very out of place,\u201d said Kautuk Kundan, 27, who runs an artificial intelligence startup in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru and watched the film over the weekend. \u201cThere were two or three similar cuts in the movie wherein the movie is progressing, and suddenly there\u2019s an abrupt cut, and then it\u2019s the next scene.\u201d",
      "Intervention by authorities has Indian moviegoers fuming, who accuse the censors of making moralistic changes while adopting a double standard for Bollywood films, which are often laced with innuendos, misogyny and sensual scenes.",
      "Indian filmmakers and distributors have long had a strained relationship with India\u2019s censor authority, the Central Board of Film Certification. It\u2019s well expected that if a movie contains any explicit scenes, kisses or profanity, those scenes will be cut. Showing affection is limited to long hugs, with the justification given that India\u2019s population is still mostly conservative and religious, and the scenes could be uncomfortable.",
      "The new Superman film isn\u2019t alone in being hit by censors."

      "Three current and former Louisiana police chiefs, a U.S. marshal and a businessman have been federally charged with participating in an immigrant visa fraud scheme, prosecutors announced Wednesday.",
      "A federal grand jury in Shreveport returned a 62-count indictment against the five people on July 2, Acting U.S. Attorney Alexander Van Hook for the Western District of Louisiana said in a news conference Wednesday.",
      "The police chiefs took bribes in exchange for filing false police reports that would allow noncitizens to seek a visa that lets certain crime victims stay in the U.S., Van Hook said.",
      "The five defendants are: Chad Doyle, the chief of police in Oakdale; Michael Slaney, a marshal from the Ward 5 Marshal\u2019s office in Oakdale; Glynn Dixon, the chief of police in Forest Hill; Tebo Onishea, the former chief of police in Glenmora; and Chandrakant Patel, a businessman from Oakdale. They were each charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud and other charges, prosecutors said in a news release.",
      "Patel was further charged with one count of bribery, 24 counts of mail fraud and eight counts of money laundering.",
      "Doyle and Dixon were further charged with six counts of visa fraud, six counts of mail fraud and one count of money laundering. Slaney was also charged with six counts of visa fraud, six counts of mail fraud, and two counts of money laundering. Onishea was additionally charged with six counts of visa fraud and six counts of mail fraud.",
      "For a decade, from December 2015 to at least this month, prosecutors alleged Patel was a fixer who unlawfully procured nonimmigrant U-visas with the help of law enforcement officials.",
      "The U nonimmigrant status visa is for victims of certain crimes who help law enforcement or government officials investigate those crimes. Part of the application process includes a signature of an authorized official or law enforcement agency confirming the individual was the victim of a qualifying crime, prosecutors said.",
      "Individuals seeking U-visas would contact Patel to be named as \u201cvictims\u201d in police reports of an armed robbery, so they could submit applications for U-visas, the indictment alleged.",
      "Those individuals allegedly paid Patel thousands of dollars to participate in the scheme, and Patel would ask alleged co-conspirators Doyle, Slaney, Dixon and Onishea to write false police reports naming the individuals as victims of armed robberies, and provide certification and supporting documents, prosecutors said.",
      "Together they \u201cauthored, facilitated, produced and authenticated false police reports\u201d in several central Louisiana parishes, the news release said.",
      "\"There was an unusual concentration of armed robberies, a large number of armed robberies of people that were not from Louisiana,\" Van Hook said. \"Well, in fact, the armed robberies never took place, and those listed in the applications were never victims.\"",
      "Patel allegedly offered to pay an agent of the Rapides Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office $5,000 on Feb. 18, \u201cintending to influence and reward said agent in exchange for a fraudulent police report,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Van Hook said Patel allegedly paid the law enforcement officers $5,000 for each foreign national placed on police reports, and that were hundreds of such reports.",
      "From Sept. 27, 2023 to Dec. 26, 2024, Doyle Slaney, Dixon and Onishea allegedly submitted false statements in immigration applications by signing I-918B forms despite knowing the individuals were never victims of crimes.",
      "The investigation opened following a tip last July from Citizenship and Immigration Services, and was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI and IRS, along with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Van Hook said the men were arrested Tuesday by federal law enforcement agents and search warrants were executed at multiple locations including the Oakdale and Forest Hill police departments and a Subway sandwich shop in Oakdale operated by Patel. Officials said Wednesday all were released except Patel.",
      "No attorneys were listed for the defendants in the online court docket. NBC News has reached out to the five men for comment.",
      "The mail fraud charge stems from the five men sending out documents by the U.S. Postal Service.",
      "If convicted the defendants each face up to five years in prison on the conspiracy charge, up to 10 years on the visa fraud charge, up to 20 years on the mail fraud charge, and Patel up to 10 years the bribery charge. They also could be ordered to pay a fine of $250,000 on each count.",

      "Amid an explosive fight on Capitol Hill over whether the Trump administration should release records related to Jeffrey Epstein, the family of the disgraced financier\u2019s convicted right-hand woman is saying she \"did not receive a fair trial.\"",
      "Maxwell, 63, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for recruiting and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, several years after he died in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. She is currently being held in federal prison in Florida and has filed a petition with the Supreme Court to vacate her 2021 conviction.",
      "\"Her legal team continues to fight her case in the Courts and will file its reply in short order to the Government\u2019s opposition in the US Supreme Court,\" Maxwell\u2019s siblings said in a Tuesday statement released on a website dedicated to her case.",
      "The family\u2019s statement in defense of Maxwell also comes amid a recent politically charged fight over the release of documents in Epstein's case.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s attorney, David Oscar Markus, said in the statement that he would be \"surprised if President Trump knew his lawyers were asking the Supreme Court to let the government break a deal,\" referring to a 2007 agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida.",
      "\"He\u2019s the ultimate dealmaker \u2014 and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d agree that when the United States gives its word, it should keep it,\"  Markus added. \"With all the talk about who\u2019s being prosecuted and who isn\u2019t, it\u2019s especially unfair that Ghislaine Maxwell remains in prison based on a promise the US government made and broke.\"",
      "The family, who said they \"profoundly concur\" with Markus' statement, added that Maxwell's legal team might file a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, which \u2014 if granted \u2014 would allow Maxwell to appear before a judge to determine if their detention is lawful.",
      "The Department of Justice did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Maxwell, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, petitioned the Supreme Court in April to scrap her conviction. Her legal team argued that Epstein's non-prosecution and plea agreement with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2008 protected Maxwell from future prosecution.",
      "\"Despite the existence of a non-prosecution agreement promising in plain language that the United States would not prosecute any co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein, the United States in fact prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell as a co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein,\" her attorneys wrote in the petition.",
      "Lower courts have rejected Maxwell's attorneys' arguments, and on Monday, the Department of Justice urged the Supreme Court to follow suit.",
      "The DOJ argued that the non-prosecution agreement in Florida does not protect Maxwell or other co-conspirators from being prosecuted in other jurisdictions around the country. Maxwell was prosecuted on different charges by federal officials in Manhattan.",
      "\"The NPA\u2019s coconspirators clause, which 'also agrees' to forgo certain prosecution of coconspirators, cannot reasonably be construed as reflecting some 'global' scope broader than the Florida-based state and federal charges that Epstein resolved for himself,\" the brief states. \"It would be extremely strange if the NPA left Epstein himself open to federal prosecution in another district \u2014 as eventually occurred \u2014 while protecting his coconspirators from prosecution anywhere.\"",
      "The Florida agreement was in a different jurisdiction and pertained to charges other than those Epstein ultimately faced in New York.",
      "As Maxwell continues to fight to appeal her New York conviction, a contentious battle is brewing within the Republican party over whether the Trump administration should release further information on its case against Epstein.",
      "The case against Epstein ended after he was found dead in a New York City jail cell in 2019. A medical examiner\u2019s office ruled Epstein\u2019s death a suicide.",
      "But for years, the nature of Epstein's death, the billionaire's high-profile contacts, and the graphic details of his alleged crimes have fueled conspiracy theories and demands that the government release all it knows about the case. Trump himself helped fuel these theories in the past, saying during his most recent presidential campaign that he would have \u201cno problem\u201d looking into an Epstein client list.",
      "The Department of Justice, however, said last week it would not release any additional files related to the case against Epstein, referred to as the \"Epstein files.\"",
      "In a two-page memo, Attorney General Pam Bondi disputed the existence of a \"client list\" of powerful individuals who participated in Epstein's crimes. The memo said that there was no \"credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals.\"",
      "The development prompted outrage among some Republican lawmakers and prominent right-wing media figures, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson. Part of the outrage stems from Bondi's past comments that she had a \"client list\" related to Epstein sitting on her desk.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson on Tuesday that Bondi should come forward and explain why she declined to do so.",
      "Republicans have also been calling for Maxwell to appear and testify before Congress, which the speaker suggested he was in favor of.",
      "\"I\u2019m for transparency,\" Johnson said. \"It\u2019s a very delicate subject but we should put everything out there and let the people decide.\"",
      "After years of promising to release the files, President Donald Trump has recently pushed back against Republican criticism and sought to downplay the significance of the documents.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called the fanfare around the documents a \"scam\" and \"bulls***.\" (The president previously knew Epstein, but later had a falling out with the disgraced financier. No evidence has surfaced to suggest Trump was involved in Epstein\u2019s criminal activity.)",
      "\"I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country\u2019s history, and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,\" Trump on his social media site, Truth Social.",
      "\"Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don\u2019t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don\u2019t want their support anymore!\" he added."

      "Donald Trump is once again angry, but this time his ire is directed at a new audience: his own MAGA supporters.",
      "In a blistering post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, Trump continued to push his backers to stop talking about Jeffrey Epstein, an issue that has driven what appears to be one of the most significant rifts between him and the political movement he built.",
      "\u201cLet those weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don\u2019t want their support anymore.\u201d",
      "Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office that he had \u201clost faith in certain people\u201d because \u201cthey got duped by the Democrats\u201d on the issue \u2014 even though it was Republicans who primarily pushed for more on the Epstein files.",
      "Trump\u2019s message Wednesday was a significant escalation, reflecting that his supporters aren\u2019t all following his lead and adopting his messaging as they usually do. It\u2019s also left MAGA-aligned media at a loss of what to do, torn between much of the base that continues to call for more documents related to Epstein,  the late financier and convicted sex offender, and Trump, who insists they should drop the issue.",
      "\u201cThis is a major problem and could hurt turnout in the midterms,\u201d said a Republican strategist familiar with Trump\u2019s political operation. \u201cIt signals betrayal to those who believed the president would expose the deep state. His team made promises, then doubled down.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor the base that believes the deep state is real and that Epstein was part of it, this feels like the ultimate knife in the back,\u201d the person added.",
      "The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "MAGA media in a bind",
      "The trouble in moving on from Epstein is reflected in MAGA-friendly media.",
      "The major MAGA media figures have built huge audiences by backing Trump, no matter the policy shift or controversy. When Trump needs cover with his political base, those figures have been a reliable go-to to help get his supporters back on message.",
      "Charlie Kirk, a vocal Trump supporter and founder of the influential Turning Points USA, on Monday said he was done talking about the issue.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m done talking about Epstein for the time being,\u201d Kirk told his large audience. \u201cI\u2019m going to trust my friends in the administration, I\u2019m gonna trust my friends in the government to do what needs to be done, solve it, ball\u2019s in their hands.\u201d",
      "One day later, he said an assertion that he was no longer talking about Epstein at all is \u201cfake news.\u201d What he meant, Kirk explained Tuesday, was that he was done talking about Epstein that day. He pointed to the portion of his remarks in which he said \u201cfor the time being,\u201d which he falsely claimed media outlets ignored.",
      "\u201cAgain, no one covered the second part of the statement,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cNo one covered it. The thing has, like, 10 millions views on social media.\u201d",
      "Last week, the Justice Department released a two-page memo saying that after an \u201cexhaustive review,\u201d officials had determined there is no evidence of an \u201cincriminating \u2018client list.\u2019\u201d MAGA outrage swiftly targeted Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had indicated during a Fox News interview in February that she had Epstein\u2019s client list \u201con my desk\u201d at that very moment.",
      "In a post Saturday night, Trump expressed support for Bondi, who is the focus of MAGA\u2019s ire: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with my \u2018boys\u2019 and, in some cases, \u2018gals?\u2019 They\u2019re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!\u201d",
      "Fox News, still the biggest presence in conservative media, has all but abandoned talking about Epstein, even though it had long provided significant coverage of the issue. A Fox News spokesperson did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Tuesday, prominent conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who relentlessly spread misinformation that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, said he was no longer going to \u201ctalk about the Epstein files,\u201d and it\u2019s \u201ctime to move on.\u201d",
      "But in what represents a new wrinkle in MAGA media, other conservative media personalities are continuing to press the issue, a sign that the Epstein scandal has a different level of staying power than past Trump-MAGA dust-ups.",
      "Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, an organization that is trying to obtain Epstein investigation documents, maintains that there\u2019s a \u201cstraightforward solution\u201d to the saga, but it requires more transparency.",
      "\u201cJust give us the records under FOIA,\u201d he said Wednesday on \u201cWar Room,\u201d a popular podcast hosted by MAGA influencer and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. \u201cDescribe what the records are. If they\u2019re withholding anything, tell us why. And there\u2019s a court process for it. If we don\u2019t like it, we can challenge it.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut at least it\u2019s a transparency that we don\u2019t have currently because of the awful memo that was sent out,\u201d he added.",
      "Megyn Kelly, a high-profile conservative commentator and Trump supporter, agreed.",
      "\u201cThere are some right-wing pundits online now who are saying \u2018no one cares about Jeffrey Epstein,\u2019\u201d she said on her show Tuesday. \u201cAnd, uh, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d",
      "Kelly was at a Kirk-hosted conference in Tampa over the weekend where she spent most of her time on stage focused on Epstein and trashing Bondi.",
      "Newsmax, a conservative TV network, has also continued to focus on the issue, hammering Bondi\u2019s role even after Trump has publicly supported her. On Tuesday, host Rob Finnerty blasted Bondi and said if she does not offer more information, the network will call on her to resign.",
      "\u201cEither the people Donald Trump appointed to get to the truth are actively covering up a child sex ring and know they are doing it, and in the process of doing it they are protecting very powerful, very wealthy people, or Pam Bondi very simply and very plainly overpromised, then underdelivered,\u201d he said.",
      "'It's Epstein, over and over again'",
      "Trump\u2019s message over the years has been inconsistent on Epstein, who was accused of running a sex trafficking network. Trump called him a \u201cterrific guy\u201d in 2002, but said in 2019 that they had a \u201cfalling out a long time ago.\u201d He has insisted he had no knowledge of what Epstein was doing.",
      "Trump helped fuel conspiracy theories about the Epstein files, saying as a candidate that he would release more documents.",
      "As president, Trump has said that there are no more documents to release and that the issue is over. At other times, he has said that the files exist, but claimed they were forged by Democrats and his political enemies, so they should not be released.",
      "\u201cFor years, it\u2019s Epstein, over and over again. Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, [former FBI director James] Comey, [former CIA director John] Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden administration,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday night blaming the files on Democrats.",
      "Fanning the flames of the Epstein files helped Trump build his base, but now that he has pulled the rug out from under its feet, it is proving to be a challenge for a president who famously said that essentially nothing could make his loyal supporters leave him.",
      "\u201cThe administration perpetuated much of this narrative from the outside, and there remains many legitimate questions. But once in power, they continued to feed the monster and the monster is now feeding on the administration\u2019s credibility. Trump famously said the base would not leave even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, but now the MAGA base is irate and incredulous he can\u2019t shoot straight on Epstein,\u201d Republican strategist Matthew Bartlett said.",
      "Compounding the problem Tuesday, some prominent House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pushed for more Epstein documents to be released, in direct defiance of Trump. Johnson also said that Bondi \u201cneeds to come forward and explain\u201d her contradictions on the issue, and that former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently in federal prison, should testify before Congress.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for transparency,\u201d Johnson told conservative media personality Benny Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate subject but we should put everything out there and let the people decide.\u201d",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he found it \"a little difficult to believe, the idea that the DOJ and the FBI who prosecuted cases relating to this don't have any idea who Epstein's clients were.\"",
      "\"My view is make public, everything you can make public. That's what the president said yesterday. I think that that would be \u2014 they want my advice and they don't, but if DOJ were asking for my advice, that's what I would say \u2014 make it all public,\" he told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The MAGA political base has had small fights and disagreements over the years, but nothing has consumed and divided it like the Epstein issue. Grassroots supporters say they feel betrayed by a president who long promised transparency on the issue, and the vast MAGA political and media infrastructure has split on the issue.",
      "Giancarlo Sopo, who led Hispanic media for Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, said the president should ignore those voices.",

      "The Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic policy bill could result in more than 1,000 additional deaths every year, according to a report published Wednesday in JAMA Health Forum.",
      "The cuts could also lead to nearly 100,000 more hospitalizations each year, the report found, and around 1.6 million people may delay seeking care.",
      "The projections are at odds with comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who downplayed the bill\u2019s impact during an interview with Fox Business Network\u2019s Larry Kudlow on Monday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to cut Medicaid and there\u2019s nobody who is going to die from this,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
      "Wednesday's study reaches a similar conclusion to an analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in June, which also found that the cuts could lead to thousands of preventable deaths annually because people delay care and get sicker.",
      "Medicaid is jointly funded by states and the federal government.",
      "Trump\u2019s legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d \u2014 includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to the program, mainly through work requirements and reduced federal funding. Most of the changes aren\u2019t slated to take effect until 2027 or 2028.",
      "The new report\u2019s projections are based on an earlier estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that found changes to Medicaid could result in 7.6 million people in the U.S. losing their health insurance by 2034.",
      "The coverage losses are expected to lead people to delay seeking care because they can no longer afford it, said the report\u2019s author, Dr. Sanjay Basu, the chief medical officer at Waymark, a company that aims to improve access and care to Medicaid patients. For many, he said, that delay would result in people getting sicker, leading to hospitalizations and death.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to worry about cost or coverage,\u201d he said, so they avoid care until \u201cthey end up hospitalized or found at home, dead, from an uncontrolled condition.\u201d",
      "Basu added that the report\u2019s projections are likely \u201can underestimate,\u201d noting that it doesn\u2019t take into account changes in the bill to the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The estimates also assume that states will be able to make the required changes to their Medicaid programs \u2014 such as setting up systems to track work requirements \u2014 within the two- to three-year time period, he said.",
      "A worst-case scenario in the report projects double the number of additional annual deaths \u2014 around 2,000 \u2014 and estimates that up to 2.5 million people will delay seeking care.",
      "\u201cThis stuff is actually quite complicated for a state, and the deadlines are not too long from now,\u201d Basu said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure how many people will be dropped, not because they\u2019re no longer eligible, but because they procedurally can\u2019t get through things.\u201d",
      "Other health impacts",
      "Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at the health policy research group KFF, said other studies have repeatedly shown that uninsured people are less likely than those with insurance to get preventive care and treatments for major health conditions and chronic diseases.",
      "Almost a third of uninsured adults report delaying or forgoing care due to cost, compared with 6% of insured adults, according to a KFF report.",
      "\u201cThe consequences [of delaying care] can be severe,\u201d she said, \u201cparticularly when preventable conditions or chronic diseases go undetected.\u201d",
      "In addition to people delaying care, 1.9 million people each year are projected to skip, delay or not take their medication as prescribed, according to the new report.",
      "The cuts are also projected to lead to an additional $7.6 billion in medical debt in the U.S.",
      "By 2034, more than 100 rural hospitals could be at risk of closure, the report found. More than 300,000 jobs could be lost, and the economy could shrink by about $135 billion, the report said. (In the worst-case scenario, the job losses were 408,000 and the economy took a $182 billion hit.)",
      "Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a physician and health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said people often don\u2019t find out they\u2019ve lost coverage until they go see their doctor and can face huge bills.",
      "Sommers published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 looking at the impact of Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid work requirements. The program ended after only 10 months, before any clear data on hospitalizations or deaths was available.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of different ways people can experience this type of bureaucracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe red tape, starting with just not even understanding what the policy means and how it applies to them.\u201d"

      "There are \u201ctwo different Americas\u201d when it comes to birth control, family planning experts say.",
      "A new report finds that only a third of states protect access to affordable contraception through their policies, such as Medicaid expansion or requiring health insurers to pay for prescriptions for months at a time.",
      "The report, released Wednesday, analyzed current birth control policies across the 50 states and Washington, D.C. It comes as finding affordable birth control becomes more difficult for many women across the country and as conservative state and federal lawmakers look to limit access to some forms of contraception.",
      "The report \u2014 a state-by-state contraceptive policy scorecard \u2014 shows how important local legislation is to family planning and health care.",
      "\u201cSeeing the full picture across all 50 states and D.C. really solidified how uneven access is,\u201d said Christine Power, a senior policy adviser for the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit that analyzes population data from around the world and published the report.",
      "The report found that state-level policies typically fall into three categories of access:",
      "Affordability. The scorecard tracked whether states have expanded Medicaid or enacted policies that require insurers to fully cover contraception. Medicaid is the main source of funding for family planning services for low-income people, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. Previous research has indicated that in states that expanded access to Medicaid, the number of prescriptions for birth control increased. Availability.

The scorecard measured whether public schools in the state teach medically accurate, comprehensive sex education and whether parents can opt-out of the classes for their children. Restrictions to birth control include whether minors are able to get birth control without parental permission and whether doctors or pharmacists are allowed to refuse birth control prescriptions based on personal beliefs.",

      "\u201cAffordability policies had the biggest weight on access, that was bigger than the access policies,\u201d Power said. Power said she was surprised by how many states scored poorly, not necessarily because they\u2019re highly restrictive toward family planning care, but because they \u201csimply haven\u2019t acted at all.\u201d",
      "Power and her team evaluated how state-level policies altered access in each state, both on their own and when they were layered with others. They found that 16 states and Washington, D.C. made birth control easily accessible and affordable. Sixteen restricted access and 18 fell in the middle.",
      "All 16 protective states had one thing in common: they had adopted Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act, which has allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to more adults with low incomes. None of the 16 restrictive states \u2014 including Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi and Wyoming, which ranked the highest \u2014 expanded Medicaid.",
      "States with the most favorable environment for birth control are California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The 18 states that fell in the middle category spanned the political spectrum, from reliably red states like West Virginia to liberal strongholds like Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cYour state-level context really does matter a lot for what your access to contraception looks like. That is especially true for vulnerable people, for people who are on state or public health insurance and for minors who don\u2019t have as much say in their health care,\u201d said Leslie Root, an associate director of the CU Population Center at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved with the report.",
      "Root said the report offers a good synthesis of the layers of legal barriers that play into whether or not a person can get birth control. It can range from what students are taught about contraception in school, to whether they can get a 12-month supply of birth control or whether they can get the type of birth control that works best for them.",
      "\u201cPeople can really be living in two different Americas,\u201d Root said. \u201cThis is a very stark illustration of that.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump has a Texas-sized conundrum on his hands as Republicans prepare for a Senate primary in the state, with GOP Sen. John Cornyn making his case for the White House to get involved as he tries to fend off a challenge from state Attorney General Ken Paxton.",
      "But, so far, Trump is staying on the sidelines.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve talked to him about it a number of times. He is not ready to make that endorsement,\u201d Cornyn told NBC News on Tuesday. \u201cI think as we start advertising and closing the gap in the polls, hopefully he\u2019ll see fit to make that endorsement, but we can\u2019t wait.\u201d",
      "\u201cI pointed out to him, and he knows this, that if he endorsed me, the race would be over,\u201d Cornyn later added.",
      "But Cornyn is struggling in recent primary polling, as Paxton has pitched himself as the true exemplar of the party\u2019s MAGA wing. Some Republicans are concerned that Paxton \u2014 a conservative firebrand with no shortage of personal controversies, including some that led to an impeachment push by a number of fellow Republicans in 2023 \u2014 could be a problematic general election candidate who would force national Republicans to spend millions to defend the longtime red seat.",
      "Those concerns won\u2019t let up with the latest round of fundraising figures, released Tuesday night. Paxton lapped the senator in direct fundraising to their campaigns, though Cornyn\u2019s entire political operation raised a significant sum.",
      "The race came up at a White House meeting last week between Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, staffers with the Thune-aligned super PAC Senate Leadership Fund, and other former Trump campaign staffers. A source with knowledge of the meeting said the group agreed that Cornyn and allies need to focus over the summer on improving the incumbent\u2019s poll numbers. Thune told NBC News that the meeting \u201ccovered a whole range of races around the country\u201d but declined to go into detail.",
      "Paxton\u2019s team has also been in touch with the White House political team and sharing polling data, according to a source close to his campaign.",
      "In public surveys, the University of Texas at Tyler found Paxton leading Cornyn by 10 percentage points, 44%-34%, while Texas Southern University found Paxton leading by nine, 43%-34%. Both polls found about a quarter of voters undecided. Other private polls by outside groups with skin in the game have shown Paxton with an even larger lead.",
      "This is far from the first time Cornyn, a 40-year veteran of elected politics in the state, has faced issues on his right flank. His most recent challenge came in 2014, when he won 59% of the GOP primary vote.",
      "But it may be the most dangerous moment of his Senate career. Cornyn finds himself not only in a national party remade by Trump but in the middle of a civil war in his state between the establishment and the conservative forces that fueled the rise of Sen. Ted Cruz and other tea party Republicans, led to turmoil in the state Legislature and contributed to the impeachment push against and subsequent acquittal of Paxton.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the day and age of: The Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party. And Paxton has done a very good job of being very out-front, being very vocal, being a strong defender of Trump, which voters \u2014 that\u2019s the lens that they look through and evaluate candidates by,\u201d said Matt Langston, a Republican strategist in the state who is not involved in the race.",
      "Primary picks up",
      "Paxton was quick to question Cornyn\u2019s Trump connections and his conservative chops when he launched his primary campaign.",
      "In 2023, Cornyn responded to allegations that Trump had mishandled classified documents by telling a local news reporter that \u201che\u2019s created a circumstance for himself which is, I think, very serious.\u201d That same year, Cornyn responded to the civil verdict finding Trump liable for sexual abuse by saying, \u201cI do not think he could win the presidency\u201d because \u201celectability is \u2026 the sole criterion.\u201d",
      "Cornyn\u2019s opponents have also criticized his past votes on some gun control and immigration bills.",
      "It\u2019s why Cornyn has spent the months portraying himself as a staunch supporter of Trump. In March, he posted a photo of him reading Trump\u2019s book on social media. His pinned image on X is a photo of him with Trump. And his campaign regularly touts his record of voting for Trump\u2019s priorities in the Senate. Cornyn co-chaired a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month delving into questions about Joe Biden\u2019s fitness as president.",
      "\u201cI think we need to remind people of my support for President Trump and his agenda, which is about a 99.2% voting record with his first term and now in his second term,\u201d Cornyn told NBC News, referring to a memo from his Senate office that detailed more than 600 of Cornyn\u2019s votes since 2017. That memo also touted Cornyn\u2019s work to support Trump\u2019s Supreme Court and other judicial nominees, the 2017 tax cuts and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.",
      "On Wednesday, a pro-Cornyn super PAC, Texans for a Conservative Majority, launched a television ad campaign across the state, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.",
      "\u201cMeet the man who votes with President Trump over 99% of the time,\u201d a narrator says in the group\u2019s first TV ad, which also features footage of Trump praising Cornyn at a rally.",
      "Chris LaCivita, a former top Trump campaign official, is working with the super PAC as its senior adviser, according to three people familiar with Cornyn\u2019s campaign. Tony Fabrizio, a top Trump pollster, is working directly with Cornyn\u2019s campaign.",
      "Paxton\u2019s vulnerabilities",
      "While Paxton has been trying to lob bombs at Cornyn from his right flank, Cornyn and his team are ready to exploit the attorney general\u2019s multiple controversies.",
      "\u201cThe baggage that my opponent would bring into the election would make it likely that we would lose that seat to a Democrat if he were the nominee. So I\u2019m not going to let that happen,\u201d Cornyn said.",
      "Paxton was indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015 and eventually reached a deal to avoid a trial. But related allegations \u2014 plus accusations including bribery and misuse of his office \u2014 led the GOP-controlled state House to impeach him in 2023, though the state Senate acquitted him.",
      "Prosecuting Paxton on ethical grounds will be a centerpiece of Cornyn\u2019s campaign. He blasted Paxton\u2019s bid as a \u201ccon man\u2019s vanity project\u201d and launched a \u201cCrooked Ken\u201d website detailing the impeachment and allegations of adultery that stemmed from that investigation.",
      "Paxton\u2019s pending divorce from wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, brought those allegations back into the spotlight. Angela Paxton posted on X last week that she had \u201cfiled for divorce on biblical grounds \u2026 in light of recent discoveries.\u201d",
      "The day of Paxton\u2019s divorce announcement was his campaign\u2019s second-largest small-dollar fundraising day since his launch, according to a person close to the Paxton campaign.",
      "Paxton\u2019s allies see those controversies as fueling his reputation as a fighter among grassroots Republicans.",
      "\u201cKen has a strong 40, 45% of MAGA voters that won\u2019t leave him,\u201d said Paxton adviser Nick Maddux. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen him fight, they\u2019ve seen him in the trials and they like what he\u2019s done. And Cornyn\u2019s never done that. He doesn\u2019t have a hard base of support.\u201d",
      "Paxton\u2019s campaign also raised $2.9 million from April through June, ending the quarter with $2.5 million in its campaign account. Cornyn\u2019s campaign raised $804,000 and ended the quarter with $5.9 million on hand, while his joint fundraising committee raised $3.1 million and had $2.7 million on hand.",
      "The Cornyn campaign\u2019s haul marked its second-worst quarter over the senator\u2019s past two election cycles on the ballot (2020 and 2014). But the campaign dismissed any concerns about his fundraising.",
      "\u201cSenator Cornyn is a very strong fundraiser, always has been and will continue to be,\u201d said Cornyn campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiack, who said focusing on the joint fundraising committee was a \u201cstrategic\u201d move to be able to access lower television ad rates.",
      "A growing field?",
      "While Cornyn and Paxton battle, it is possible the primary field could grow.",
      "U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt told NBC News late last month he still hasn\u2019t made a decision about whether to run for Senate, but the two-term Republican notes he hasn\u2019t seen a poll showing Cornyn can beat Paxton in a primary.",
      "Asked if that\u2019s a concern in Texas, he told NBC News: \u201cIt should be.\u201d",
      "Hunt\u2019s House campaign committee recently launched a cable ad buy that reaches beyond his Houston-area district, into the Dallas and San Antonio media markets, according AdImpact. Hunt also shared a minute-long spot that features Trump praising him, and a pro-Hunt outside group, Standing for Texas, has also spent more than $2 million so far on ads boosting him around the state.",
      "GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson also told NBC News this week that he has not ruled out running for Senate and he is going to \u201ckeep my powder dry right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people think Ken Paxton might have trouble in the general,\u201d Jackson said, noting there are concerns among Republicans that a competitive Texas race would pull resources from other battleground states.",
      "That concern is partly why Senate Republican leaders, including Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott, are backing Cornyn.",
      "\u201cWe need an electable candidate that can win not just a primary, but a general, and we believe there\u2019s a path there for Cornyn to win both,\u201d Thune recently told NBC News.",
      "Democrats have long sought to turn Texas blue, but they have not been able to build on a narrow loss to Cruz in 2018. Trump won Texas by 8 percentage points last year, while Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by nearly 9 points. Allred recently launched another run for Senate.",
      "Langston, the GOP strategist, didn\u2019t buy the argument that Paxton would put the seat at risk if he is the nominee, given the state\u2019s red hue.",
      "\u201cYou would have to have almost 100% of registered Democrats coming out to vote, plus a good 10 or 12% of Republicans crossing over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just never going to happen.\u201d"

      "During a federal trial challenging the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport pro-Palestinian activists, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Tuesday testified that the orders to target Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk were so unconventional that he had to seek confirmation on the legality of the arrest.",
      "Patrick Cunningham, the agent who oversaw the arrest of \u00d6zt\u00fcrk in March, told the court in Boston that he had consulted a Department of Homeland Security attorney to check that arresting her based on her visa being revoked was legal. Cunningham also said he had no knowledge of any criminal offense she had committed.",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk, who was in ICE custody for two months, was released in May.",
      "\u201cWhen you receive information from headquarters at this level, top down, you make the assumption that it\u2019s legally sufficient,\u201d Cunningham, who is part of ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations arm in Boston, told the court. \u201cBut I did contact our legal counsel to ensure that we\u2019re on solid legal ground.\u201d",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s attorney Mahsa Khanbabai said in an email to NBC News that the arrest has \u201cnever been about immigration enforcement.",
      "Rather, it \u201chas always been about retaliation and punishment on protected speech,\u201d Khanbabai said. \u201cWe are confident the courts will continue to uphold the basic principles of a just and free society.\u201d",
      "Cunningham\u2019s testimony is part of the second week of a trial in which five scholar groups, including the Harvard University faculty chapter of the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association, are alleging that the detentions of  \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and others and attempted deportations violated the First Amendment. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was grabbed by agents off a Massachusetts street in late March, with the DHS accusing her of engaging \u201cin activities in support of Hamas.\u201d",
      "The doctoral student co-wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper last year that called on Tufts to \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide\u201d and divest from companies with ties to Israel. The university has said the essay did not violate its policies.",
      "Cunningham was among four Homeland Security agents to testify in the case that day. He told the court that his role involved sharing information that HSI knew about \u00d6zt\u00fcrk to \u201ceffectively put agents on the street and try and locate her.\u201d He also said that he had read the op-ed \u00d6zt\u00fcrk had written prior to the arrest.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything in the op-ed suggesting she committed a crime,\u201d Cunningham said.",
      "Cunningham, whose career largely dealt with drug enforcement and investigations into money laundering, said that he had little to no previous experience with arrests based on visa revocations. But after Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, the agency held several meetings about these types of arrests and how they now would be a priority. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s arrest was based on orders that came from DHS headquarters, he said.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t recall a time that it\u2019s come top down like this with a visa revocation\u2014 under my purview anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the superiors that were inquiring about this, it made it a priority, because we work for them.\u201d",
      "\u00d6zt\u00fcrk was moved to three locations after her arrest before she ended up in an ICE facility in rural Louisiana. Judge William K. Sessions III in Massachusetts ordered her release in May.",
      "\u201cI am not going to put a travel restriction on her, because, frankly, I don\u2019t find that she poses any risk of flight,\u201d Sessions said.",
      "The trial is expected to conclude this week, with closing arguments slated for Friday. Earlier in the proceedings, Peter Hatch, a senior DHS investigations official, revealed in a bombshell testimony that the names of most of the student protesters who were flagged to the agency for analysis came from the anonymous group Canary Mission. The controversial organization publishes a detailed database of students, professors and others who it says have shared anti-Israel and antisemitic viewpoints. For years, the group has drawn allegations of doxxing and harassment,",
      "\u201cI can say that Canary Mission is not part of the U.S. government. It is not information that we would take as an authoritative source, and we do not work with the individuals who create the website,\u201d Hatch told the court. \u201cI don\u2019t know who creates the website. We don\u2019t have a relationship with the creators of the website.\u201d"

      "The State Department\u2019s move to limit Nigerian travelers to three-month, single-entry visas last week has Nigerian Americans and immigrant communities scrambling to navigate the sudden shift in travel policy and its rippling effects.",
      "The tighter restrictions apply only to nonimmigrant and nondiplomatic travelers, who were previously allowed multiple entries to the U.S., for five years in most cases, per visa application.",
      "Olatunde Johnson, a 27-year-old photographer, said that his aunts and uncles in Nigeria run multiple Airbnb rentals in Chicago that will now be tougher for them to monitor, and that he feels unable to help because he lives in New Jersey.",
      "\u201cThey will have to keep reapplying and doing that again. Also, you\u2019re losing money in the process of that. So it\u2019s just unnecessary,\u201d he said.",
      "The State Department justified the decision, saying it was aimed at reaching \u201cvisa reciprocity\u201d between the U.S. and Nigeria. However, the Nigerian government denied that there is an imbalance and said its relationship with the U.S. has been reciprocal and still is.",
      "\u201cContrary to misinformation and fake news circulating online, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has never stopped issuing 5-year multiple-entry visas for US citizens, in accordance with the principle of subsisting bilateral agreements and reciprocity,\u201d the government said in a statement.",
      "The State Department did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "Rep. Jonathan Jackson, a Democrat from Illinois who represents part of Chicago and who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, touted the city\u2019s \u201cstrong and dynamic Nigerian diaspora.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany have deep roots here and equally deep ties to Nigeria \u2014 family, businesses and investments,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhen we make it harder for them to travel back and forth, to manage their affairs, or even just to visit loved ones, we are not just impacting individuals, we are weakening the very bonds that enrich both our nations.\u201d",
      "The State Department\u2019s move is part of a multipronged effort under the Trump administration to crack down on immigration to the United States in general. This includes a full ban on travelers from 12 countries and a partial ban on seven others. Nigerians are not banned from entering the U.S., but the restrictions apply mostly to travelers from countries in Africa and the Middle East.",
      "Johnson said he thinks the visa decision by the Trump administration is \u201cspreading out a whole lot of stress and unnecessary pain.\u201d He said getting a visa to the U.S. had already been difficult for Africans, and the administration is making entry requirements even more strict.",
      "As a region, African countries had the highest rate of F-1 student visa denials in the world from 2015 to 2022, according to a study released last year by Shorelight and the President\u2019s Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, both nonprofits that support international students on U.S. campuses. Last year, 46.5% of Nigerian applicants for temporary business visas were denied, according to State Department records.",
      "Bobby Digi Olisa, 51, who lives in New York, said the new restrictions will affect how often he sees his siblings, who aren\u2019t U.S. citizens and live in Nigeria. He is particularly concerned about his siblings\u2019 ability to afford multiple visa applications each year to visit the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt will cause hardship with all of the ballooning costs,\u201d he said.",
      "Currently visa applicants must pay a $185 fee to enter the U.S. for tourist, business, student and exchange visas, among others. Starting Oct. 1, there will be an additional $250 Visa Integrity Fee, which will increase with inflation, per the Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
      "Ovigwe Eguegu, a policy analyst at Development Reimagined, an international consulting firm with a focus on Africa, said complaints over family reunification from Olisa and others will not put enough pressure on the U.S. government for it to reverse course, but he thinks it will affect how the Nigerian government responds.",
      "Eguegu said families like Olatunde Johnson\u2019s will be affected due to their long-term ties to the U.S., which require about five entries throughout the year for business. However, he cautions, \u201cwait time for visa processing is very, very long, and it costs a serious amount of money, too. So the preference has always been for multiple re-entry over a long period of time, as opposed to single entry capped at three months of a maximum stage.\u201d",
      "Jackson said the restrictions, more broadly, weakened people-to-people ties and undermined effective diplomacy.",
      "\u201cMy travels have taught me that true diplomacy and strong international relations are built on understanding, trust and facilitating human connection,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe must find a way to address any legitimate security concerns without undermining the critical economic and cultural bridges that link communities like Chicago with Nigeria.\u201d",
      "Johnson\u2019s frustration is being echoed throughout the world toward the Trump administration. \u201cWe the people, wherever you are, we\u2019re always the ones losing when the government is playing games,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "But despite the \u201cpain\u201d inflicted on Nigerians, Olisa stressed: \u201cThis too shall pass, we shall overcome.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Whether it\u2019s sunscreens, sheet masks or serums, Korean beauty has a firm grip on the skin care scene (and for good reason). But one element of K-beauty you may not be as familiar with are ampoules, which are small, highly concentrated doses of skin care ingredients. So, what exactly are ampoules and, most importantly, do you need to be using them?",
      "To answer these questions and more, I spoke to Dr. Jane Yoo, a dual board-certified dermatologist, Mohs surgeon and a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, about everything you need to know, including the best products and tips for choosing ampoules of your own.",

      "What is an ampoule?",
      "Ampoules have high doses of active ingredients to address specific skin care concerns, including redness, dryness, textured skin and fine lines, says Yoo. Traditionally, ampoules refer to small, sealed vials that contain skin care treatments and even medications within the medical industry, but nowadays it\u2019s much more common for ampoules to come in bottles with squeezable dropper tops, she says.",
      "The formulas usually center on one active ingredient like vitamin C, propolis or retinol, or hydrating ingredients like polynucleotides and polydeoxyribonucleotides. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re described as supercharged serums as they contain higher concentrations of actives than standard serums, and are intended for short-term, targeted use,\u201d says Yoo.",
      "How I picked the best ampoules",
      "When rounding up the best ampoules to shop, I considered options across a range of active ingredients to make sure that, no matter what concern you\u2019re looking to address, you can find a potential answer on this list. Here\u2019s more on how I chose the ampoules below:",
      "Ingredients: Since ampoules usually focus on a specific active, I chose options that center a single ingredient. Although they may have other ingredients (especially to help balance or hydrate the skin), each ampoule has a star ingredient that\u2019s most potent.Skin concerns: I was careful to pick ampoules that cover a range of skin care issues, including redness, excessive oil, dryness and fine lines.",

The ampoule\u2019s main ingredient, pine tree leaf extract, has anti-inflammatory properties that help calm irritated skin, according to the brand. It also has plant-based peptides to help produce more collagen, which improves the skin\u2019s elasticity and firmness. Altogether, this results in firmer, smoother skin with less breakouts and sensitivity.",
      "I brought this ampoule along with me on a trip to Brazil, and it helped soothe my skin after long days in the harsh sun. It also prevented my skin from getting overly dry or spawning any new pimples, which is usually what happens to me after spending hours swimming in the salty waters of the beach.",

      "How to shop for ampoules",
      "Below are Yoo\u2019s tips for what to consider when shopping for ampoules, including formula type, skin care concerns and how to apply them.",
      "Yoo suggests keeping an eye out for a strong concentration of a main ingredient. While the concentrations differ between products, some can go as high as 50% for a single ingredient, which usually yields quick results if you use them properly, says Yoo. They should also have simple formulas that have a short ingredient list and minimal additives, like colorants, preservatives or fragrance, to help prevent irritation.",
      "As with any skin care treatment, your purchase should be tailored to addressing your specific skin issues, like breakouts, dullness and dryness. If you have sensitive skin and are looking to try ampoules with stronger ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or retinol, choose a formula that has calming ingredients like ceramides or centella to help offset any irritation, says Yoo.",
      "Here are some ingredients to consider based on skin concerns and skin type:",
      "Sensitive, irritated skin: Look for soothing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile and centella asiatica.Dry, dehydrated skin: Look for hydrators like ceramides, glycerin or hyaluronic acid.Dull skin or skin with hyperpigmentation: Consider brightening actives like niacinamide, vitamin C and plant extracts.Mature skin with fine lines: Consider firming ingredients like retinol and peptides.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Ampoules are like a booster shot for your skin, so you should use them during periods of skin stress or flare-ups, says Yoo. \u201cIt\u2019s a booster step in your routine, not an everyday essential,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be helpful when your regular products aren\u2019t doing enough and you need something more intensive.\u201d She recommends cycling them into your routine after cleansing and before moisturizing, especially at night. However, while some ampoules are gentle enough to use daily, many are also strong formulas that are meant for short-term use, so be sure to check the label for best usage instructions, says Yoo.",
      "The difference between ampoules and serums are in their concentration, and which you should use depends on your skin goals, according to Yoo. Ampoules have a higher concentration of actives and often focus on one key ingredient, while serums are better for daily maintenance and usually combine multiple ingredients.",
      "\u201cAmpoules are more like short-term treatments,\u201d she says. Ampoules also tend to work faster than serums, but Yoo warns they can be more intense for sensitive skin.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Most Prime Day deals last through the duration of the sale (it ends tonight, Jul. 11), but some are limited-time offers. For example, Lightning Deals are typically a few hours long \u2014 once a product sells out, the deal is over. Amazon is adding new deals each day of the sale, so make sure you\u2019re constantly browsing. It\u2019s also important to check out as soon as you see something you want since prices can go up any time.",
      "For the first time ever this year, Amazon Prime Day is four days long. It\u2019s typically a 48-hour event, so you have double the amount of time to shop this year.",
      "Prime Day 2025 ends tonight, Friday, Jul. 11 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time (2:59 a.m. ET on Saturday, Jul. 12).",
      "Amazon has not announced when the next Prime Day is. For the past few years, the retailer hosted its Prime Big Deal Days in October, which is nearly identical to July\u2019s sale with slightly different products on sale to focus more on the holiday shopping season.",
      "How I found the best Prime Day deals",
      "All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select\u2019s previous coverage and reporting. I also included products the NBC Select staff tested, including Wellness Award and Giftable Tech Award winners. I ran each deal through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to ensure products are at their lowest price in at least three months. All the products I recommend are 20% off or more, and highly rated with at least a 4.0-star average rating from hundreds of reviews.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m a reporter for NBC Select who has covered Amazon Prime Day since 2020. In addition to writing about the best deals, I also wrote about what\u2019s included in a Prime membership, the history of Prime Day and what to buy and skip this year. Prior to Amazon\u2019s flagship sale, I previewed a list of deals from the retailer and sorted through them to find worthwhile sales you should know about.",

    "story": [
      "In March 1998, 23-year-old Amy Lynn Bradley boarded the Rhapsody of the Seas with her parents and younger brother for a Caribbean cruise. Just a day and a half into the trip, she vanished.",
      "The ship was approaching Cura\u00e7ao, and Amy Bradley had been out late with her brother at the ship\u2019s nightclub, according to the FBI. By early morning, she was gone.",
      "The case drew national attention at the time and has continued to surface in internet forums, true crime podcasts and TV specials in the decades since. But Amy Bradley\u2019s disappearance has never been solved. No body was found. No charges were filed. And no official explanation has ever been confirmed.",
      "Now, 26 years later, a new Netflix docuseries, \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing,\u201d looks back at her disappearance. Directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, the three-part series revisits key witness accounts and theories \u2014 from possible overboard scenarios to organized trafficking \u2014 while focusing on the family\u2019s decades-long search for answers.",
      "\u201cThe story has so many layers,\u201d Mark tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd when you sit with this family in their home and hear what they\u2019ve been through, you understand why this is a story that deserves to be told.\u201d",
      "A long-unsolved case",
      "Amy Bradley disappeared in the early morning hours of March 24, 1998, as the ship neared the island of Cura\u00e7ao.",
      "She was last seen asleep on her chair on the balcony of the ship\u2019s eighth deck at 4:30 a.m, according to the Curacao police, as reported by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 1998.",
      "At the time, Netherlands Antilles Coast Guard Lt. Sjoerd Soethout said, to reporters, she may have fallen from the balcony.",
      "The FBI at the time searched the ship in St. Maarten, its next destination, and an FBI spokeswoman said the agency had \u201cno evidence of foul play,\u201d the AP reported at the time.",
      "The FBI is still offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to Bradley\u2019s recovery.",
      "The family\u2019s theories",
      "In the years since, dozens of explanations have circulated \u2014 including a theory she was kidnapped and speculation that she fell or jumped overboard.",
      "Her family has long believed she was taken against her will and may still be alive, which her parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, and brother Brad Bradley reiterate in the documentary.",
      "The docuseries does not offer a definitive conclusion. Instead, it builds a detailed timeline and walks viewers through how the investigation unfolded and where it hit dead ends. Throughout, the series places the Bradleys at the center of the story, offering a portrait of a family still living with questions. The docuseries also features interviews with people who believe they saw Amy Bradley at various locations in the Caribbean.",
      "\u201cThe thing that keeps them going, and kept us going, is that their hope is completely inextinguishable,\u201d Mark says. \u201cAmy is present for them every single second of every single day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery single day wasn\u2019t just another day of production, every single day was another day that Amy could be home,\u201d Lott adds.",
      "Ron and Iva Bradley filed two lawsuits on the same day against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in Miami-Dade court. Both were dismissed in 1999.",
      "Telling a story without a conclusion",
      "With no definitive conclusion to Amy Bradley\u2019s case, the filmmakers behind \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing\u201d faced a challenge: how do you tell a complete story when the central mystery remains unsolved?",
      "\u201cWe really tried not to present anything to viewers that we didn\u2019t ourselves think was real or credible,\u201d Mark says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fact checking, a lot of information gathering and research that goes into these things so if certain leads had no substance we didn\u2019t put them in the show.\u201d",
      "That approach guided how they structured the series. The episodes aren\u2019t just a string of rumors \u2014 they follow a clear timeline, anchored by evidence, official reports and direct interviews. Each theory introduced in the series, whether involving foul play, accidental death, or human trafficking, is rooted in credible information, but never framed as the definitive truth.",
      "The result is a docuseries that resists sensationalism. Instead of promising answers, it leans into uncertainty, inviting viewers to sit with the discomfort that the Bradleys have lived with for more than two decades.",
      "\u201cYou go into a project like this thinking maybe you\u2019ll land somewhere. And instead, every time we thought we had a theory nailed down, something else would unravel it,\u201d Lott says. \u201cWe\u2019d find ourselves saying, \u2018OK, it\u2019s definitely this.\u2019 And then by the next day, \u2018Actually, no. It might be something else entirely.\u2019\u201d",
      "While they won\u2019t reveal which theory they personally believe, they agree that something shifted early that morning on the ship. \u201cSomething happened that cannot be explained at about 5:45 a.m. on that ship,\u201d Lott says. \u201cThat started the timeline that is not easy to answer.\u201d",
      "Mark adds that the ambiguity has never meant indifference. \u201cWe know there\u2019s more to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so cut and dry.\u201d",
      "By Episode 3, the show has made its position clear: the point isn\u2019t to provide closure, because closure may never come. Instead, it\u2019s about creating clarity around the facts, while honoring the ambiguity that still defines Amy Bradley\u2019s case.",
      "What Amy Bradley\u2019s family is doing now",
      "The final episode of \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing\u201d doesn\u2019t offer resolution. Instead, it offers an invitation \u2014 to re-engage with a case that, after 26 years, still holds unanswered questions for her family.",
      "For the filmmakers, this isn\u2019t just a story about one family\u2019s grief. It\u2019s also a story about how collective attention, even decades later, might still help uncover the truth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always excited about getting shows out for the public,\u201d Lott tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful conclusion to a process, but when you meet this family and you hear how present and alive Amy is for them every single second of every single day, the responsibility for getting a show onto the air is about life and death.\u201d",
      "Amy\u2019s family continues to hold out hope. In the closing moments of the series, her mother, Iva Bradley, says they wake up every day thinking \u201cmaybe today,\u201d and go to bed each night thinking \u201cmaybe tomorrow.\u201d",
      "That hope, unshaken after more than two decades, is what the filmmakers say anchored the entire project.",
      "Between moments of uncertainty and unresolved leads, the series returns again and again to the person at the center: a daughter, a sister, a friend. \u201cThis show, more than others, feels communal,\u201d Mark says. \u201cIf we can engage enough people around the world\u2014people who want to do something, people who want to help\u2014we think there\u2019s a real chance something new could come to light.\u201d",
      "For the Bradleys, that possibility is everything. Even now, they believe someone, somewhere, knows something. And they\u2019re still waiting for the right person to speak up."

      "During the challenge, islanders left anonymous notes to each other. One Amaya received said that she cried too much and moved too fast in relationships. As she started to tear up, she was quick to defend herself: \u201cPeople can express themselves the way that I can express myself, so I\u2019m tired of people viewing that as a negative instead of a power move.\u201d",

From there, they spent a night in the private Hideaway, tag-teamed parenting a baby doll, met each other\u2019s families and eventually, on their first and final date in Fiji, went exclusive.",

      "Bryan: I think just right from our conversations, they flowed so nice, and just especially on the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge, I\u2019ve instantly seen how misunderstood she was, and I can relate. I felt like I grew up misunderstood in the outside world, and that definitely caught my attention. And once we started talking, I feel like we understood each other right away.",
      "Amaya: I definitely would have to say that my parents played a huge part in that. My father always told me that a strong, confident woman would always intimidate or scare the cowards.",
      "So I knew that it was just more of, like, projection on a lot of people\u2019s part. And instead of just viewing sadness as a weakness, it\u2019s a strength, and we are all blessed to have these emotions. And your girl\u2019s an emotional girl, a sensitive gangster.",
      "Amaya: To be honest, how well she defended herself. That was great to see. But I also saw three people kind of giving her a bad rep for stuff that I see are pearls, because I definitely want a woman that has those things, so I felt like I needed to speak up. They they said something about her calling people \u201cmi amor\u201d and \u201cbabe\u201d and stuff like that, and that\u2019s just how Hispanic people talk. I just felt like them saying something, I had to stand up and say something.",
      "Amaya: Oh, my God, I\u2019ve been telling Bryan all day, literally, I am my own best friend. I love to talk to myself, and that\u2019s just me just having that good relationship within yourself.",
      "And I would have to say that the power of the tongue is very powerful. And that\u2019s me doing positive affirmations. So there\u2019s a really huge, positive impact on doing that. You should be your own best friend no matter what.",
      "Amaya: I would definitely say: I\u2019m a butterfly that likes to be in the sky no matter if there\u2019s rain.",
      "Bryan: I love it.",
      "Amaya: Hi, Boston! They\u2019re definitely going to be seeing me, because I have to visit my boo. I\u2019m waiting for that truffle pasta.",
      "Bryan: Right when we got our phones back, we were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to call family.\u201d",
      "Amaya: It feels very surreal. But to see the love and to see our supporters, our extended family, it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to just feel validated and reassured.",
      "Bryan: You\u2019ve got to be grateful for it all. Obviously there\u2019s ups and downs, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got each other, support each other, get through everything together.",
      "Amaya: To be honest, I let my intrusive thoughts win all the time. Like I really don\u2019t think before I speak. That\u2019s my creativity skill. Like, I\u2019m not the best drawer, but I could definitely just say things.",
      "Bryan: Her creativity is something different.",
      "Amaya: I definitely would say to be your own best friend, and that you should just always talk positivity into your life.",
      "You came into the world by yourself, you\u2019re leaving the world with yourself, so just literally enjoying your own presence.",
      "Amaya: (Laughs) I literally was always on good energy, high energy. I jog back home, so I wasn\u2019t able to jog in the villa besides my zoomies. So at least I was getting my steps in while doing that, right?",
      "Amaya: No. Amaya Papaya, that really started in the villa. Like one person just said it, and it became a waterfall. Everybody started saying it. And I\u2019m like, you know what? I like papayas, anyway, so why not?",
      "I ate a papaya a couple of days ago, and I was like, I usually don\u2019t eat my kids. I swear.",
      "Amaya: I call him Bry Bry.",
      "Bryan: I call her mi amor.",
      "Amaya: Something definitely (by) Bad Bunny.",
      "Bryan: Yeah, it\u2019s a Bad Bunny song, for sure. The culture.",
      "Bryan: I was thinking on how I can end it, and what better way to end it than a quote from the legend, right?",
      "Bryan: We started on camera, and we\u2019ll probably keep showing stuff, but obviously we want to protect us as well, so we\u2019re definitely going to keep some stuff private.",
      "Like she said, we just got our phones back, and we want to check on family and really spend time with each other without a mic or a camera in front of us. We\u2019re getting back to everybody and getting back to all the supporters that we\u2019re super grateful for. Just enjoying our time right now.",

    "story": [
      "Packing for labor is rarely glamorous \u2014 unless you\u2019re Olivia Culpo. The model and influencer\u2019s hospital bag video is going viral for being both luxe and (possibly) practical.",
      "Culpo, 33, who announced the birth of her daughter with NFL player Christian McCaffrey earlier this week, has sparked conversation with a TikTok showing exactly what she packed for the hospital. Since being posted on July 10, the video has received more than 1.9 million views and nearly 4,000 comments.",
      "\u201cI worked really hard on this, and I know how overwhelming the whole process is,\u201d Culpo says at the start of the clip. \u201cI committed a while ago to making a video. I\u2019ve watched so many of these and they\u2019re really interesting.\u201d",
      "It quickly becomes clear Culpo isn\u2019t a throw-it-in-a-duffel-and-go kind of packer.",
      "\u201cEverything in this first suitcase is, like, my comfort stuff,\u201d she explains. \u201cTwo fluffy comforters, twin size for Christian and I ... Two sleep masks. I have one mini fan. I actually got another one.\u201d",
      "She continues, sharing that she also intends to pack items for aromatherapy, a plushy robe from Chasa and a photo of her dog. Culpo topped off her list of comfortable items with what she describes as the \"most ridiculous\" thing she's packed: a set of flameless flickering candles.",
      "When it comes to outfits, Culpo has those covered, too \u2014 from a matching lounge robe set and \u201call of my favorite pajama sets\u201d to an \u201call-cashmere black outfit,\u201d nursing bras, and products for foot swelling.",
      "Culpo ends the video with a dose of self-awareness: \u201cI hope you guys find it useful, but if you didn\u2019t find any of this helpful and you think I\u2019m ridiculous... then I slightly agree with you.\u201d",
      "While some viewers were surprised by the sheer volume of what she packed, others defended her approach.",
      "\"As a labor nurse...literally bring whatever you want,\" wrote one viewer. \"Comfort is important, especially if you have a C-section and a longer hospital stay.\"",
      "When one user questioned Culpo's decision to include so many white bedding a clothing items, she replied, \u201cIf you\u2019re bleeding enough after a C-section to soak THROUGH your pads/diaper/bandages and onto your bedding, that\u2019s a serious medical issue, not a packing fail,\u201d she wrote.",
      "\u201cAlso\u2026 the hospital sheets are already white. Are you going to ask them if they have other colors for you lol.\u201d",
      "In large part, her inclusion of the candles had people debating.",
      "\"The flickering candles made me literally LOL,\" one commented, while another said, \"Everyone hating on the flickering candles hasn't given birth LOL having mine made my room so much more peaceful!\"",
      "\"I am SOOOOOO happy I had these,\" Culpo replied. \"They come with a remote control.. I had a c section so I couldn\u2019t get up to turn on or off the lights (which are horrible and fluorescent anyway) .. I wanted to be able to see the baby at night etc. No one will ever convince me these were a bad idea I\u2019m sorry.\"",
      "In the end, most users just wanted to know what actually worked for the model at the end of the day.",
      "\u201cOmg are you kidding,\u201d one person commented. \u201cThat is so much \u2014 you have to do another video and tell us what you actually used lol."

      "\"My love, I was so wrong. Dying is the opposite of leaving. When I left my body, I did not go away,\" Gibson's poem begins. \"That portal of light was not a portal to elsewhere, but a portal to here. I am more here than I ever was before. I am more with you than I ever could have imagined. So close you look past me when wondering where I am.\"",
      "Filmed outdoors, the clip shows Gibson and Falley sitting in the grass as the poet reads.",
      "\"Why did no one tell us that to die is to be reincarnated in those we love while they are still alive? Ask me the altitude of heaven, and I will answer, 'How tall are you?'\"",
      "Views of Gibson's reading have increased in the aftermath of their death, as longtime followers of their work and those newly discovering it share it across platforms. The clip from the interview has already garnered over 22,000 views on YouTube since it was posted July 14.",
      "Along with thoughts of awe at Gibson's ability to write a poem about love that endures as they faced their own mortality, many expressed gratitude to the poet for simply crafting such vulnerable words",
      "\"I see the news that someone I never met in person has died, and it knocks the breath out of me and leaves me weeping,\" a commenter on YouTube replied to a post of the reading. \"Your light, your depth, your words have touched my soul. Your poetry has been the portal to a connection to you that makes our never having met in person meaningless. I love you, Andrea. Thank you for everything.\"",
      "\"Weeping,\" another read. \"I\u2019m weeping for love, for their love, for the beauty and truth that transcends death.\"",
      "\"Andrea Andrea Andrea forever with us, forever inspiring us,\" added one more. \"I lost my grandmother this spring, and I came to this conclusion too from the help of art and stories like this one. Sending so much love to Andrea\u2019s loved ones that will surely be grieving for quite some time. But having this love letter is more than enough to remember the truth. Those who die never leave us.\"",
      "Gibson's poem \"Love Letter From The Afterlife\" was originally published on their Substack on Dec. 21, 2023."

      "For the episode, Chrisley was joined by her friend and plastic surgeon, Dr. Charlie Galanis, who performed the medical procedure.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just be honest here, because that\u2019s what my life is these days. I\u2019m just honest about everything. The way that Charlie and I met was through another plastic surgeon, because I was wanting to get some work done. You did my lipo,\u201d she explained at the beginning of the podcast while introducing Galanis.",

      "The reality television star continued, \u201cI was going through all kinds of s\u2014 with my endometriosis, and I had taken this medication, and I gained 40 pounds, literally, in like three months. It was crazy.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor me, it was just, I felt like s---. I didn\u2019t like how I looked. Like, if you don\u2019t like how you look, it doesn\u2019t just take the toll on you physically, but emotionally and mentally,\u201d she shared.",
      "Galanis chimed in to agree and said that for him the plastic surgery business is about how his patients feel when the procedure is completed. He also said that Chrisley initially wanted to \u201ca la carte\u201d other cosmetic procedures before he convinced her otherwise.",
      "Chrisley went on to gush about the results from her liposuction and how they affected her body image in just six weeks.",
      "\u201cWhen you can look in the mirror and see a difference, it, for me, (made) me want to live a healthier life,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I saw the results, I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I want to keep this up!\u2019\u201d",

      "Seemingly unfazed by President Donald Trump's 50-day ultimatum to end the fighting, Russia launched hundreds of drones and missile strikes on six Ukrainian regions overnight, officials in the country said.",
      "A child was among at least two people killed and 25 people were injured in the strikes in northern, central and southern Ukraine, according to a statement on Telegram from the Ukrainian air force and data collated by regional military administrations.",
      "The large-scale, long-range attacks targeted energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X. Power was cut for 80,000 families in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and other locations in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine's largest private energy company DTEK said on the Telegram app.",
      "The attacks came hours after Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart not to target Moscow. It followed a report by the Financial Times citing two people familiar with the conversation that he had encouraged Zelenskyy to step up attacks deep inside Russia.",
      "NBC News has not independently confirmed the Financial Times\u2019 reporting, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that Trump \u201cwas merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has previously lavished praise on Vladimir Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Monday gave the Russian president 50 days to agree to a peace deal. During a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House, he also said that he would slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods.",
      "At the same time, he said, the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d including Patriot air defense missiles, to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said that some of the vaunted missile systems had been shipped to Ukraine. \u201cThey\u2019re coming in from Germany,\u201d he said, adding that NATO members would \u201cpay us back for everything.\u201d",
      "However, the 50-day window has been criticized by some European officials and experts, who have asked why Trump is giving additional time to Putin, who has repeatedly stated his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "And there was no letup in Russian attacks on Ukraine overnight as it bombarded several cities with around 400 drones and an Iskander ballistic missile, Ukraine\u2019s air force said.",
      "\u201cRussia does not change its strategy,\u201d Zelenskyy said Wednesday in a post on Telegram, a day after a strike in his hometown in central Ukraine. \u201cIn order to effectively counteract this terror, we need a systematic strengthening of protection: more aircraft, more interceptors, more determination to make Russia feel our answer.\u201d"

      "Babies receiving critical care in Gaza risk becoming much sicker or even dying in the coming days as the enclave runs out of fuel and hospitals are forced to turn off incubators, doctors warn.",
      "Walking down a row of incubators in the neonatal unit of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, head of the facility's pediatric unit, shared each baby's story one by one.",
      "\"This baby is a full-term baby,\" he told NBC News' crew on the ground Thursday, gesturing at a tiny figure tucked into an incubator, wrapped in only his diaper and with an oxygen tube fixed to his nose with surgical tape.",
      "\"As you can see, he is depending on the mechanical ventilation,\" Al-Farra said. \"If the electricity was cut off ... this baby will not survive.\"",
      "His warning evokes memories of early on in the war, when a number of infants died at hospitals in northern Gaza after repeated warnings that a military assault in the area would end up being fatal for the babies.",
      "Nasser Hospital is just one of several facilities in Gaza facing \"imminent shutdown\" as fuel stocks in the enclave run out, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned Wednesday. The closure of vital units would most likely result in patients' deaths, including in the intensive care and neonatal units, it said.",
      "OCHA added that the \"total ban on fuel entry\" enforced by Israel for around 130 days was to blame for the shortages, which it said has also severely impacted water, sanitation and hygiene services.",
      "While Israel in May lifted a blockade that prevented the entry of food, medical supplies and other vital items, it has only allowed in a limited amount of aid, including \"basic\" food supplies.",
      "\"The real threat to babies in Gaza isn\u2019t a lack of fuel \u2014 it\u2019s Hamas,\"  David Mencer, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in response to a request from NBC News for comment to the warnings of a fuel crisis at hospitals in the enclave.",
      "\"They hijack fuel for terror, not hospitals,\" he said.",
      "Mencer did not answer the question as to whether more fuel would be allowed to reach hospitals in Gaza in the near future.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dr. Mohammad Saqer, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News that the facility only had around 3,000 liters (790 gallons) of diesel left. He said it needed 4,500 liters (1,190 gallons) daily to operate all departments effectively. Already, he said, the hospital had turned off electricity for some departments, funneling power to only the most vital units.",
      "\"The situation is very catastrophic because the electricity will abruptly go off within 24 hours,\" Saqer said. \"This means that a lot of patients, especially in the ICU in addition to other departments, are subject to inevitable death.\"",
      "Hospitals across the enclave have struggled to operate throughout the war, after being hit hard in Israel's offensive. Of the territory's 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 18 are providing partial services and 18 are not working at all, according to World Health Organization data last updated Monday.",
      "Saqer, meanwhile, called on the international community to step in and help get fuel to Gaza's hospitals in order to \"save the lives of the children.\"",
      "His call came as the European Union foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in a post on X on Thursday that E.U. officials had reached a new deal with Israel to allow much-needed food and fuel into the enclave.",

      "Thrown into the water on Newfoundland\u2019s Bell Island, the bottle and its paper cargo traveled on wild Atlantic seas for more than 4,600 days, adrift during 11 iterations of iPhone, two Donald Trump elections and a global pandemic that came and went.",
      "That epic journey took it to the west coast of Ireland, where it was discovered this week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a moment of pure joy,\u201d said Martha Farrell, chair of the Maharees Conservation Association, whose members found the bottle Monday. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s the impossibility and resilience of that glass bottle finding our beach all those years later \u2014 but also the resilience of the couple.\u201d",

      "When Brad Squires, now 40, hurled the bottle off the high cliffs of Bell Island, the couple \"thought it wasn't even going to make it to the water, let alone bypass all the rocks and make it across the ocean and and be found,\" Anita Squires, now 35, told NBC News. \"For all the stars to align, for all those things to happen, it seems like an impossible feat for that little bottle, but it was pretty resilient.\"",
      "Back then, the couple had been dating for a year and were in a long-distance relationship: he a police officer in British Columbia and she a trainee nurse in Newfoundland.",
      "\u201cToday we enjoyed dinner, this bottle of wine and each other on the edge of the island,\u201d she wrote in the message. \u201cIf you find this, please call us,\u201d she added, providing a number but never imagining somebody actually would.",
      "They had shared a precious picnic together on the tiny Bell Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from St. John's. \"I gave it everything I had,\" Brad Squires said of his attempt to launch the bottled missive into the waves below.",
      "They soon forgot about it. They got married in 2016, settling  down in Newfoundland. They have three children, Allie, 19, Gabe, 16, and Harrison, 5.",
      "In Scraggane Bay on Ireland's picturesque Dingle Peninsula, the bottle was found Monday by another couple, Kate and Jon Gay, members of the local charity Maharees Conservation Association, who were doing a beach cleanup.",
      "They kept it until the association's meeting later that night, smashing it open, toasting the unknown writers but failing to get an answer from the number provided. So Farrell posted an appeal on Facebook thinking it might yield an answer in weeks or months. One hour later, Anita Squires had got in touch to say she was the note's author.",
      "\"It was phenomenal,\" Farrell said.",
      "There is a doubly serendipitous side to this story, too.",
      "The Maharees, where the bottle was found, is a 3-mile isthmus of sand that has been battered and eroded by extreme weather and sea-level rises fueled by climate change. So too have parts of Newfoundland.",
      "The grassroots Maharees Conservation Association wants to use this story to link up with people in Newfoundland experiencing the same issues. And the author of the letter in the bottle is going to connect them.",
      "\"They have a soft coastline, they have a sand dune system, and they are also vulnerable to sea level rises,\" Farrell said. \"It's a somber enough affair when you're thinking: How can we actually prepare ourselves for what's to come? So to have this little moment of pure joy in the middle of that, it was very welcome.\"",
      "Anita Squires says that her \"love story is cute, but the work they are doing is so important,\" referring to the conservation group's attempts to protect and adapt their  coastlines to the climate crisis. So, linking these campaigners is \"the beautiful thing at the end of the story.\""

      "In the United States, Lois Lane kisses Superman for a steamy 33 seconds. For those watching the new Superman blockbuster in India, however, when the hero leans in to kiss his paramour, the movie jumps forward abruptly.",
      "That\u2019s because Indian censors have deemed the midair kiss as being \u201coverly sensual.\u201d They have also objected to other parts of the James Gunn blockbuster, shaving 8 seconds off here and there to achieve a 13+ rating, according to local reports and filmgoers.",
      "\u201cThere was an abrupt cut, and it just felt very out of place,\u201d said Kautuk Kundan, 27, who runs an artificial intelligence startup in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru and watched the film over the weekend. \u201cThere were two or three similar cuts in the movie wherein the movie is progressing, and suddenly there\u2019s an abrupt cut, and then it\u2019s the next scene.\u201d",
      "Intervention by authorities has Indian moviegoers fuming, who accuse the censors of making moralistic changes while adopting a double standard for Bollywood films, which are often laced with innuendos, misogyny and sensual scenes.",
      "Indian filmmakers and distributors have long had a strained relationship with India\u2019s censor authority, the Central Board of Film Certification. It\u2019s well expected that if a movie contains any explicit scenes, kisses or profanity, those scenes will be cut. Showing affection is limited to long hugs, with the justification given that India\u2019s population is still mostly conservative and religious, and the scenes could be uncomfortable.",
      "The new Superman film isn\u2019t alone in being hit by censors."

      "President Donald Trump may have expected a Russian shudder of fear after he threatened to impose \u201cvery severe tariffs\u201d if Moscow didn\u2019t agree a ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, his comments appear to have prompted a collective public shrug.",
      "Calling Trump's statements \u201cvery serious,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Russia needs \u201ctime to analyze\u201d them.",
      "But investors in the Russian capital who had been gearing up for tougher measures instead embraced a 50-day grace period on tariffs set by Trump on Monday and the Moscow Stock Exchange was up 2.7% after it opened Tuesday morning.",
      "Oil prices also fell by more than $1 after the announcement, hinting that investors don't think Trump will follow through on his threat to impose the tariffs.",
      "Trump \u201cdid not announce any immediate anti-Russian measures or the confiscation of illegally blocked Russian assets,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, a prominent nationalist politician, said on Telegram on  Tuesday, adding that the president was trying to balance Western support for Kyiv while avoiding a confrontation with the Kremlin.",
      "Trump announced the levies along with the shipment of new weapons to Ukraine during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House on Monday.",
      "His comments came as a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., made its way through Congress. If passed, it would seek to impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",
      "Praising Trump\u2019s announcement, Graham and his bill\u2019s co-sponsor,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that \u201cthe ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin\u2019s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.\u201d",
      "However, Konstantin Kosachev, the deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of the country\u2019s parliament, said Graham\u2019s bill made \u201cno sense.\u201d",
      "In 50 days, \u201chow much can change both on the battlefield and in the mood of those in power both in the U.S. and in NATO?\u201d he added.",
      "And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a hard-liner who frequently issues over-the-top threats, called Trump\u2019s threat a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don\u2019t have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\u201d Trump said, without providing further details.",
      "After the announcement, a White House official said Trump's threat of 100% tariffs was referring to Russian goods, as well as secondary sanctions on other countries that buy its exports.",
      "The president\u2019s comments signal a marked shift in tone over his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long shown admiration. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. We\u2019ve always gotten along well,\u201d Trump said in March.",
      "Many Western countries have cut most of their own financial ties to Moscow since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, its smaller neighbor, triggering the first major land war in Europe since World War II.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about tariffs on countries like India and China that are buying their oil,\u201d Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told reporters Monday after Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cAnd it really is going to, I think, dramatically impact the Russian economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of secondary tariffs are \u201cnever going to go anywhere\u201d as long as he is unwilling to impose costs on Moscow directly, Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told NBC News on Monday.",
      "The tariffs also risk upending delicate China-U.S. trade talks, according to Liu Baocheng at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics.",
      "The \u201cunilateral imposition of punitive trade measures ... risks creating new and unnecessary complications,\u201d Liu said, adding that the 100% secondary tariffs intended to pressure Moscow could instead \u201cseverely backfire by undermining global economic stability and fragmenting international cooperation.\u201d",
      "Most concerning, Liu added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",
      "Trump's tariff agenda has also raised the stakes for India, which has been negotiating a trade deal with Washington to see tariffs on goods from India drop below 20%.",
      "Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told reporters Tuesday that his country had \u201cbeen in touch\u201d with Graham over its concerns and interests on energy and security.",
      "Elsewhere, Europe\u2019s chief negotiator Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters in Brussels on Monday that a 30% tariff on European goods would have a \u201chuge impact on trade.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An elite Chinese cyberspy group hacked at least one state\u2019s National Guard network for nearly a year, the Department of Defense has found.",
      "The hackers, already responsible for one of the most expansive cyberespionage campaigns against the U.S. to date, are alleged to have burrowed even further than previously known, and may have obtained sensitive military or law enforcement information. Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December 2024. The memo did not specify which state was affected.",
      "The report was provided to NBC News through the national security transparency nonprofit Property of the People, which obtained it through a freedom of information request.",
      "The Department of Defense didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A National Guard Bureau spokesperson confirmed the compromise but declined to share details.",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot provide specific details on the attack or our response to it, we can say this attack has not prevented the National Guard from accomplishing assigned state or federal missions, and that NGB continues to investigate the intrusion to determine its full scope,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not deny the campaign but said the U.S. has failed to prove China is behind the Salt Typhoon hacks.",
      "\u201cCyberattacks are a common threat faced by all countries, China included,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. \u201chas been unable to produce conclusive and reliable evidence that the \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 is linked to the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

    "summary": "A study of more than 1 million people found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of autoimmune disease, allergies and autism.",
    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "Coldiretti, an association that represents European agricultural companies, said American consumers would likely face shortages or see price hikes for imported wine, cheese and pastas.",

      "Those statements come after Trump sent a letter to the E.U.

After initially backing down from his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and promising trade deals with dozens of countries, Trump has steadily returned to his trade war posture, sending letters to countries around the world with ultimatums and tariff rates from 20% to 40%.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, a key source of U.S. food and wine exports, said Saturday he strongly disapproved of the 30% tariff and urged the E.U. to speed up \u201cthe preparation of credible countermeasures.\u201d He said trading partners such as the U.S. and Europe \u201cowe each other\u201d respect.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. was the top destination for E.U. exports. The top exported products from the E.U. to the U.S. last year were medical and pharmaceutical products, medicines, motor vehicles and machinery, according to Eurostat.",

      "Ireland is the top source of U.S. pharma imports from the E.U., and serves as the European headquarters of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta.",
      "Speaking in Brussels on Monday after a meeting of E.U. trade ministers, the European Commission\u2019s top trade negotiator, Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said the 30% tariff \u201cis absolutely unacceptable. That is the level which is absolutely prohibitive to any trade.\u201d",
      "Last year, the total value of E.U.-U.S. trade amounted to nearly $2 trillion.",
      "Some are still expressing hope for a deal.",
      "\u201cThe clear impression was that we were very, very close in agreement in principle,\u201d Denmark\u2019s foreign minister said Monday after the trade ministers meeting. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t possible due to this presidential letter, but it is still our major vision that we should reach an agreement, but we also want to send signal that it must be a fair deal for everybody.\u201d",
      "For its part, the E.U. has delayed any countermeasures \u2014 or retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. \u2014 but it currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby.",

      "Trump who shocked reporters and palace pundits in 2018 when he breached royal protocol by walking ahead of the queen, at times blocking her view and giving her his back, said it was a \u201cgreat, great honor\u201d when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hand-delivered the invitation during a visit to the White House in February.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s really something,\u201d he added.",
      "Second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit to the U.K. normally take lunch or tea with the monarch, as was the case with Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Meanwhile, state visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals.",
      "Although the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, which comes with a full display of pageantry and royal pomp, he does so on the advice of the government.",

      "Trump last month lowered tariffs on the British aerospace sector to zero, but imports of British steel products continue to face a 25% duty.",
      "On his last visit to the U.K., Trump injected himself into British politics by endorsing Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister and weighing in on negotiations over Brexit. He also continued his public feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, branding him a loser.",
      "Charles could also face challenges with Trump on Canada, since he's also the head of state for the former British colony. Trump has on several occasions threatened to annex Canada and suggested it should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney criticized the state visit invite in May.",
      "In a speech to the Canadian Parliament in May, Charles highlighted the country's \"sovereignty\" and said it was facing a \"critical moment.\"",

According to the family, a group of settlers blocked an ambulance from reaching Musallet for about three hours.",
      "After the settlers cleared, Musallet\u2019s brother was able to reach him and carry him to the ambulance, according to the statement. However, \u201cSaif died before reaching the hospital.\u201d",
      "A second man, Mohammed al-Shalabi, 23, was also killed in the same incident, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers live in developments built in Palestinian territories that are widely considered illegal by the international community. Since October 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the war in Gaza, violence perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank has surged, often aided or abetted by Israeli security forces.",
      "Settler attacks include raids on villages, arson targeting homes and farmland, and physical assaults on residents that have regularly turned deadly.",
      "It is currently unclear why the confrontation that killed Musallet and al-Shalabi began.",
      "In response to a request for comment from NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said it was \u201caware of reports of the death of a U.S. citizen in the West Bank,\u201d adding the department had no further comment \u201cout of respect for the privacy of the family and loved ones\u201d of the reported victim.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Friday it was \u201caware of reports regarding a Palestinian civilian killed and a number of injured Palestinians as a result of the confrontation, and they are being looked into by the ISA and Israel Police.",
      "Israel Police and Border Police forces were deployed to the scene \"following reports of a physical confrontation between civilians,\" police told NBC News.",
      "\"Several individuals from both sides were detained at the scene on suspicion of involvement in acts of violence,\" it said. \"A joint investigation has since been opened by the Israel Police and the IDF Military Police.\"",
      "Saif\u2019s cousin Fatmah Muhammed told NBC News on Saturday that Musallet worked in an ice cream shop run by his father in Tampa, Florida. He traveled to the West Bank in June to visit his mother, brother and sister.  Musallet\u2019s father was en route to the West Bank from Florida for his funeral, to be held on Sunday.",

      "The town is known for its olive trees and rolling hills, where many modern Palestinian homes are built, including some of the West Bank\u2019s more opulent houses. Families gathered to barbecue and relax, many of them traveling from the U.S. for vacation, but Milbes said growing settler violence has transformed the area.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left over here for people to enjoy, the settlers have taken everything,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cPeople can\u2019t even go there anymore. The settlers have burned the vacation homes, they\u2019ve encroached and put their stuff there.\u201d",

      "Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, said settlers rarely face legal consequences for violence perpetrated against Palestinians. Between 2005 and 2023, more than 93% of all investigations were closed without an indictment and only 3% of investigations led to a conviction, according to a report by the organization.",
      "\u201cThe low conviction rate sends the message that the law enforcement system, in its entirety, does not consider settler violence to be a serious issue, contributing to the perpetrators\u2019 sense of immunity,\u201d the report said.",
      "Since October 2023, 961 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to a database maintained by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a sharp rise from previous years.",
      "CAIR-Florida, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a nationwide Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, condemned Israeli settlers, \u201cbacked and enabled by the Israeli government,\u201d for Musallet\u2019s death, and called on President Donald Trump to \u201cput America first.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis murder is only the latest killing of an American citizen by illegal Israeli settlers or soldiers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEvery other murder of an American citizen has gone unpunished by the American government, which is why the Israeli government keeps wantonly killing American Palestinians and, of course, other Palestinians.\u201d",
      "In April, 14-year-old American Amer Rabee was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. His family said he was picking almonds, the IDF said he was throwing rocks.

      "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened a significant tariff hike on the European Union and Mexico, two of the largest U.S. trade partners.",
      "In separate letters published on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote that each country will face a blanket tariff rate of 30% on all goods exported to the U.S. starting Aug. 1.",
      "Trump threatened even higher tariffs if either the E.U. or Mexico retaliate against his new levy.",
      "Writing to Mexico's president, Trump also focused on border security, saying that \"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough.\"",
      "\"Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,\" he added.",
      "Trump has spent the past week bringing his trade war back to a roaring boil. He kicked it off by issuing dozens of letters announcing unilateral tariffs, then said he planned to impose 50% duties on copper goods, sending prices of the raw metal to all-time highs. Late Thursday, he announced he would apply a blanket tariff of up to 20% on all imports, as well as a 35% tariff on some, and perhaps all, Canadian imports starting next month.",
      "The letters come as the many trade deals that Trump administration officials had said would be signed have failed to materialize, leaving Trump with little to show for weeks of negotiations.",
      "While Mexico was spared from Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff rollout on April 2, the 30% rate for the E.U. is 10 percentage points higher than what the president said he would apply to America's largest trading partner in April but lower than his mid-May threat of 50%.",
      "The 27-member European Union is the United States\u2019 largest trading partner \u2014 its $605 billion worth of imports into the U.S. surpassing Mexico, Canada and even China. The most valuable category was drugs and pharmaceuticals, followed by autos and aircraft and other heavy machinery. Trump has already threatened to impose a 200% tariff on any drugs imported into the U.S., though it would not be applied for at least 18 months.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded to Trump's letter, saying in a statement that \"few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices.\"",
      "But von der Leyen said she \"will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests,\" including retaliatory tariffs \"if required.\"",
      "Mexico meanwhile is another one of the United States' most important trading partners, with more than $505 billion worth of goods imported by American consumers and companies in 2024.",
      "Mexico made up 69% of U.S. vegetable imports and 51% of U.S. fresh fruit imports in recent years, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. With short shelf lives, produce could see price hikes faster than other goods.",
      "Markets had spent most of the week brushing off the earlier escalations, leaving stocks largely at the record highs they\u2019d regained thanks largely to recent weeks\u2019 trade-war lull. Trump himself touted the gains in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "But on Friday, major indexes closed lower on the heels of Trump vowing to hit Brazil, a key source of commodities like coffee and orange juice, with a 50% tariff. Trump said the tariff was so high because of \"unsustainable Trade Deficits\" even though the U.S. currently runs at a surplus in its trade with Brazil.",
      "Trump also said \"the way Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro ... is an international disgrace.\"",
      "In the case of the E.U., the bloc currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby that can be quickly implemented. Some of those retaliatory duties target goods made in Republican-represented states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana and bourbon from Kentucky, which is represented in the House and Senate by a nearly all-Republican delegation.",
      "Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",
      "Analysts say the new tariff onslaught adds further risk to an inflation outlook that has already been teetering on edge.",
      "\u201cHigher tariffs going into effect in August also could mean that inflationary effects come through later this year or even into next year, extending the timeline on higher inflation,\u201d analysts with Citi wrote in a note to clients published Friday.",

      "Speaking on Wednesday before the European Parliament, the E.U.\u2019s top trade official, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said negotiations were happening \u201cevery single day\u201d between the two sides. \u201cCrucially, while other nations faced increased tariffs from United States, the result of the letters that President Trump sent out on Monday, our negotiations have spared the E.U. from facing higher tariffs.\u201d",

      "Russia launched more aerial attacks on Ukraine in June than in any other month of the war so far, causing the highest number of civilians killed or wounded since the conflict broke out more than three years ago, according to a tally by the United Nations and independent researchers.",
      "The onslaught of armed drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles raining down on Ukrainian towns and cities has underscored Russia\u2019s determination to press on with its war against Ukraine despite President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to halt the bloodshed.",
      "The Russian aerial attacks have been steadily increasing since July 2024, with the number of strikes exceeding 2,500 in each of the first six months of this year, according to the nonprofit Institute for the Study of War, which cited figures from Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry.",
      "The difference over the same period last year is stark.",
      "Between January and June, Russian drone and missile attacks numbered 23,245, a roughly 605 % increase compared to the same period last year when there were 3,300, according to the Washington-based institute.",
      "The expansion was driven by a massive increase in drone assaults, which jumped from 2,264 in the first half of 2024 to 22,495 in the first half of 2025, according to the tally.",
      "As a result of those aerial attacks, the toll of civilians killed and wounded increased to 6,719, up about 53% from the same period in 2024, according to U.N. monitors. The civilian toll included 1,091 deaths and 5,628 wounded.",
      "\u201cCivilians across Ukraine are facing levels of suffering we have not seen in over three years,\u201d Danielle Bell, head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said in a statement. \u201cThe surge in long-range missile and drone strikes across the country has brought even more death and destruction to civilians far away from the frontline.\u201d",
      "June marked the highest monthly civilian casualty toll in three years, with 232 killed and 1,343 wounded, according to the United Nations.",
      "In the month of June, Russian forces fired 5,681 drones and missiles on Ukraine \u2013 the highest number since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The aerial assault included 5,438 drones and 243 missiles, according to the Institute for the Study of War.",
      "Russia has kept up the tempo of drone and missile attacks in July, forcing Ukrainians in cities to seek shelter underground in subway stations. Smoke rose over Kyiv on Wednesday and Thursday night from Russian drone and missile strikes that ignited fires and destroyed apartment buildings, NBC News and The Associated Press reported from the capital.",
      "On Wednesday night, Russia fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones on Ukraine, along with missiles. On Thursday night, 397 Iranian-designed Shahed and decoy drones were launched against Kyiv and other regions, according to Ukrainian officials.",
      "With Russian troops unable to score a breakthrough on the ground despite a significant manpower advantage, Moscow has stepped up its missile and drone attacks on the country\u2019s cities to try to overwhelm air defenses, undermine the resolve of the government in Kyiv before any peace talks, and break the will of the wider population, current and former Western diplomats say.",
      "\u201cThese attacks are on civilian targets, so it\u2019s an attempt to demoralize Ukrainians, to convince Ukrainians that they can\u2019t win,\u201d said William Taylor, a former career U.S. diplomat who served in Kyiv.",
      "Christina Harward, a Russian analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said previous attempts by Russia to damage morale have failed. The air attacks also indicated Russia\u2019s weapons production and stockpiles had increased, especially long-range drones, Harward said.",
      "\u201cRussia may also be trying to distract from the battlefield, where Russian gains on the front are still relatively slow and are coming at huge personnel costs,\u201d she said.",
      "Before he took office in January, Trump had pledged to end the war in \u201ca day.\u201d He initially suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government were the main obstacle to bringing an end to the conflict, which began with Russia\u2019s invasion of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "But in recent days, Trump\u2019s tone has shifted, with the president expressing impatience and frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin for offering what he called \u201cmeaningless\u201d moves toward peace."

      "Helicopters hovered above the mountain where the disarmament process got underway, with dozens of Iraqi Kurdish security forces surrounding the area, a Reuters witness said.",
      "The PKK, locked in conflict with the Turkish state and outlawed since 1984, decided in May to disband, disarm and end its separatist struggle after a public call to do so from its long-imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan.",
      "After a series of failed peace efforts, the new initiative could pave the way for Ankara to end an insurgency that has killed over 40,000 people, burdened the economy and wrought deep social and political divisions in Turkey and the wider region.",
      "The ceremony was held inside the Jasana cave in the town of Dukan, 37 miles northwest of Sulaymaniyah in the Kurdistan region of Iraq\u2018s north, according to an Iraqi security official and another regional government official.",
      "Around 40 PKK militants and one commander were to hand over their weapons, people familiar with the plan said. It was unclear when further handovers would take place.",
      "The PKK has been based in northern Iraq after being pushed well beyond Turkey\u2019s southeastern frontier in recent years. Turkey\u2019s military has regularly carried out operations and strikes on PKK bases in the region and established several military outposts there.",
      "No footage of the ceremony has been made available yet, but Turkish broadcasters have been showing the crowds gathered near Sulaymaniyah and landscapes of the mountainous region as part of their coverage of what they said was a historic moment.",
      "The arms are to be destroyed later in another ceremony attended by Turkish and Iraqi intelligence figures, officials of Iraq\u2018s Kurdistan regional government, and senior members of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish DEM party \u2014 which also played a key role in facilitating the PKK\u2019s disarmament decision.",

      "In a rare online video published on Wednesday, Ocalan also urged Turkey\u2019s parliament to set up a commission to oversee disarmament and manage the broader peace process.",
      "Ankara has taken steps toward forming the commission, while the DEM and Ocalan have said that legal assurances and certain mechanisms were needed to smooth the PKK\u2019s transition into democratic politics.",
      "Omer Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan\u2019s AK Party, said the disarmament process should not be allowed to drag on longer than a few months to avoid it becoming subject to provocations.",
      "Erdogan has said the disarmament will enable the rebuilding of Turkey\u2019s southeast.",
      "Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has said Turkey spent nearly $1.8 trillion over the past five decades combating terrorism, endorsing the peace steps as an economic boon.",
      "The end of NATO member Turkey\u2019s conflict with the PKK could have consequences across the region, including in neighboring Syria where the United States is allied with Syrian Kurdish forces that Ankara deems a PKK offshoot.",
      "Washington and Ankara want those Kurds to quickly integrate with Syria\u2019s security structure, which has been undergoing reconfiguration since the fall in December of autocratic President Bashar al-Assad. PKK disarmament could add to this pressure, analysts say."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium was buried beneath Iran\u2019s Isfahan facility by U.S. strikes and not destroyed or moved beforehand, a senior Israeli government official said in Washington on Wednesday night. But it is effectively unreachable, the official said, because Israel is watching, and if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the material, it will not hesitate to conduct new strikes.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s conclusion regarding the uranium at Isfahan, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump has said many times, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The entire world is safer thanks to his decisive leadership.\u201d",
      "In a lengthy briefing with reporters Wednesday night, the senior Israeli government official said Israel decided to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities because of intelligence it had that Tehran had begun rapidly and secretly proceeding to weaponize its enriched uranium after Israel\u2019s targeted assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September.",
      "The official said that Israel had shared the intelligence with President Donald Trump but was preparing to strike with or without a green light or participation from the United States and that American support was not a condition for Israel\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The official would not specify the source of the intelligence.",
      "Iran denies that it wants to build a nuclear weapon. In an interview with NBC News a day before the U.S. strikes, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said every country has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.",
      "\u201cThis is an achievement of our own scientists. It\u2019s a question of national pride and dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked about National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s having testified before Congress in March that the U.S. intelligence community \u201ccontinues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,\u201d the Israeli official dismissed the question, viewing the assessment as not serious.",
      "According to the official, Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has now been set back up to two years.",
      "An initial assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency leaked late last month found that the U.S. strikes on Isfahan and two other sites may have set back the program only several months.",
      "The question of how damaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u2014 along with how much its timeline toward building a nuclear weapon should it ever decide to do so was delayed \u2014 has been a politically charged one. Trump and his administration have denounced the leak of the DIA assessment and the outlets that first reported it.",
      "The day after the initial DIA assessment was first reported, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that \u201ca body of credible intelligence\u201d indicated the program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis includes new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\u201d he said."
