      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

The 40-year-old actor and producer rose to fame playing April Ludgate on the television series \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and was nominated for an Emmy for her role on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d The couple married in 2021.",
      "\u201cThe opportunities to create together, to do something creative where we're both fulfilled, it's like how rare is that? She's down and she's so talented, so I'm really lucky,\" Baena said.",
      "A representative for Plaza said that in addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother, Barbara Stern, stepfather Roger Stern, father Scott Baena, stepmother Michele Baena, brother Brad Baena and stepsiblings Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman."

      "\u201cHe sat me down and really explained some things that he thought would accelerate this process for me,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce bantered with the guests during commercial breaks and took questions from a few of about 300 fans in the audience. When a fan from New Jersey invited Kelce to his wedding, the retired star quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t go into New Jersey.\u201d",
      "Eagles fan and Penn State student Caleb Tinley learned only two days earlier he was randomly selected for a pair of free tickets and was first in line around noon to get a good seat for the taping. He\u2019s a fan of the \u201c New Heights \u201d podcast Kelce co-hosts with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and figured the TV show was as close to that experience as he could get.",
      "\u201cEver since he had that speech at the Super Bowl, he became a Philly legend,\u201d Tinley said.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who retired in March after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles \u2014 has watched his profile balloon in retirement. The Super Bowl winner already hosted the podcast but has become a prolific pitchman hawking everything from chicken wings to soup, to laundry detergent to cereal, to hoagies to his own beer company.",
      "Kelce was already omnipresent on television and social media, so what was one more gig to add to his resume?",
      "So \u201cLate Night\u201d was born.",
      "Kelce is in the first year of a multiyear agreement with ESPN and already appears on the network\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d show. The retired center taking center stage on a late-night staple such as a talk show \u2014 no Letterman, though he did wear his Cleveland Heights letterman's jacket \u2014 seemed a natural extension into his growing entertainment profile.",
      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and his wife peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home, where the couple raise three daughters, with a fourth expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs such as Toronto, Los Angeles and New York \u2014 than in those in Asia, including Hong Kong and Taipei",
      "Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Thomas Lo is now the one giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.",
      "The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the island city's biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content to reach viewers around the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Lo told The Associated Press. \u201cYou see more Asians but you\u2019re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We\u2019re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it\u2019s not just in front of the camera. It\u2019s behind the camera as well.\u201d",
      "It's vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs \u2014 Toronto, Los Angeles, New York \u2014 than in those in Asia \u2014 such as Hong Kong or Taipei. Actors in Asia don't as often have to deal with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenized. Historically, many Asian American and Canadian actors have even relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.",
      "A few film and TV producers on both sides of the Pacific, however, are looking to shake up those dynamics by crisscrossing their show biz ecosystems. The hope is a win-win with fledgling talent in the Asian diaspora gaining global exposure \u2014 and Asia-based productions getting wider audiences. For example the Hulu series \u201cShogun,\u201d which won 18 Emmys, demonstrated a successful collaboration between Japanese and Western cast and crew \u2014 which included Japanese Americans.",
      "At the helm of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Lo led its first collaboration with an American company \u2014 on an original TV drama with scenes in both English and Cantonese. Two crews on two different continents filmed \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d a series about a Chinese American aspiring music producer in Los Angeles (Nathan Ing) who becomes telepathically connected to a Hong Kong advertising executive (Cantopop singer Jocelyn Chan).",
      "Chan, 30, was born in Hong Kong but spent ages 3-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She returned to Hong Kong for her music career partly because of concern about succeeding in North America.",
      "\u201cA lot of people probably had similar sentiments to me where it's more possible if we came back to this home,\u201d Chan said of finding success in the entertainment industry in Asia. \u201cWe all feel like we have two homes.\u201d",
      "Her role in \u201cCross My Mind\u201d is powerful, assertive and far from Western stereotypes of Asian women as meek.",
      "The partnership between Los Angeles-based Wong Fu Productions and TVB started with one side sliding into the other's DMs on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be cool if we can kind of tap into their audience of what they built because that\u2019s who we\u2019re trying to speak with,\u201d Lo said, about reaching Asian American viewers.",
      "Wong Fu, which started in 2003, is now a thriving YouTube channel of Asian American-centered skits and other content. Simu Liu was among its then-emerging actors.",
      "\u201cNow we have actors that want to work with us for free and are just like \u2018Put us in whatever,\u2019 knowing that it\u2019s a way to connect with Asian Americans first,\u201d said Wesley Chan, Wong Fu co-founder and creative director. \u201cThen that can also be a way to propel them.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan, no relation to Jocelyn, was intrigued by the challenge of shepherding a story that incorporates Asian and Asian American protagonists. He and his team wrote six episodes of \u201cCross My Mind\u201d in six months to film in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe knew that they wanted to make a story that could kind of show the cultural differences between an American and someone in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was really cool because to even know that there is a difference \u2014 or to share that there\u2019s a difference \u2014 I think is a nuance that is not seen very often.\u201d",
      "Meshing work styles was no small feat. Wesley Chan noticed crews in Los Angeles and Hong Kong \u2014 where there are no unions \u2014 worked differently. It in some ways paralleled the bicultural nature of the show itself.",
      "The show premiered in April 2023 on myTV Super, TVB's streaming platform that has 9 million subscribers. It debuted the following December in the U.S. on two new streaming platforms that have since merged into GoldenTV, which focuses on English language content for Asian American viewers.",
      "\u201cThere's two different audiences on both sides of the world, but it\u2019s still content that I think has eyeballs,\u201d said Takashi Cheng, GoldenTV's founder. \u201cThe fact that they need English-language programming tells you that American or English content is not dead. It\u2019s in fact very much attractive in foreign countries.\u201d",
      "GoldenTV has gained thousands of subscribers since launching nearly two years ago, Cheng said. The platform plans to grow with unscripted shows. In September, it premiered entertainment news show \"The Takeaway,\u201d hosted by influencer Michelle Park. Actor Daniel Wu (\"American Born Chinese\") is developing a docuseries on his love of racing.",
      "Wu, 50, rose to fame after moving to Hong Kong. Someone like Wu \u2014 who was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, became a Hong Kong cinema star and then pivoted to Hollywood \u2014 is a \u201crarity,\" Lo said. Before digital audiences, it was difficult to alternate between Asian and American screens, he continued.",
      "\u201cI think we were a breath of fresh air for those actors and talents and artists, when we said that we\u2019re going to be producing English content,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThere is an audience that\u2019s untapped here.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan said Wong Fu is not ruling out being \u201ca conduit\u201d for more crossover collaborations.",
      "Jocelyn Chan is still maintaining her singing career with hit singles and a solo Hong Kong concert this year. But she says the success of \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d has given her the courage to think about acting beyond Hong Kong. She\u2019s now looking for an agent in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt kind of pushed me to not wait,\u201d said Chan, who is also a sound healer and practitioner. She also thinks there's more space for talent who grew up bicultural. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an even more niche representation within the wider Asian representation.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Movie ticket sales are taking a bit of a hit in 2024",
      "Movie ticket sales took a bit of a hit in 2024. The annual domestic box office is expected to end up at around $8.75 billion, down more than 3% from 2023, according to estimates from Comscore.",
      "It\u2019s not as dire as it was in the pandemic years, but it\u2019s also not even close to the pre-pandemic norm when the annual box office regularly surpassed $11 billion.",
      "This is the year the business felt the effects of the Hollywood strikes of 2023, the labor standoff that delayed productions and releases and led to a depleted calendar for exhibitors and moviegoers. And yet it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been, or at least as bad as analysts projected at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThis has been a really incredible comeback story for the industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cJust a couple of months ago it was a question of whether we would even hit $8 billion for the year.\u201d",
      "Hollywood continues to learn lessons about what moviegoers really want, what works and what doesn\u2019t. Here are the biggest takeaways from 2024.",
      "The Hollywood strikes might have ended in 2023, putting productions back into full swing and sending stars out on the promotional circuit again \u2014 but the ripple effect of the work stoppages and contract standoffs showed their real effects on the 2024 release calendar.",
      "The first two quarters were hit hardest, with tentpoles pushed later in the year (\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d for one) or even into 2025 (like \u201cMission: Impossible 8\u201d). With no Marvel movie kicking off the summer moviegoing season, the box office was down a devastating 27.5% from 2023 right before \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened in June.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unpredictable business but it thrives on stability,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhen the release calendar is thrown off, the momentum stops.\u201d",
      "Sequels and franchises dominated the top 10 movies of the year, as has often been the case in the past 15 years. But this year, films carrying a PG rating did especially well, starting with the biggest movie of 2024: \u201cInside Out 2,\" which also became the biggest animated movie of all time, not accounting for inflation.",
      "Family films with a PG rating \u2014 including \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d\u201cMoana 2,\u201d\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d \u201cMufasa\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d \u2014 grossed over $2.9 billion this year, accounting for around 33% of the annual box office, according to Comscore. Movies rated PG-13, by contrast, made up about 30% of ticket sales.",
      "After a quieter 2023 and several years without a film at the very top of the charts, the Walt Disney Co. came back roaring in 2024 with three of the top five movies of the year: \"Inside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d In mid-December, it crossed the $2 billion domestic mark, the second time any studio has done so since 2019 (that was also Disney, in 2022). Its 20th Century division also played an important part with \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different industry when Disney commits to theatrical releases,\u201d said Daniel Loria, an executive at the movie data and analytics trade The Boxoffice Company.",
      "Every year has high-profile flops and disappointments, and this was no exception. Sony had a rough go with its \u201cSpider-Man\u201d adjacent titles like \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d (but this also seems to be the fate lately for anyone not named \u201cDeadpool\u201d). Universal had higher hopes for \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d as did Warner Bros. for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d",
      "Then there were the filmmaker-driven (and financed) passion projects that failed to take off like Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201cHorizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reductive way of thinking about those passion projects,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThose movies didn\u2019t come out with huge expectations, meaning theaters didn\u2019t clear out the house and give them three auditoriums per site in hopes for money to come in.\u201d",
      "This was, however, part of the problem with \u201cJoker 2,\u201d which was expected to be more in line with the first which made over $1 billion. But even that has a caveat, Loria thinks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that \u2018Joker\u2019 didn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s that there was nothing coming in behind it to make up that momentum,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThat\u2019s more the fault of a release schedule where one movie is supposed to carry a month. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d",
      "What does work, Loria said, is a diverse lineup, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas successes being the perfect example. At Thanksgiving, there was \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d Christmas had \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cSonic 3,\u201d and a lot of adult offerings too, including \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "Horror is often the safest bet for theatrical, but this year had even veterans pleasantly surprised by just how enthusiastic that audience can be, with hits like \u201cLonglegs,\u201d \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d and \u201cSmile 2\u201d getting people out of the house.",
      "The Blake Lively drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\" which had its share of ongoing off-screen drama as well, also became an event. Audiences turned out for smart thrillers, like \u201cConclave\u201d as well as unexpected originals including \u201cAnora,\" \u201cThe Substance\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Re-releases of movies in theaters that are also widely available in the home thrived this year. Some of the biggest successes included Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar,\"\u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said in December. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it.\"",
      "As silly as it sounds, this is the year the novelty popcorn bucket became a star. It started with the accidentally suggestive \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d creation, which \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d latched onto in a less accidental way. More recently, the \u201cNosferatu\u201d coffin buckets have been fetching high resale prices.",
      "For Loria, it\u2019s all part of a trend that theaters have been noticing since reopening during the pandemic: Moviegoers aren\u2019t back in pre-pandemic numbers, but those who did come back were spending more on concessions and premium tickets (like IMAX and other large format screens) than ever before.",
      "Everyone is optimistic for the film business in 2025, and the offerings for moviegoers \u2014 which include at least 110 films projected to open on over 2,000 screens \u2014 according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. And the momentum is there.",
      "\u201cThere's been a huge amount of box office generated in the last six weeks of the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is the best opening act 2025 could have.\u201d"

      "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is starting the new year with her first Instagram account since 2020",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is starting the new year with her first Instagram account since 2020.",
      "The Associated Press confirmed Wednesday that @meghan belongs to the Duchess of Sussex. Her first post is a black and white video of herself at the beach, wearing white and drawing 2025 in the sand on an overcast day. The account already has more than 200,000 followers.",
      "Meghan and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, were married in 2018, and were initially part of @KensingtonRoyal, which also included Harry's brother, Prince William, and his wife, Kate, the Princess of Wales. But a year later, Meghan and Harry launched their own account, @SussexRoyal, a sign of their growing distance from the royal family. @SussexRoyal was discontinued in 2020, around the time that Meghan and Harry announced they were stepping back from their official roles.",
      "Meghan, who had a popular Instagram account when she was best known for her role in \u201cSuits,\u201d had indicated she would return. In a 2022 interview with New York Magazine's The Cut, she confided: \u201cDo you want to know a secret? I\u2019m getting back \u2026 on Instagram.\"",
      "At other times, she sounded reluctant to return to Instagram, citing concerns about harassment. In 2023, Meghan and Harry urged social media platforms to strengthen content-moderation policies, saying that some apps could damage the mental health of young people."

      "Actor Blake Lively has sued the director of the film \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d alleging harassment on the set and a coordinated campaign to smear her reputation",
      "Actor Blake Lively sued \"It Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Lively's suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign.",
      "The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "Lively's suit said that Baldoni, the film's production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\u201d by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits.",
      "The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively.",
      "The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath \u201cdiscussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lively's lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively's lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least $250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit.",
      "Others who are defendants in Lively's suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit.",
      "The libel lawsuit says the newspaper \u201crelied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that \u201cour story was meticulously and responsibly reported.\"",
      "\u201cIt was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the statement said.",
      "But Baldoni's lawsuit says that \u201cIf the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that \u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today.\"",
      "The romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were \u201cabsolutely entitled to that opinion.\u201d",
      "He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Freedman, said in a statement on the libel suit that \u201cthe New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful \u2018untouchable\u2019 Hollywood elites.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public,\" he added. \"The irony is rich.\u201d",

      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications during a recent five-year period",
      "As U.S. lawmakers debate issues around health care for transgender youth, it\u2019s been difficult to determine the number of young people receiving gender-affirming medications, leaving room for exaggerated and false claims.",
      "Now, a medical journal has published the most reliable estimate yet and the numbers are low, reflecting more clearly on medical practices now being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications \u2014 puberty blockers or hormones \u2014 during a recent five-year period, according to the study released Monday.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A decision by the Supreme Court in a Tennessee case is expected later this year. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "\u201cWe are not seeing inappropriate use of this sort of care,\" said lead author Landon Hughes, a Harvard University public health researcher. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not happening at the rate at which people often think it is.\u201d",
      "The researchers analyzed a large insurance claims database covering more than 5 million patients ages 8 to 17.",
      "Only 926 adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, suggest that fewer than 0.1% of all youth in the database received these medications.",
      "The researchers found that no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, an indication that doctors are appropriately cautious about when to start such treatments, Hughes said.",
      "\u201cI hope that our paper cools heads on this issue and ensures that the public is getting a true sense of the number of people who are accessing this care,\u201d he said.",
      "The database included insurance plans in all 50 states, but did not include youth covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people.",
      "The study did not look at surgeries among transgender adolescents. Other researchers have found those procedures are extremely rare among young people.",
      "Not all transgender youth proceed with medical treatments, said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, co-lead author of the adolescent standards of care for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a leading transgender health group.",
      "Transgender adolescents \u201ccome to understand their gender at different times and in different ways,\u201d he said, noting that the best care should include experts in adolescent identity development who can work with families to help figure out what\u2019s appropriate for each young person.",
      "Leibowitz, who has worked in gender clinics in several U.S. cities, said the study \u201cadds to the growing evidence base about best practices when serving transgender and gender diverse youth.\u201d",

      "Indonesia\u2019s new government has begun an ambitious project to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",
      "Subianto\u2019s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and \u201cWe are capable.\u201d",
      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",

      "Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe",
      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe.",
      "These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable.",
      "Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe.",
      "The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast.",
      "Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",
      "Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.",
      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

But in Oregon and elsewhere in the country, progressive lawmakers' attempts to expand abortion access sometimes clash with rural constituencies.",
      "",
      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",
      "",
      "It's a divide that has played out in elections in such states as Nevada, where voters passed a ballot measure in November that seeks to codify abortion protections in the state constitution. Residents in several rural counties opposed the measure.",

      "In Oregon, during the months just before the Baker City closure was announced, Democratic state lawmakers were focused on a proposed pilot program that would launch two mobile reproductive healthcare clinics in rural areas. The bill specified that the van-based clinics would include abortion services.",

      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",
      "",
      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",

      "Flu is taking off in the U.S., with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week",
      "The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data.",
      "\u201cA lot of flu out there,\u201d said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Carrie Reed.",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs, Reed said. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added.",
      "Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but \u201cinfluenza has now joined the party,\u201d said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious diseases specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re really starting to roll,\u201d he added. \u201dOur hospitals are busy.\u201d",
      "One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor\u2019s office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter\u2019s respiratory virus season \u2014 which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses.",
      "Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and western U.S. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England.",
      "So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths \u2014 including at least 11 children.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said.",
      "U.S. health officials recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it\u2019s not too late to get a shot.",
      "You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick.",
      "The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December.",
      "Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week.",
      "The cases are \u201cfairly sporadic\u201d and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

    "summary": "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
    "story": [
      "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As Colorado becomes the second state to legalize psychedelic therapy this week, a clash is playing out in Colorado Springs, where conservative leaders are restricting the treatment over objections from some of the city's 90,000 veterans, who've become flagbearers for psychedelic therapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Colorado residents voted to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the chemical compound found in psychedelic mushrooms, in a 2022 ballot measure, launching two years of rulemaking before it could be used to treat conditions such as depression and PTSD.",
      "This week, companies and people will be able to apply for licenses to administer the mind-altering drug, though treatment will likely not be available for some months as applications are processed.",
      "Colorado joined Oregon in legalizing psilocybin therapy, though the drug remains illegal in most other states and federally. Over the last year, a growing number of Oregon cities have voted to ban psilocybin. While Colorado metros cannot ban the treatment under state law, several conservative cities have worked to preemptively restrict what are known as \u201chealing centers.\u201d",
      "At a City Council meeting in Colorado Springs this month, members were set to vote on extending the state prohibition on healing centers from 1,000 feet (305 meters) to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from certain locations, such as schools. From the lectern, veterans implored them not to.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to support veterans, and it\u2019s a really easy one to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to,\u201d said Lane Belone, a special forces veteran who said he's benefited from his own psychedelic experiences. Belone argued that the restrictions effectively limit the number of centers and would mean longer waiting lists for the treatment.",
      "Veterans have pulled in some conservative support for psychedelic therapy \u2014 managing to set it apart from other politically charged drug policies such as legalizing marijuana.",
      "That distinction was made clear by Councilmember David Leinweber, who said at the council meeting both that marijuana is \u201cliterally killing our kids\u201d and that he supported greater access to psilocybin therapy.",
      "Psilocybin is far more restricted in Colorado than marijuana, which the state legalized in 2014. Psilocybin is decriminalized but there won\u2019t be recreational dispensaries for the substance, which will be largely confined to licensed businesses and therapy sessions with licensed facilitators.",
      "Patients will have to go through a risk assessment, preliminary meetings, then follow-up sessions and remain with a facilitator while under the drug's influence. The psilocybin will also be tested, and the companies that grow them regulated by a state agency.",
      "Still, allowing broader access to the treatment hasn't been easy for most of the city councilmembers, including three who are veterans. Colorado Springs is home to two Air Force bases and the U.S. Air Force Academy, and local leaders frequently tout it as an ideal community for retired service members.",
      "\u201cI will never sit up here and criticize a veteran for wanting to find a medical treatment to fix or to help with the issues that they carry,\u201d said Council President Randy Helms, a veteran himself.",
      "Still, he continued, \u201cDo I think that it\u2019s helpful to not just veterans but to individuals? Probably so. Do I think it still needs to be tested under strict requirements? Yes.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Springs City Council passed the proposed restrictions.",
      "While research has shown promise for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA, also known as molly, in helping people with conditions such as alcoholism, depression and PTSD, the scientific field remains in its relatively early stages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the potential value, but I\u2019m very concerned that we\u2019ve gotten too far ahead of our skis,\u201d said Jeffrey Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who's been involved in studies of psychedelic drugs' therapeutic efficacy.",
      "The risks, said Lieberman, include customers being misled and paying out of pocket for expensive treatments. He also said there are cases where the drugs can exacerbate some extreme mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.",
      "In Oregon, where the treatments started in June 2023, costs can reach $2,000 for one session. Of the over 16,000 doses administered in the state, staff have only called 911 or taken a patient to the hospital five times.",
      "Other Colorado Springs city councilmembers raised concerns that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved psilocybin to treat mental health conditions and, in August, rejected the psychedelic MDMA to treat PTSD. A number of clinical trials are still underway for both drugs.",
      "Some researchers, advocacy groups and veterans worry that waiting on slow-moving bureaucracy \u2014 namely the FDA \u2014 carries its own risks as people continue to struggle with mental illnesses. Advocates argue that psychedelic therapy offers an option to those for whom talk therapy alone and antidepressants have not helped.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis that we are in, and this is a tool that we can add to our toolbox,\u201d said Taylor West, executive director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, which advocates for psychedelic therapy.",
      "Belone said he's carried his military experience long after leaving the special forces. It started when he first heard artillery sirens wailing in a U.S. base in Iraq, his breath catching with fear for a few thudding moments.",
      "That fear kept him on edge when he returned stateside and found himself always keeping his back to the wall, looking for exits to the room he was in, never quite able to give himself fully to the music at a concert.",
      "A psychedelic experience with psilocybin, said Belone, helped him connect the fear that attached to him in the war zone to the ceaseless anxiety at home. It didn\u2019t solve everything overnight, he said, but it allowed him to better identify when that humming fear was getting in the way of a joyful life.",

      "",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",

      "\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",

      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines.

      "HSINCHU, Taiwan -- Taiwan began three days of military drills on Tuesday as concerns rose over potential cuts to the defense budget due to legislative wrangling between the island's two major political parties.",
      "The drills began in the north with tank maneuvering at a base in Hsinchu featuring outmoded CM-11 tanks, which are gradually being replaced by newly purchased Abrams M1A2T from the U.S. The replacement marks a huge upgrade despite some complaints over the weight of the new tanks and their likely effectiveness at preventing a possible Chinese landing.",
      "Troops arrived on armored personnel carriers, while Apache and S-70 helicopters whirled overhead, providing reconnaissance and covering fire.",
      "With the equipment Taiwan currently operates, the communication officer is on the ground to coordinate airborne attacks, said Army Captain Chuang Yuan-cheng of the 542 Armored Brigade in Hsinchu county just south of the capital of Taipei. That allows them to guide the helicopters so that \u201cground fire and airborne fire are synchronized,\u201d Chuang said.",

      "ACAPULCO, Mexico -- About 100 migrants from various countries wandered directionless and disoriented through the streets of the troubled Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.",
      "After walking for a couple weeks through southern Mexico with hundreds of other migrants, they accepted an offer from immigration officials to come to Acapulco with the idea they could continue their journey north toward the U.S. border. Instead, they found themselves stuck on Monday.",
      "Two weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration, Mexico continues dissolving attention-grabbing migrant caravans and dispersing migrants throughout the country to keep them far from the U.S. border, while simultaneously limiting how many accumulate in any one place.",
      "The policy of \u201cdispersion and exhaustion\u201d has become the center of the Mexican government\u2019s immigration policy in recent years and last year succeeded in significantly reducing the number of migrants reaching the U.S. border, said Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, former chief of Mexico\u2019s immigration agency.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current administration hopes that the lower numbers will give them some defense from Trump\u2019s pressures, said Guillen, who left the administration of former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador after Trump threatened to impose tariffs over migration during his first presidency.",
      "Acapulco would seem to be a strange destination for migrants. Once a crown jewel of Mexico\u2019s tourism industry, the city now suffers under the thumb of organized crime and is still struggling to climb back after taking a direct hit from devastating Hurricane Otis in 2023.",
      "On Monday, Mexican tourists enjoyed the final hours of their holiday beach vacations while migrants slept in the street or tried to find ways to resume their journeys north.",
      "\u201cImmigration (officials) told us they were going to give us a permit to transit the country freely for 10, 15 days and it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d said a 28-year-old Venezuelan, Ender Antonio Casta\u00f1eda. \u201cThey left us dumped here without any way to get out. They won\u2019t sell us (bus) tickets, they won\u2019t sell us anything.\u201d",
      "Casta\u00f1eda, like thousands of other migrants, had left the southern city of Tapachula near the Guatemalan border. More than a half dozen caravans of about 1,500 migrants each have set out from Tapachula in recent weeks, but none of them made it very far.",
      "Authorities let them walk for days until they\u2019re exhausted and then offer to bus them to various cities where they say their immigration status will be reviewed, which could mean any number of things.",
      "Some have landed in Acapulco, where about a dozen sleep at a Catholic church near the immigration agency offices.",
      "Several dozen gathered outside the offices Monday looking for information, but no one would tell them anything. Casta\u00f1eda, who had just received money from his family and was desperate to leave, picked a van driver he judged to be the most trustworthy among various offering rides for up to five times the normal price for a bus ticket to Mexico City",
      "Some migrants have discovered the permits authorities give them allow them to travel only within the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located. Other migrants have better luck.",
      "On Sunday, the latest migrant caravan broke up after hundreds received free transit permits to go anywhere in Mexico for a specified number of days.",
      "Cuban Dayani S\u00e1nchez, 33, and her husband were among them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a little scared by the lack of safety getting on buses, that they\u2019re going to stop us,\u201d she said. Mexico\u2019s drug cartels frequently target migrants for kidnapping and extortion, though many migrants say authorities extort them too.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum insists her immigration strategy has a \u201chumanitarian\u201d focus, and has allowed more migrants to leave southernmost Mexico. But some migration advocates note that migrants are being taken to violent areas.",
      "It\u2019s a concern shared by the Rev. Leopoldo Morales, the priest at the Catholic church in Acapulco near the immigration agency office.",
      "He said that in November two or three immigration agency buses arrived with migrants, including entire families. Last weekend, two more arrived carrying all adults.",
      "Even though Acapulco isn\u2019t on the usual migration route and was unprepared to receive migrants, several priests have coordinated support for them with water, food and clothing. \u201cWe know they\u2019re going through a very difficult time, with a lot of needs, they arrive without money,\u201d Morales said.",
      "Migrants quickly realize that finding work in Acapulco is difficult. After Otis\u2019 destruction, the federal government sent hundreds of soldiers and National Guard troops to provide security and start reconstruction. Last year, another storm, John, brought widespread flooding.",
      "But violence in Acapulco hasn\u2019t relented.",
      "Acapulco has one of Mexico\u2019s highest rates of homicides. Cab drivers and small business owners complain \u2013 anonymously \u2013 of rising extortion. Large companies have balked at rebuilding under the current circumstances.",

      "Israel and Hamas are once again struggling to reach a ceasefire that could wind down the 15-month war in Gaza and bring home dozens of Israelis held hostage",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel and Hamas once again appear to be inching toward a ceasefire that could wind down the 15-month war in Gaza and bring home dozens of Israelis held hostage there.",
      "Both Israel and Hamas are under pressure from outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump to reach a deal before the Jan. 20 inauguration. But the sides have come close before, only to have talks collapse over various disagreements.",
      "The latest round of negotiations has bogged down over the names of hostages to be released in a first phase, according to Israeli, Egyptian and Hamas officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing ongoing negotiations.",
      "Israel wants assurances that the hostages are alive, while Hamas says that after months of heavy fighting, it isn't sure who is alive or dead.",
      "Other hurdles remain.",
      "The first phase, expected to last for six to eight weeks, would also include a halt in fighting, a release of Palestinian prisoners and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, according to the officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war, and talks on reconstruction and who will govern Gaza going forward.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t get it across the finish line in the next two weeks, I\u2019m confident that it will get to completion at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Seoul on Monday.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at the key issues holding up a deal:",
      "During its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages into Gaza. A truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year.",
      "Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza \u2014 at least a third of whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity.",
      "The first batch of hostages to be released is expected to be made up mostly of women, older people and people with medical conditions, according to the Israeli, Egyptian and Hamas officials.",
      "On Monday, a Hamas official shared with AP a list of 34 names of hostages it said were slated for release. An Egyptian official confirmed the list had been the focus of recent discussions.",
      "But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the names were from a list Israel had submitted months ago. \u201cAs of now, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment by Hamas regarding the status of the hostages appearing on the list,\u201d it said.",
      "A second Hamas official on Monday released a list of 14 names the group claimed Israel had removed from consideration after they were approved by Hamas and substituted with other names. Israel did not respond for a request for comment, but it has pronounced the 14 people dead.",
      "An Israeli official said the current impasse was due to Hamas' refusal to provide information on the conditions of the hostages, while another official said the departure of the head of the Mossad intelligence agency for negotiations in Qatar was on hold.",
      "A Hamas official, meanwhile, said that \u201cno one knows\u201d the conditions of all of the hostages. Hamas officials have said that due to the war, they cannot provide a full accounting until there is a truce.",
      "Since the war began, over 45,800 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of those killed. They do not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Families of hostages reacted angrily to reports of the phased approach, saying the government should instead be pursuing a deal that releases all the captives at once. They say time is running out to bring people home safely.",
      "\u201cThis morning, I and everyone in Israel woke up and discovered that the state of Israel has put together a Schindler's List \u2014 34 people who will be able to hug their families again, and 66 others whose fate will be sealed,\u201d said Yotam Cohen, whose brother Nimrod, an Israeli soldier held hostage, did not appear on the published list.",
      "Netanyahu has said he supports a partial deal that pauses the war, but he has rejected Hamas' demands for a full Israeli withdrawal that would end the war. Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until he achieves \u201ctotal victory\u201d \u2014 including the destruction of Hamas' military capabilities.",
      "Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas. But the group continues to stage attacks in Gaza and to fire rockets into Israel. That could portend an open-ended war that could drag on for months or years.",
      "The Hostages Forum, a grassroots group representing many hostage families, said it was time for a comprehensive deal.",
      "\u201cWe know more than half are still alive and need immediate rehabilitation, while those who were murdered must be returned for proper burial,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have no more time to waste. A hostage ceasefire agreement must be sealed now!\u201d",
      "As part of the deal, Israel is expected to free hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians, including dozens who were convicted in bloody attacks.",
      "Israel has a history of large-scale prisoner releases, and hundreds were freed in the November 2023 deal. But the sides have disagreed over the exact number and names of the prisoners to be freed. Hamas wants high-profile prisoners included. Israeli officials have ruled out the release of Marwan Barghouti, who tops Hamas' wish list.",
      "Netanyahu's governing coalition includes hardliners who oppose such releases, with some even pledging to quit the government if too many concessions are made. They point to a 2011 prisoner release that included the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks who was killed by Israel in October.",
      "The war has displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people, according to U.N. estimates, with the hard-hit northern sector of the territory largely emptied of its prewar population.",
      "During the first phase of the developing deal, Israel is expected to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers and allow some of the displaced to return home. But the extent of the pullback and the number of people allowed to return must still be worked out, the officials say.",

      "Austria could soon have its first government led by the far right since World War II",
      "VIENNA, Austria -- A party that advocates an end to economic sanctions against Russia and has called for the \u201cre-migration of uninvited foreigners\u201d could soon give Austria its first government led by the far right since World War II, with a leader who has a provocative style at its helm.",
      "Attempts to form a government without the far-right Freedom Party collapsed in recent days, more than three months after it won a parliamentary election. President Alexander Van der Bellen on Monday tasked its leader, Herbert Kickl, with trying to put together a coalition in the coming weeks or months.",
      "The Freedom Party was founded in 1956 by former Nazis and, over the decades, has become an established political force in Austria. It has led provincial governments and served as a junior partner in national governments \u2014 but never led a national administration until now.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the stakes if Kickl succeeds in forming a new government:",
      "The Freedom Party has come back strongly since its last stint in government ended in a scandal in 2019, benefiting from rising voter anger about immigration and inflation.",
      "In September's legislative elections, the party won 28.8% of the vote, a nearly 13-point gain from four years earlier. The governing conservative Austrian People's Party came in second with 26.3% and the Social Democrats third with 21.1%.",
      "It's usual for Austrian elections to result in coalitions, but this result was particularly complicated because none of the other party leaders at the time were prepared to go into government with the Freedom Party under Kickl.",
      "The president asked outgoing Chancellor Karl Nehammer to try to set up a new government, but talks on potential coalitions without the far right stumbled over how to get Austria's budget in shape and revive the economy. On Saturday, Nehammer said he would resign.",
      "Van der Bellen then called in Kickl \u2013 a sharp-tongued provocateur who last year mocked the now 80-year-old president as \u201ca mummy\u201d and \u201csenile\u201d \u2013 for talks that led to Monday\u2019s offer for the Freedom Party to try to form a new government.",
      "The 56-year-old is known for overstepping accepted boundaries and shocking the political establishment.",
      "A former speechwriter for late former far-right leader J\u00f6rg Haider and a longtime campaign strategist who coined catchy and provocative anti-immigration slogans, Kickl was interior minister from 2017 to 2019 when the Freedom Party was a junior partner in a coalition government under conservative then-Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. He became the Freedom Party leader in June 2021.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kickl joined some other critics of the World Health Organization in advocating use of ivermectin, a medicine for treatment of parasitic worms in animals, to treat the disease.",
      "The Freedom Party over the years has attracted a neo-Nazi fringe, but it has publicly disassociated itself from decades of covert antisemitism. In 2015, a party lawmaker was expelled for backing an antisemitic comment on social media and Kickl, the party's general secretary at the time, said she had \u201ccrossed a red line.\u201d",
      "While interior minister in 2018, Kickl denied any intention of being provocative when he said asylum-seekers in Austria might be held \u201cin a concentrated way in one place\u201d as authorities assessed their applications.",
      "Years after financial crisis drove a wedge in the European bloc, and nearly five years after Brexit, the European Union is facing a new sign of internal discord: The 27-member bloc has been a stalwart supporter of Ukraine, but unity is fraying.",
      "Austria, which has a longstanding policy of military neutrality, has not provided weapons to Ukraine.",
      "Far-right movements have been on the rise in the EU in recent years. The U.S presidential election victory of Donald Trump \u2013 who shares many of their values and policy positions \u2013 in November has further emboldened them.",
      "But concern lingers about the rise of hard-right movements in Europe.",
      "Alon Ischay of the Austrian Union of Jewish Students said the turn to Kickl was \u201cimportant\" and expressed concerns about how the Freedom Party leader has used the term \u201cVolkskanzler\u201d \u2014 the people\u2019s chancellor \u2014 which was used by the Nazis to describe Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Kickl has rejected the comparison.",
      "\u201cThat this person might get the mandate to form a government is unacceptable to us,\u201d said Ischay, who was among hundreds of protesters outside the presidential palace on Monday.",
      "The Freedom Party is pro-Russian and skeptical about EU mandates, calling for a \u201cFortress Austria\u201d that can wrest decision-making power from Brussels. The party\u2019s rise has coincided with rising voter anger about immigration and inflation.",
      "The Freedom Party is part of a right-wing populist alliance in the European Parliament, Patriots for Europe.",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, seen by many as the most pro-Russia leader of any EU country, hailed \u201can historic victory\u201d for the Freedom Party after Austria's elections in September.

      "PARIS -- Police in France have arrested three Algerian men described by authorities as social media influencers accused of posting videos inciting violence, against a backdrop of soured relations between Paris and its former colony in North Africa.",
      "French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced the latest arrest Sunday evening \u2014 the third in as many days. A French media report that the minister attached to his post on X said the influencer posted a video to his 138,000 followers on TikTok that French authorities deemed anti-Semitic.",
      "The arrest in Montpellier, southern France, and two others in the Alpine city of Grenoble and the western port city of Brest come amid renewed turbulence in the often complicated relationship between France and Algeria, which shook off French rule in 1962 after a brutal war.",
      "A shift last July in France's decades-old position on the disputed Western Sahara region of northern Africa angered Algeria and prompted the withdrawal of its ambassador in Paris.",

      "The French government hasn't linked the tensions with Algiers to the three arrests.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said Sunday that France wants \u201cthe best relations\u201d with Algeria. But he said Paris has doubts about the Algerian government's commitment to deals agreed in 2022 that were seen as important steps toward mending their relationship.",
      "The first Algerian influencer arrested, a 25-year-old who reportedly had more than 400,000 followers on TikTok before his account was closed down, was detained Friday morning in Brest. He faces trial Feb. 24 in a Brest court on a charge of expressing support online for an act of terror, which is punishable by up to 7 years in prison, the Brittany port city's prosecutor said in a statement.",
      "The statement said that during police questioning, the man acknowledged that he was the author of Arabic-language videos on TikTok that called for acts of terror in France and overseas. He told police that the videos targeted opponents of Algeria's government, the statement said.",
      "The arrest of another Algerian, in Grenoble, was announced by the interior minister in a post on X on Friday night. The minister described the man as an influencer and said that \u201che too will have to answer to the courts for vile comments made on TikTok.\u201d",
      "At a court hearing on Monday, the man asked for more time to prepare his defense, Grenoble prosecutor Eric Vaillant said. He faces a charge of inciting an act of terror online, also punishable by 7 years imprisonment, and will be kept in detention until he's tried on March 5, the prosecutor said.",
      "The prosecutor's office in Montpellier didn't immediately respond to emailed questions about the arrest in that city."

      "The French president further cautioned against compromise due to fatigue. \u201cThe credibility of the West will be shattered if we compromise because of fatigue,\u201d he asserted, adding that a capitulation of Ukraine would be catastrophic\u2014not just for Europe, but for U.S. credibility as well.",
      "Macron addressed a range of pressing international issues, identifying Iran as the \u201cprincipal strategic and security challenge\u201d in the Middle East.

      "ROME -- Pope Francis on Monday named the first woman to head a major Vatican office, appointing an Italian nun, Sister Simona Brambilla, to become prefect of the department responsible for all the Catholic Church's religious orders.",
      "The appointment marks a major step in Francis\u2019 aim to give women more leadership roles in governing the church. While women have been named to No. 2 spots in some Vatican offices, never before has a woman been named prefect of a dicastery or congregation of the Holy See Curia, the central governing organ of the Catholic Church.",
      "The historic nature of Brambilla\u2019s appointment was confirmed by Vatican Media, which headlined its report \u201cSister Simona Brambilla is the first woman prefect in the Vatican.\u201d",
      "The office is one of the most important in the Vatican. Known officially as the Dicastery for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, it is responsible for every religious order, from the Jesuits and Franciscans to smaller newer movements.",
      "In an indication of the novelty of the appointment, and the theological implications involved, Francis simultaneously named as a co-leader, or \u201cpro-prefect,\u201d a cardinal: \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez Artime, a Salesian.",
      "But the appointment, announced in the Vatican daily bulletin, lists Brambilla first as \u201cprefect\u201d and Fern\u00e1ndez second as her co-leader, which theologically is necessary since the prefect must be able to celebrate Mass and perform other sacramental functions that currently can only be done by men.",
      "Brambilla, 59, is a member of the Consolata Missionaries religious order and had served as the No. 2 in the religious orders department since last year. She takes over from the retiring Cardinal Joao Braz de Aviz, 77.",
      "Francis made Brambilla\u2019s appointment possible with his 2022 reform of the Holy See\u2019s founding constitution, which allowed laypeople, including women, to head a dicastery and become prefects.",
      "Brambilla, a nurse, worked as a missionary in Mozambique and led her Consolata order as superior from 2011-2023, when Francis made her secretary of the religious orders department.",
      "Her appointment is the latest move by Francis to show by example how women can take leadership roles within the Catholic hierarchy, albeit without allowing them to be ordained as priests.",
      "Catholic women do much of the church\u2019s work in schools, hospitals and passing down the faith to future generations. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men.",
      "Francis has upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons.",
      "But there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women working in the Vatican during his papacy, including in leadership positions, from 19.3% in 2013 to 23.4% today, according to statistics reported by Vatican News. In the Curia alone, the percentage of women is 26%.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned \u201clies and misinformation\u201d that he says are undermining U.K. democracy",
      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday condemned \u201clies and misinformation\u201d that he said are undermining U.K. democracy, in response to a barrage of attacks on his government from Elon Musk.",
      "The billionaire Tesla CEO has taken an intense and erratic interest in British politics since the center-left Labour Party was elected in July. Musk has used his social network, X, to call for a new election and demand Starmer be imprisoned. On Monday he posted an online poll for his 210 million followers on the proposition: \u201cAmerica should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk\u2019s comments during a question session at a hospital near London, Starmer criticized \u201cthose that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible,\u201d particularly opposition Conservative politicians in Britain who have echoed some of Musk\u2019s claims.",
      "Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir -\u2013 shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has \u201ctwo-tier policing\u201d with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators.",
      "Recently Musk has focused on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the \u201cgrooming gangs\u201d out of a fear of appearing racist.",
      "Musk has posted a demand for a public inquiry into the cases. An inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, though many of the recommendations it made in 2022 have yet to be implemented.",
      "Musk also has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England's director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013.",
      "Answering questions after a speech near London, Starmer defended his record as chief prosecutor, saying he had reopened closed cases and \u201cchanged the whole prosecution approach\u201d to child sexual exploitation.",
      "He also condemned language used by Musk about Jess Phillips, a government minister responsible for combating violence against women and girls. Musk called Phillips a \u201crape genocide apologist\u201d and said she deserved to be in prison.",
      "\u201cWhen the poison of the far-right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book, a line has been crossed,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI enjoy the cut and thrust of politics, the robust debate that we must have, but that\u2019s got to be based on facts and truth, not on lies.\u201d",
      "Musk has also called for the release of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right activist who goes by the name Tommy Robinson and is serving a prison sentence for contempt of court.",
      "Starmer said people \"cheerleading Tommy Robinson \u2026 are trying to get some vicarious thrill from street violence that people like Tommy Robinson promote.\u201d",
      "Starmer largely avoided mentioning Musk by name in his responses, likely wary of giving him more of a spotlight \u2014 or of angering Musk ally Donald Trump, who is due to be inaugurated as U.S. president on Jan. 20.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, another target of the X owner's ire, has taken a similar approach. Scholz said he is staying \u201ccool\u201d over critical personal comments made by Musk, but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in a general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.",
      "Starmer said the main issue was not Musk's posts on X, but \u201cwhat are politicians here doing to stand up for our democracy?\u201d",
      "He said he was concerned about Conservative politicians in Britain \u201cso desperate for attention they are amplifying what the far right are saying.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce we lose the anchor that truth matters \u2026 then we are on a very slippery slope,\u201d he said.",
      "While some Conservatives, including party leader Kemi Badenoch, have echoed Musk\u2019s points, the main U.K. beneficiary of his interest has been Reform U.K., the hard-right party led by Nigel Farage that has just five seats in the 650-seat House of Commons but big expansion plans. Farage said last month that Musk was considering making a multimillion-dollar donation to the party.",
      "But Farage is critical of Tommy Robinson, refusing to let him join Reform, and on Sunday Musk posted: \u201cThe Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn\u2019t have what it takes.\u201d",
      "Farage tweeted in response: \u201cWell, this is a surprise! Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree.\u201d",

      "Rinata Fastas said that Israeli forces had raided the local government buildings but had not so far entered residential neighborhoods. Her house lies just inside of the newly blocked-off area in the provincial capital formerly called Baath City, after Assad's former ruling party, and now renamed Salam City.",
      "She said she is afraid Israeli troops may advance farther or try to permanently occupy the area they have already taken. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed. The international community, with the exception of the U.S., regards it as occupied.",
      "Fastas said she understands that Syria, which is now trying to build its national institutions and army from scratch, is no position to militarily confront Israel.",
      "\u201cBut why is no one in the new Syrian state coming out and talking about the violations that are happening in Quneitra province and against the rights of its people?\u201d she asked.",

      "An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the matter, said the military will remain in the area it has taken until it is satisfied that the new Syrian authorities do not pose a danger to Israel.",
      "The new Syrian government has lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israeli airstrikes and advances into Syrian territory.",
      "But the issue does not appear to be a priority for Syria\u2019s new rulers as they try to consolidate control over the country, turn a patchwork of former rebel factions into a new national army, and push for the removal of Western sanctions.",
      "The country\u2019s new de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, head of the former Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has also publicly said Syria is not seeking a military conflict with Israel and will not pose a threat to its neighbors or to the West.",
      "In the meantime, residents of Quneitra have largely been left to fend for themselves.",

      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any weapons, we were just there in the clothes we were wearing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when we got close to them, they started shooting at us.\u201d",
      "Six protesters were wounded, according to residents and media reports. Another man was injured on Dec. 20 in a similar incident in the village of Maariyah. The Israeli army said at the time that it had fired because the man was quickly approaching and ignored calls to stop.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Dec. 25 incident.",
      "Adel Subhi al-Ali, a local Sunni religious official, sat with his 21-year-old son, Moutasem, who was recovering after being shot in the stomach in the Dec. 25 protest. He was driven first to a local hospital that did not have the capacity to treat him, and then to Damascus where he underwent surgery.",
      "When he saw the Israeli tanks moving in, \u201cWe felt that an occupation is occupying our land. So we had to defend it, even though we didn\u2019t have weapons, ... It is impossible for them to settle here,\u201d al-Ali said.",
      "Since the day of the protest, the Israeli army has not returned to the area, he said.",

      "ROME -- Pope Francis wrapped up a busy Christmas season on Monday by calling for the faithful to promote a culture of welcome and integration in their communities and reject discrimination.",
      "Francis presided over Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to mark Epiphany. According to the Bible, the feast marks the day that three wise men guided by a star came to visit the newborn Jesus. Francis said the star, in guiding humanity to God, doesn\u2019t discriminate among ethnic, linguistic or national groups and is there for all.",
      "\u201cWe do well to meditate on this today, in a world in which individuals and nations are equipped with ever more powerful means of communication, and yet seem to have become less willing to understand, accept and encounter others in their diversity!\u201d he said in his homily.",
      "God, he said, calls on Christians to reject anything that discriminates or excludes and discards people. He called instead for promoting \u201ca strong culture of welcome, in which the narrow places of fear and denunciation are replaced by open spaces of encounter, integration and sharing of life; safe spaces where everyone can find warmth and shelter.\u201d",
      "Francis has long preached the Gospel-mandated need to welcome the stranger, applying it to migrants in particular.",
      "The Epiphany Mass marked the end of a particularly busy Christmas season for Francis that also coincided with the start of the 2025 Holy Year. The once-ever-quarter-celebration of Christianity is expected to bring more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome over the next 12 months.",
      "The 88-year-old pope has a daunting schedule ahead greeting and ministering to them, alongside his other papal duties.",
      "And while he is wrapping up the Christmas season with Epiphany, he still has a busy week ahead. He'll deliver his annual foreign policy speech to the Holy See\u2019s diplomatic corps, host a final meeting with President Joe Biden and preside over the baptism of babies in the Sistine Chapel.",

      "VIENNA -- Austrian Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl met the country's president on Monday as expectations mounted that he would be tasked with trying to form a new government, which would be the first led by the far right since World War II.",
      "Kickl's party won Austria's parliamentary election in September, taking 28.8% of the vote and beating outgoing Chancellor Karl Nehammer's conservative Austrian People's Party into second place.",
      "But in October, President Alexander Van der Bellen tasked Nehammer with trying to form a new government after Nehammer's party said it wouldn't go into government with the Freedom Party under Kickl and others refused to work with the Freedom Party at all. Those efforts to form a governing alliance without the far right collapsed in the first few days of the new year and Nehammer said Saturday that he would resign.",
      "The People's Party then signaled that it might be open to working under Kickl. Negotiations between the two aren't guaranteed to succeed, but there are no longer any other realistic coalition options in the current parliament and polls suggest that a new election soon could strengthen the Freedom Party further.",
      "The far right and the conservatives have governed together before, but on previous occasions with the Freedom Party as the junior partner. Most recently, they ran Austria from 2017 to 2019 in a government in which Kickl \u2014 a 56-year-old with a taste for provocation \u2014 served as interior minister. It collapsed in a scandal surrounding the Freedom Party's leader at the time.",
      "In its election program titled \u201cFortress Austria,\u201d the Freedom Party has called for the \u201cremigration of uninvited foreigners,\u201d for achieving a more \u201chomogeneous\u201d nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an emergency law.",
      "The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of Western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany. Kickl has criticized \u201celites\u201d in Brussels and called for some powers to be brought back from the European Union to Austria.",

      "Welby's initial refusal to step aside kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church.",

      "The claim, which drew no response from Ukrainian authorities, came a day after the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces had pressed new attacks in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",
      "The inauguration in two weeks\u2019 time of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has brought a new element of uncertainty and triggered an apparent effort by both sides to establish battlefield gains before any possible peace talks.",

      "In November, The Associated Press reported from the town that some 7,000-10,000 people likely remained in Kurakhove. Its prewar population was about twice that. The town has been under relentless attacks from artillery, multiple rocket launchers, powerful guided bombs and drones that have shattered buildings.",

      "Sarkozy has been under investigation in the case since 2013. He is charged with passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, embezzlement of Libyan public funds and criminal association. The trial is scheduled to run until April 10.",
      "Investigators examined claims that Gadhafi\u2019s government secretly agreed to give Sarkozy up to 50 million euros ($51.6 million) for his 2007 campaign. The sum was more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time, violating French rules.",
      "The investigation gained traction when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros (about $5.1 million) in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff. Takieddine later withdrew the allegation and Sarkozy sought to have the inquiry closed.",
      "After becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to France with high honors later that year. Sarkozy then put France at the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes that helped rebel fighters topple Gadhafi\u2019s government in 2011.",
      "French investigative judges filed preliminary charges in 2023 against Sarkozy for his alleged involvement in an attempt to mislead magistrates in order to clear him in the Libya financing case.",
      "Financial prosecutors said Sarkozy is suspected of \u201cbenefitting from corruptly influencing a witness,\u201d in reference to Takieddine.",
      "Sarkozy\u2019s wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was given preliminary charges in July last year for alleged involvement in efforts to pressure Takieddine. Bruni-Sarkozy was placed under judicial supervision, which includes a ban on contact with all those involved in the proceedings except for her husband.",
      "France\u2019s Court of Cassation on Dec. 18 upheld an appeal court decision that had found Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling while he was the country\u2019s head of state.",
      "Sarkozy has been sentenced to a year in prison but is entitled to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet as provided by French law.",
      "He said he would bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Sarkozy was first found guilty in 2021 by a Paris court, a verdict confirmed in 2023 by an appeals court, for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. The case was revealed through wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya financing investigation.",
      "In February last year, an appeals court in Paris upheld a guilty verdict against Sarkozy for illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid. He was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended.",
      "The former president is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros on the reelection bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande.",
      "Sarkozy has denied all allegations and appealed to the highest Court of Cassation in that case."

      "TOKYO -- A standoff between rival government forces outside the presidential compound in South Korea has been a startling development, even for observers used to the country's famously rough and tumble politics.",
      "For weeks, impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol has remained in his compound and refused to respond to detention and search warrants. Scuffles broke out late last week as dozens of investigators were stopped from entering the compound by hundreds of presidential security guards and a barricade.",
      "The spectacle followed Yoon's astonishing decision last month to impose martial law during a seemingly routine impasse with the opposition, which dominates parliament.",
      "Here's a closer view of recent events as well as South Korea's tempestuous political history, which has seen presidents toppled, arrested, jailed and shamed as millions have taken to the streets in protest.",
      "A government agency dedicated to fighting corruption is asking police to take the lead in efforts to detain Yoon. Agency investigators failed last week to bring Yoon into custody following a standoff with his security service.",
      "The thinking is that the police are better suited to get Yoon out of his compound than the anti-corruption agency, which has faced claims of incompetence after its failure Friday.",
      "Court warrants have been issued to detain Yoon and to search his residence.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team says the agency\u2019s move to get police to execute the detainment warrant is illegal. Yoon has been refusing to appear for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3.",
      "He has described his power grab as a necessary act of governance against a liberal opposition that has bogged down his agenda with its legislative majority. He has vowed to \u201cfight to the end\u201d against efforts to oust him.",
      "Martial law lasted only a few hours, but the country\u2019s politics, diplomacy and financial markets have been shaken for weeks. The decree also exposed South Korea\u2019s deeply polarized society.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers on Monday filed complaints with public prosecutors against the anti-corruption agency\u2019s chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, and six other anti-corruption and police officers for orchestrating Friday\u2019s detainment attempt, which they say was illegal.",
      "Yoon's declaration of martial law unleashed a string of political aftershocks.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, has been weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon declared martial law and dispatched troops to surround parliament. Lawmakers who managed to get past the blockade voted to lift martial law hours later.",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended after parliament voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion. The Constitutional Court has begun deliberations on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.",
      "The agency trying to get Yoon out of his house, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, will likely seek a new court warrant to extend the window for Yoon\u2019s detention. Police say they are reviewing the agency\u2019s request. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the anti-corruption agency would make another attempt to detain Yoon on Monday before the deadline expires at midnight.",
      "About 150 investigators tried to get Yoon on Friday in a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours.",
      "After getting around a military unit guarding the residence\u2019s grounds, the agency\u2019s investigators and police were able to approach within 200 meters (220 yards) of Yoon\u2019s residential building but were stopped by a barricade of around 10 vehicles and approximately 200 members of the presidential security forces and troops.",
      "In a statement, Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, hit back against criticism that his organization has become Yoon\u2019s private army, saying it has a legal obligation to protect the incumbent president.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said they plan to file complaints against about 150 anti-corruption and police investigators who were involved in Friday\u2019s detention attempt.",
      "The why is incredibly tricky.",
      "But a mix of history and geography have something to do with it.",
      "The Koreas have been sandwiched between big powers for millennia, with China, Russia, Japan and the United States all playing parts of a great global game on the peninsula that extends from the east coast of Asia.",
      "South Korea is deeply split, with the divisions reaching into many parts of life, from culture to class to gender to politics.",
      "Much of the deep political divide can be traced to what happened at the end of World War II, when U.S. and Soviet forces met in the middle of the Korean Peninsula and agreed to divide the land into Washington and Moscow-backed spheres of influence. This solidified into independent rival Koreas in 1948 and then exploded into war and permanent division in 1950. After that, South Korea was run by a string of dictators until democracy came in the late 1980s.",
      "Some of the passion evident in South Korean politics can be seen in the turmoil faced by recent presidents, many of whom have been jailed for corruption after leaving office.",
      "A particularly sensational moment came in 2016 when millions protested against conservative President Park Geun-hye, who later became the first democratically elected leader to be forced from office since South Korea turned democratic.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- A shooting attack on a bus carrying Israelis in the occupied West Bank killed at least three people and wounded seven others on Monday, Israeli medics said.",
      "Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said those killed included two women in their 60s and a man in his 40s.",
      "Violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the ongoing war there.",
      "The attack occurred in the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq, on one of the main east-west roads crossing the territory. The identities of the attackers and those killed were not immediately known. The military said it was looking for the attackers, who fled.",
      "Palestinians have carried out scores of shooting, stabbing and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years. Israel has launched near-nightly military raids across the territory that frequently trigger gunbattle with militants.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 835 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.",
      "Some 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority administering population centers. Over 500,000 Israeli settlers live in scores of settlements, which most of the international community considers illegal.",
      "Meanwhile, the war in Gaza is raging with no end in sight, though there has reportedly been recent progress in long-running talks aimed at a ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in a massive surprise attack nearly 15 months ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel's air and ground offensive has killed over 45,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of those killed. They do not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the territory's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are enduring a cold, rainy winter in tent camps along the windy coast. At least seven infants have died of hypothermia because of the harsh conditions, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Aid groups say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order in many areas make it difficult to provide desperately needed food and other assistance.",

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday set maximum levels for lead in baby foods like jarred fruits and vegetables, yogurts and dry cereal, part of an effort to cut young kids' exposure to the toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological problems.",
      "The agency issued final guidance that it estimated could reduce lead exposure from processed baby foods by about 20% to 30%. The limits are voluntary, not mandatory, for food manufacturers, but they allow the FDA to take enforcement action if foods exceed the levels.",
      "It's part of the FDA's ongoing effort to \u201creduce dietary exposure to contaminants, including lead, in foods to as low as possible over time, while maintaining access to nutritious foods,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Consumer advocates, who have long sought limits on lead in children's foods, welcomed the guidance first proposed two years ago, but said it didn't go far enough.",
      "\u201cFDA's actions today are a step forward and will help protect children,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cHowever, the agency took too long to act and ignored important public input that could have strengthened these standards.\u201d",
      "The new limits on lead for children younger than 2 don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, which some research has shown contain higher levels of lead. And they don't limit other metals such as cadmium that have been detected in baby foods.",
      "Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, called the limits \"virtually meaningless because they\u2019re based more on industry feasibility and not on what would best protect public health.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for baby food maker Gerber said the company's products meet the limits.",
      "There\u2019s no safe level of lead exposure for children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The metal causes \u201cwell-documented health effects,\u201d including brain and nervous system damage and slowed growth and development. However, lead occurs naturally in some foods and comes from pollutants in air, water and soil, which can make it impossible to eliminate entirely.",
      "The FDA guidance sets a lead limit of 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals. The guidance covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes.",
      "The new guidance comes more than a year after lead-tainted pouches of apple cinnamon puree sickened more than 560 children in the U.S. between October 2023 and April 2024, according to the CDC.",
      "The levels of lead detected in those products were more than 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum. Officials stressed that the agency doesn't need guidance to take action on foods that violate the law.",

A spokesperson for Vanderbilt said the company was reviewing the CFPB lawsuit Monday but didn't immediately comment. Clayton also didn't immediately respond. Both Vanderbilt and Clayton are based in Tennessee.",
      "A decade ago, Clayton was accused of predatory lending in a series of news articles, but Buffett defended Clayton's lending practices and said the company followed all state and federal laws.",
      "After the 2008 financial crisis that was triggered by systemic failures in the mortgage market all lenders were required to verify borrowers\u2019 incomes and make a good-faith determination about whether they will be able to replay a loan.",
      "The CFPB said in the lawsuit that Vanderbilt failed to do that and at times manipulated its lending standards when borrowers didn\u2019t have enough income or relied on unrealistic estimates of living expenses.",
      "In addition to manufactured housing companies Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns a broad assortment of companies, including other manufacturers, several major utilities, huge insurers like Geico, the BNSF railroad and some of the best-known retail brands including Dairy Queen and Helzberg Diamonds."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs.",
      "Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis.",
      "The bill rescinds two provisions \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset \u2014 that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government.",
      "The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025.

The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",

      "The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner \"shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account\u201d changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action.",

      "The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change.",
      "\u201cNow firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,\" Kelly said.",
      "Sherrod Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy.",
      "\u201cOver two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 09:32:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees."

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election, kicked off a tour of Latin America on Saturday, just days before President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is set to be sworn in for a third term in defiance of international pressure.",
      "A crowd of a few hundred Venezuelan migrants broke into shouts of \u201cEdmundo, Presidente\u201d as Gonz\u00e1lez emerged from a meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei to wave to supporters from the balcony of the iconic Casa Rosada, or Pink House, in Buenos Aires.",
      "\u201cWe are doing whatever the cause of freedom requires,\u201d Milei, an effusive far-right supporter of the Venezuelan opposition, said as he welcomed Gonz\u00e1lez to the presidential palace with honors normally reserved for a head of state.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a retired diplomat, fled into exile in Spain in September after a judge issued an arrest warrant following the July 28 presidential election, in which Maduro was declared the winner by the National Electoral Council, which is stacked with governing party loyalists.",
      "In recent weeks, he has been vowing to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term, which according to law must begin on Jan. 10. But he hasn't said how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military.",
      "On Thursday, Maduro\u2019s government raised the stakes even further, announcing a $100,000 reward for information on Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s whereabouts and plastering the wanted-like bulletin with the retired diplomat's photo on social media and the arrivals board at the country's main airport.",
      "Upon arrival to the Argentine capital, where he twice served as Venezuela\u2019s ambassador more than two decades ago, Gonz\u00e1lez posted on social media a short video message expressing solidarity with those imprisoned in Venezuela as part of a crackdown by Maduro.",
      "He said that he would raise with Milei concerns about the well-being of five Maduro opponents who have been sheltering in the Argentine ambassador\u2019s residence in Caracas for nearly 10 months \u2014 a diplomatic standoff that has embittered relations between Venezuela and Argentina.",
      "The Biden administration and most European governments have rejected the election's official results, pointing out that authorities didn't provide detailed results as they have in past elections. Meanwhile, copies of tally sheets collected by the opposition from 85% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines show that Gonz\u00e1lez prevailed by a more than two-to-one margin.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 75, was a previously unknown career diplomat when he was thrust into rallying the anti-Maduro coalition as a last-minute stand-in for opposition stalwart Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, whom the government banned from running for office.",
      "After speaking with Milei on Saturday, Gonz\u00e1lez is scheduled to cross the Rio de la Plata for a meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou."

      "The World Wrestling Entertainment executive said during earning calls in the past that he saw a day when Netflix would continue to evolve and enter into live programming, much to the consternation of Netflix officials.",
      "However, Khan saw the hires that Netflix was making along with the streaming service's offerings that could appeal to all family members.",
      "Now, one of those offerings is the WWE.",
      "The 1,650th episode of \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d from the Intuit Dome outside of Los Angeles officially kicks off WWE's 10-year partnership with Netflix. The agreement, reached last January, is worth in excess of $5 billion with an option for Netflix to extend for an additional 10 years or opt out after five.",
      "\u201cWe try to appeal the WWE to all 50 states and to countries globally. We think Netflix does the same thing,\" said Khan, who is WWE\u2019s president.",
      "Netflix \u2014 which has 282.3 million subscribers in more than 190 countries \u2014 becomes the exclusive home of \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America, with additional countries to be added over time. The bigger component for Netflix though, is that the streaming platform will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas \u2014 including \u201cSmackdown\u201d and \u201cNXT\u201d \u2014 as well as premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "In the U.S., \u201cSmackdown\u201d moved to USA Network from Fox and \u201cNXT\u201d from USA to the CW three months ago. Peacock has a contract to carry WWE's premium live events through March 2026.",
      "\u201cRaw\u201d began airing on Jan. 11, 1993, and is the longest running weekly episodic series on television. Most of that time had been on USA Network with a run on Spike TV, now known as Paramount Network.",
      "\u201cIt has great storytelling, characters along with memorable and surprising stories. And the idea of combining this kind of intense fandom with these characters and our reach globally just seemed like such a great opportunity,\u201d said Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. \u201cWhat we also love is the multigenerational fan base. At the end of the day, we have great things that our members love and this totally delivers on all of the things that we want. And to do it 52 weeks a year is super exciting.\"",
      "WWE's global reach has expanded during the past year, with nearly half of its premium live events taking place overseas. The company will also embark on an extended tour of Europe in March to build momentum for WrestleMania 41, which takes place in Las Vegas April 19 and 20.",
      "Khan said WWE first approached Netflix about its rights in 2018, but Netflix wasn't ready to begin carrying live events. The streaming service has ramped up its efforts during the past year, not only with sports events, but with Chris Rock's comedy special and the roast of Tom Brady.",
      "Brandon Riegg, Netflix\u2019s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the social media buzz around \u201cRaw\u201d each week as well as the stable audience WWE provides made it a natural fit this time when the company approached Netflix last year.",
      "In turn, Riegg thinks Netflix can help expand WWE's audience the way it did with Formula 1 and the \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d series.",
      "\u201cIt really was just fitting in to the whole picture of we\u2019re going to do these big events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the NFL on Christmas,\" he said. \"But then throughout the year, if we can have a steady drumbeat of those amazing live moments and live action and spectacle, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to get with WWE.\u201d",
      "According to Nielsen, \u201cRaw's\u201d final episode on USA Network averaged 1.6 million viewers despite going against the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Khan and WWE chief content officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque have also stressed that the three-hour weekly show will not hurt its rating due to being on a streaming platform. \u201cRaw\u201d was known for toeing the line on risky content during the late 1990s in what WWE called the \u201cAttitude Era,\u201d but that has changed over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not pushing anybody away of what they want. It\u2019s a safe place for families and everybody to be able to view. That will not change, but you don\u2019t have to change that to expand and improve what you do,\u201d Levesque said.",
      "WWE's storytelling and character development continues to excel even during external challenges. Former chairman Vince McMahon resigned last January after a lawsuit claiming sexual misconduct. In 2023, WWE was bought by Endeavor and merged with Ultimate Fighting Championship to create TKO Group Holdings.",
      "According to WWE, there were 44 sellouts for TV shows and 66 overall, including house shows and premium live events, in 2024.",
      "WWE champion Cody Rhodes credited Khan and Levesque for keeping the company on track, along with scaling back on some of the non-televised live events to make sure top talent does not get burned out during the year.",
      "Levesque said Monday's show will be on the level of a premium live event. John Cena, who is retiring from WWE at the end of the year, begins his farewell tour with three main event matches on tap. It also wouldn't be a shock if Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson makes an appearance.",
      "Roman Reigns, who will take part in one of the main event matches, said he is always trying to put his best foot forward, but he also knows how big Monday night is for the company.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no hiding that this is Netflix and this is huge and this is going to be on a global platform with a lot of people watching. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that audience is going to look like. It\u2019s going to be crazy, I know that.\"",

      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused over several decades by climate change.",
      "The federal lawsuit filed Monday asks a state court to prevent Vermont from enforcing the law, which was passed last year. Vermont became the first state in the country to enact the law after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather. The state is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to Jan. 1, 1995.",
      "The lawsuit argues the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. It also argues that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating \u201cagainst the important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.\u201d",
      "The Chamber and the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, the American Petroleum Institute, argue that the federal government is already addressing climate change. And because greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, they argue it is impossible to measure \u201caccurately and fairly\u201d the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over decades.",
      "\u201cVermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,\" said Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber\u2019s litigation center. \u201cThat is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 one state can\u2019t try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont\u2019s penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the state's Agency of Natural Resources said it had not been formally served with this lawsuit.",
      "Anthony Iarrapino, a Vermont-based lobbyist with the Conservation Law Foundation, said the lawsuit was the fossil fuel industry's way of \u201ctrying to avoid accountability for the damage their products have caused in Vermont and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore states are following Vermont\u2019s lead holding Big Oil accountable for the disaster recovery and cleanup costs from severe storms fueled by climate change, ensuring that families and businesses no longer have to foot the entire bill time and time again,\" Iarrapino added.",
      "Under the law, the Vermont state treasurer, in consultation with the Agency of Natural Resources, is to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2026, on the total cost to Vermonters and the state from the emission of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1, 1995, to Dec. 31, 2024. The assessment would look at the effects on public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development, housing and other areas. The state would use federal data to determine the amount of covered greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a fossil fuel company.",
      "It\u2019s a polluter-pays model affecting companies engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or refining crude oil attributable to more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during the time period. The funds could be used by the state for such things as improving stormwater drainage systems; upgrading roads, bridges and railroads; relocating, elevating or retrofitting sewage treatment plants; and making energy efficient weatherization upgrades to public and private buildings. It\u2019s modeled after the federal Superfund pollution cleanup program.",
      "The approach taken by Vermont has drawn interest from other states, including New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a similar bill in December.",
      "The New York law requires companies responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to pay into a state fund for infrastructure projects meant to repair or avoid future damage from climate change. The biggest emitters of greenhouse gases between 2000 and 2018 would be subjected to the fines."

      "This marked the third straight five-year period the teams took their dispute to the RSDC. The decision became public when the Nationals filed a petition asking for the New York Supreme Court to confirm the award. The filing of the petition was first reported by The Sun in Baltimore.",
      "Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer representing the Orioles, and Patrick Curran, a lawyer representing the Nationals, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Litigation over 2012-16 rights fees resulted in a 2019 RSDC decision by Attanasio, Seattle Mariners president Kevin Mather and Toronto Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro valuing them at $296.8 million. After arguments that went to the New York Court of Appeals, the sides agreed to a settlement in June 2023.",
      "A RSDC decision on Nov. 8, 2023, by Attanasio, Montfort and Werner said Washington was owed about $304.1 million by MASN for 2017-21, after an adjustment downward of almost $45.5 million for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. That decision was confirmed by New York Supreme Court Justice Andrew Borrok the following month.",
      "MASN was established in March 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals, moving into what had been Baltimore\u2019s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972.",
      "The Orioles were given a supermajority partnership interest in MASN, starting at 90%, and Washington made a $75 million payment to the network for an initial 10% stake.",

The deal called for the Nationals\u2019 equity to increase 1% annually, starting after the 2009 season, with a cap of 33%.",

      "JetBlue said the government, which operates the air traffic control system, shares the blame for late flights.",
      "Airline spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said JetBlue has invested \u201ctens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays, particularly related to ongoing air traffic control challenges in our largest markets in the Northeast and Florida,\u201d resulting in better on-time performance in 2024, including during the peak summer travel season.",
      "\u201cWhile we\u2019ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation\u2019s air traffic control system,\u201d Dombrowski said. He said the incoming Trump administration should prioritize modernizing \u201coutdated\u201d air traffic control technology and understaffing of controllers, who are hired by the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Transportation Department regulations prohibit airlines from publishing schedules that don\u2019t reflect real departure and arrival times. The agency defines a flight as chronically delayed if it runs at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than half the time.",
      "The department cited JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. It said it warned JetBlue about frequent delays on flights between New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Frequent delays also occurred on flights between JFK and Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida, and between Windsor Locks, Connecticut and Fort Lauderdale.",

      "Mike Whitaker, chief of the Federal Aviation Administration, said in an online post Friday that his agency also has more work to do in its oversight of Boeing.",
      "Whitaker, who plans to step down in two weeks to let President-elect Donald Trump pick his own FAA administrator, looked back on his decision last January to ground all 737 Max jets with similar panels called door plugs. Later, the FAA put more inspectors in Boeing factories, limited production of new 737s, and required Boeing to come up with a plan to fix manufacturing problems.",
      "\u201cBoeing is working to make progress executing its comprehensive plan in the areas of safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cBut this is not a one-year project. What\u2019s needed is a fundamental cultural shift at Boeing that\u2019s oriented around safety and quality above profits. That will require sustained effort and commitment from Boeing, and unwavering scrutiny on our part.\u201d",
      "Boeing on Friday issued an update on steps it has taken to improve safety and quality, including addressing concerns raised by employees and reinforcing their confidentiality protection.",
      "Boeing, which couldn\u2019t build new 737s during a seven-week strike by machinists last fall, said it has strengthened training for mechanics and quality inspectors. The company said it updated a system to display the names of employees who perform metal-stamping work.",

      "New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has already taken several actions to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene",
      "ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein took several actions on Thursday to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene, with an immediate focus on more temporary housing and repairs to private bridges and roads.",
      "Stein, who took his oath of office on Wednesday to succeed fellow Democrat Roy Cooper, traveled to Asheville and \u2014 with legislators and officials from both parties behind him \u2014 announced he had signed five executive orders related to the historic flooding in late September in western North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe needs facing this region are vast and require immediate attention,\u201d Stein said at a news conference. \u201cI pledge to do everything in my power as governor to accelerate recovery of the rebuilding of a more resilient region for the long haul.\u201d",
      "Over 100 people died in North Carolina because of Helene, which state officials estimate caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Billions of dollars from the federal and state government already have been spent or earmarked for the recovery, and Congress last month committed at least another $9 billion in aid. But more must be done this winter to put more people in warm and safe housing on their own property, and to restore vital transportation links between small communities as well as first responders and school buses, Stein said.",
      "One executive order allows the state Department of Public Safety to purchase up to 1,000 temporary housing units through the end of next month without going through the usual state procurement and bidding processes. Stein said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the costs of these units. FEMA is already following another regulatory process as it installs similar trailers on its own, he added.",
      "Stein also delegated to the Division of Emergency Management the ability to hire repair contractors for private bridges and roads without procurement requirements. It also lets environmental regulators waive rules to speed up permitting and inspections.",
      "More than 12,000 western North Carolinians are displaced from their homes due to Helene, which also caused significant damage to more than 8,000 private roads and bridges, Stein's orders said.",
      "\u201cWhen I have met with affected folks here in the mountains, the need for housing assistance and the repairing of private bridges and roads has come up in nearly every conversation,\" he said. \u201cWestern North Carolina \u2014 I want you to know that I hear you.\u201d",
      "Another Stein order creates a new Governor\u2019s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina and establishes within the Commerce Department a Division of Community Revitalization that in part will oversee the rebuilding of homes destroyed or damaged by Helene.",
      "The North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which was created during Cooper's administration, will stick to rebuilding homes in eastern North Carolina harmed by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, Stein said. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly have been angry with the pace of the agency's work and a fiscal shortfall for ongoing housing projects.",
      "Stein also issued an order giving many state employees more paid leave this year to volunteer for Helene-related recovery efforts, and he agreed to continue a Helene recovery advisory committee that he created after his November election victory. GOP state Sen. Kevin Corbin, who has co-chaired the panel with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, said Thursday that Stein's actions were \u201cbipartisan commonsense solutions.\"",
      "New State Auditor Dave Boliek, also a Republican, released a statement later Thursday telling Stein that his department would hold Stein's office accountable on how money stemming from the orders gets spent.",
      "\u201cGiven past failures to effectively provide hurricane relief to Eastern North Carolina, it is in the best interest of Hurricane Helene victims that our office takes such action,\" Boliek said."

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n was sworn in Thursday as Puerto Rico\u2019s new governor during a normally ebullient ceremony held amid widespread anger over a blackout that hit the U.S. territory days ago.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a Republican who backs President-elect Donald Trump and whose pro-statehood New Progressive Party secured a historic third consecutive term after she won the Nov. 5 election, has pledged to stabilize the Caribbean island\u2019s crumbling power grid.",
      "\u201cThere are many challenges facing our island,\u201d she said in her first public address as governor as she acknowledged the blackout in a speech to a crowd gathered in front of the seaside Capitol. \u201cThat is precisely what moves me to address that first challenge with a sense of urgency.\u201d",
      "She pledged to improve Puerto Rico's infrastructure, hospitals and schools, adding that she intends to boost bilingual education.",
      "\u201cI'm going to fulfill my promises to you,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not going to govern only for those who voted for me. I am going to be the governor of all Puerto Ricans.\u201d",
      "Before the start of a ceremony to celebrate her swearing in, Gonz\u00e1lez attended Mass surrounded by family and supporters.",
      "\u201cWhat better than to come first to thank God and to ask God to give me the wisdom, the fortitude and the tools to fulfill everything I promised the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "A protester with her face covered interrupted the Mass at Parroquia Santa Teresita in San Juan. She yelled, \u201cJenniffer, we came for you! Puerto is without power.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a small group of protesters gathered at the Capitol before Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s arrival. They were especially rankled that a well-known, outspoken activist elected to Puerto Rico's Senate for the first time was not allowed inside the Capitol, with the elections commission noting he had not yet been officially certified.",
      "Protesting the ceremony was Yara Humar\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, an aquatic physical therapist whose 83-year-old mother remains without power.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any hope that she will change anything,\u201d she said of the new governor.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez has promised to appoint an energy \u201cczar\u201d to review potential contractual breaches while another operator is found to possibly replace Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico.",
      "However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval from Puerto Rico\u2019s Energy Bureau and a federal control board that oversees the island\u2019s finances.",
      "Outages were still being reported on Thursday as crews tried to stabilize the grid following the blackout that hit early Tuesday, leaving 1.3 million customers in the dark as Puerto Ricans prepared for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "While electricity had been restored to 99% of the utility's 1.47 million total customers, more than 600,000 were temporarily left without power on New Year\u2019s Day when part of the system collapsed again, according to Luma.",
      "\u201cThe stability of the system is fragile,\u201d Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. \u201cWe know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.\u201d",
      "Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform.",
      "The anticipated revelry was characteristic of Gonz\u00e1lez, a 48-year-old attorney and recent mother of twins who prior to the election showed up at her party\u2019s assembly wearing a Wonder Woman tiara and cuffs. She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Supporters and critics gathered for the ceremony, some clutching umbrellas to shield themselves from the blistering sun.",
      "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s going to be a great governor,\u201d said Amanda S\u00e1nchez Le\u00f3n, a retired government employee, who arrived two hours early to secure a spot outside an area reserved for guests. She said she was hopeful that Gonz\u00e1lez would reduce violent crimes and improve education and health, \u201cespecially for us older people.\u201d She also believed the power crisis would improve and that Gonz\u00e1lez would see her promises through.",
      "\u201cThe people are suffering,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Also supporting the new governor was Lizbeth Rodr\u00edguez, a school nurse, who believed that as a mother, Gonz\u00e1lez would prioritize the island\u2019s weak education system and tackle crime.",
      "But Rodr\u00edguez remains rankled at what she believes is the misspending of government money.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what bothers the people. You\u2019re doing fine, sure, but look at us,\u201d she said.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party\u2019s primary in June.",
      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",
      "After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",
      "While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections, and officials with the New Progressive Party have noted the island receives unequal treatment when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal programs.",
      "\u201cStatehood means equality, and I want us to have that access to opportunities,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI want to have those opportunities here so that our people can move forward.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 08:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",

      "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Opponents of the nation's largest lithium mine under construction want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project in Nevada already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail being considered for endangered species protection.",
      "Environmentalists and Native American activists are demanding that the U.S. Interior Department address what they say is new evidence that bolsters their concerns about Lithium Americas\u2019 planned open pit mine at Thacker Pass. The footprint of mine operations will span about 9 square miles (23 square kilometers).",
      "The fate of the snail takes center stage after a federal judge and an appeals court dismissed a previous attempt by Native American tribes to get federal agencies to recognize the sacred nature of the area. The tribes argued that the mine would infringe on lands where U.S. troops massacred dozens of their ancestors in 1865.",
      "Now, Western Watersheds Project and the group known as People of Red Mountain argue in a notice of intent to sue that the government and Canada-based Lithium Americas are failing to live up to promises to adequately monitor groundwater impacts.",
      "They say it\u2019s alarming that an analysis of groundwater data from a nearby well that was conducted by Payton Gardner, an assistant professor of hydrogeology at the University of Montana, shows a drop in the water table of nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) since 2018. Nevada regulators say they have no information so far that would confirm declining levels but have vowed to monitor the situation during the mine's lifespan.",
      "Not much bigger than a grain of rice, the Kings River pyrg has managed to survive in 13 isolated springs within the basin surrounding the mine site. It\u2019s the only place in the world where the snail lives.",
      "In some cases, the tiny creatures require only a few centimeters of water. But the margin for survival becomes more narrow if the groundwater system that feeds the springs begins to drop, said Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project.",
      "\u201cEven slight disruptions to its habitat could cause springs to run dry, driving it to extinction,\u201d he said.",
      "Western Watersheds Project and the other opponents say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to rule in a timely fashion on a 2022 petition to list the snail as threatened or endangered. The allegations outlined in the opponents' notice follow requests for federal biologists to investigate whether groundwater drawdowns are being caused by exploratory drilling and other activities and whether there have been impacts to the springs.",
      "Without protection, Ruprecht fears the snail \u201cwill become another casualty of the lithium boom.\u201d",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a review of the snail's status, but the agency declined to comment on the requests for an investigation into the groundwater concerns.",
      "Efforts to mine gold and other minerals in Nevada and other parts of the West over the decades have spurred plenty of legal skirmishes over potential threats to wildlife and water supplies. Lithium is no exception, as demand for the metal critical to making batteries for electric vehicles is expected to continue to climb exponentially over the next decade.",
      "President Joe Biden made increased production of electric vehicles central to his energy agenda, and the U.S. Energy Department last year agreed to loan Lithium Americas more than $2 billion to help finance construction at Thacker Pass. On Dec. 23, Lithium Americas announced it had concluded a joint venture with General Motors Holdings LLC to develop and operate the mine.",
      "The mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Reno is the biggest in the works and closest to fruition in the U.S., followed by Ioneer\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge project near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "And the Bureau of Land Management announced in late December that it was seeking comments on another proposed project in northeastern Nevada. Surge Battery Metals USA wants to explore for lithium in Elko County.",
      "Ruprecht said reports filed by Lithium Americas\u2019 environmental consultant with state regulators show the company no longer has permission to access private lands where several monitoring wells are located. That makes it harder to tell if flows have been impacted by past drilling, he said.",
      "Nevada regulators say they approved changes in 2024 to the monitoring plan to account for the loss of access to wells on private land.",
      "Prior data showed groundwater levels had remained stable from the 1960s to 2018. Construction started at the site in 2023.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the mine acknowledged some reduction in groundwater levels were possible but not for decades, and most likely would occur only if state regulators granted the company permission to dig below the water table.",
      "Lithium Americas spokesman Tim Crowley said it appears the mine\u2019s opponents are \u201cworking to re-spin issues that have previously been addressed and resolved in court.\u201d He pointed to 10 years of data collection by the company indicating the snail would not be affected by the project."

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- After some uncertainty, the Tampa Bay Rays now support a $55.7 million city plan to repair hurricane-shredded Tropicana Field in time for the 2026 season opener, while the team prepares to play this year at the New York Yankees' spring training home in nearby Tampa.",
      "Matt Silverman, the Rays' co-president, said in an email to the St. Petersburg chief administrator that the team wants to \u201cclear up\u201d any questions about its support for the reconstruction. The city must pay for the work under its current contract with the Rays.",
      "\u201cWhile we had been open to considering a scenario in which the city bought out of its obligation to rebuild the ballpark, the Rays support and expect the city to rebuild Tropicana Field in accordance with the terms of the current use agreement,\u201d Silverman wrote.",
      "Hurricane Milton tore the Trop's fabric roof to pieces when it came ashore Oct. 9, causing water and other damage to interior parts of the now-exposed ballpark. Work has been ongoing to ensure no further damage is caused by weather but there had been questions about the full repair in part because it would eventually be torn down to make way for a new, $1.3 billion ballpark under current plans to keep the Rays in St. Petersburg another 30 years.",
      "Time is of the essence, Silverman said in his Dec. 30 email to the city, which released it Monday. Even a partial 2026 season at Tropicana Field \u201cwould present massive logistical and revenue challenges for the team,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt is therefore critical that the rebuild start in earnest as soon as possible\" with a realistic construction schedule to be ready by opening day 2026, he added.",
      "The city had no immediate comment on the email. Its own architect presented the repair proposal initially on Dec. 12 but it has not yet been fully approved. Members of the city council have balked at the cost, especially with residents and businesses still recovering from Milton and Hurricane Helene before that.",
      "St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch has said that insurance and Federal Emergency Management Agency funds should cover the bulk of the cost. Silverman said Major League Baseball has told the team it will hire its own advisor to monitor the repair work and timeline.",
      "The planned new downtown Rays ballpark is part of a $6.5 billion project that will include affordable housing, a Black history museum, retail and office space, restaurants and bars. The project is known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which was once a thriving Black community displaced by the construction of the ballpark and an interstate highway.",
      "The Rays are preparing to play 2025 home games at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees' 11,000-seat spring training location in Tampa. Once Tropicana Field is repaired, Silverman acknowledged the Rays are obligated to play there three more seasons under the contract with St. Petersburg.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to a grand reopening,\u201d Silverman said.",

      "Novak Djokovic says he still feels a bit of trauma when he travels to Australia",
      "Novak Djokovic said he still feels \u201ca bit of trauma\u201d when he travels to Australia, stemming from his deportation in 2022 because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "\u201cThe last couple of times that I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration, I had a bit of trauma from three years ago,\" Djokovic said in an interview with Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper published Monday, ahead of the Australian Open. \u201cAnd some traces still stay there when I\u2019m passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is approaching.\u201d",
      "Djokovic, who has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam championships at Melbourne Park, continued: \u201cThe person checking my passport \u2014 are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go? I must admit I have that feeling.\u201d",
      "Back in 2022, Djokovic sought, and initially obtained, an exemption that would allow him into the Australian Open \u2014 and the country \u2014 even though there were strict rules requiring shots to protect against the coronavirus. But after his flight landed, he was detained at the airport, his visa was canceled and he was sent to an immigration hotel.",
      "A judge later reinstated the visa and ordered Djokovic\u2019s release, ruling he wasn\u2019t given enough time to speak to his lawyers. Australia\u2019s immigration minister then took away the visa again, based on \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Djokovic\u2019s appeal of that ruling was denied by a three-judge panel, and he was deported. He faced a possible three-year ban from the country as someone whose visa was revoked, but Australia had a change of government, its pandemic border rules changed and a new immigration minister granted Djokovic a visa in 2023 \u2014 when he went on to claim the trophy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hold any resentment, to be honest,\u201d Djokovic told the Herald Sun about the saga. \u201cI don\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d",
      "The Australian Open begins Sunday (Saturday EST), and Djokovic will be pursuing his 11th trophy in Melbourne to add to his men's record and an unprecedented 25th major singles title overall.",
      "A year ago, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Jannik Sinner.",
      "\u201cI just hope to, before I retire, get at least one more title there,\" said the 37-year-old Djokovic, whose only triumph at a tournament in 2024 was his singles gold medal for Serbia at the Paris Olympics in August.",
      "Djokovic opened 2025 at the Brisbane International last week, losing in the quarterfinals to Reilly Opelka.",
      "At the Australian Open, Djokovic will be playing in his first event alongside new coach Andy Murray, his former on-court rival and a three-time major champion who retired as a player after the Summer Games. Murray and Djokovic have said they will partner up through the year's initial Grand Slam tournament.",

      "Doug Pederson is out as Jacksonville\u2019s head coach after the franchise\u2019s \u201cbest team assembled\u201d won just four games",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Pederson and general manager Trent Baalke never developed enough synergy, if any at all.",
      "Pederson thought talent was Jacksonville's bigger issue as losses mounted; Baalke believed coaching was the problem. Regardless, the pairing wasn't working in Year 3 \u2014 and everyone inside the building knew it.",
      "Jaguars owner Shad Khan could have justified a complete overhaul. Instead, the billionaire businessman settled for choosing between the duo. He opted for Baalke, a questionable decision that could affect who becomes Jacksonville\u2019s next head coach.",
      "Khan fired Pederson on Monday, a day after a 26-23 overtime loss at Indianapolis. It was the team\u2019s 18th loss in its last 23 games. More surprising, he kept Baalke.",
      "Khan made the move with one year remaining on Pederson\u2019s contract and more than five months after the owner stood in front of coaches and players and declared this the \u201cbest team assembled by the Jacksonville Jaguars ever.\"",
      "\u201cWinning now\u201d was Khan\u2019s edict as training camp opened and after he committed nearly half a billion dollars to signing quarterback Trevor Lawrence, pass rusher Josh Hines-Allen and cornerback Tyson Campbell to long-term deals in the offseason. It was the most expensive stretch of roster building in franchise history.",
      "And Khan has gotten little return on his investment.",
      "\u201cAs much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better, I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans, who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded,\u201d Khan said in a statement. \"In that spirit, the time to summon new leadership is now.",
      "\u201cI strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago.\"",
      "Pederson, who led the Eagles to their first Super Bowl title in 2018, finished 9-8 in his first two campaigns in Jacksonville and made the playoffs in his first year. He became the first coach in franchise history to start with back-to-back winning seasons and was a welcome relief following Urban Meyer\u2019s 13-game tenure that was filled with dysfunction.",
      "But Pederson\u2019s injury-riddled team went 1-5 down the stretch in 2023 and missed the postseason after spending nearly two months atop the AFC South. He thought getting Lawrence healthy and revamping his defensive staff would change the team\u2019s fortunes. Neither made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt's unfortunate because at the end of the day we all had a hand in it,\u201d receiver Christian Kirk said. \u201cI have a ton of respect for Doug. He\u2019s made me a better football player, better man. I think he\u2019s one of the better coaches to have coached in this league, and it\u2019s just unfortunate the way that things went.\u201d",
      "More damning: Pederson failed to develop Lawrence or create a team identity, handed play-calling duties to Press Taylor despite Khan making his wishes known and showed no urgency to try to fix a defense that regressed under new coordinator Ryan Nielsen.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of factors that have gone into our season,\u201d tight end Evan Engram said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the coaching. It's not just one part of it. It's everybody. I\u2019ve been in this league for a while. I try not to get into the whole that side of it, so definitely it\u2019s always unfortunate when most changes do come.\u201d",
      "The Jaguars (4-13) finished with their 10th losing season in Khan\u2019s 13 years as owner. Now, Khan will hire his sixth head coach; current NFL offensive coordinators Ben Johnson (Detroit) and Liam Coen (Tampa Bay) should top the list. But would they even agree to work with Baalke, whose draft picks have been mostly suspect and his latest free-agent class is among the worst in franchise history?",
      "The 56-year-old Pederson went 23-30 with Jacksonville, a far cry from the Super Bowl-winning coach Khan thought he hired in February 2021.",
      "His tenure with Jacksonville was mostly forgettable. Sure, there was the come-from-behind stunner over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC wild-card round in January 2023 in which Lawrence rallied the Jaguars from a 27-0 deficit and won 31-30. Otherwise, Pederson was fairly pedestrian.",
      "His ultimate undoing came in close games, with Jacksonville going 3-10 in one-score contests this season. Whether that\u2019s talent or coaching is debatable. Regardless, Pederson got little public support from players down the stretch, a clear sign that the locker room was ready for a different direction.",
      "Now Khan has to find the right coach to get Lawrence \u2014 and the rest of the team \u2014 to another level. It also will have to be someone amenable to working with Baalke, whose coaching list includes Jim Harbaugh (2011-14), Jim Tomsula (2015), Chip Kelly (2022), Meyer (2021) and Pederson (2022-24).",

    "title": "Jimmy Butler wants to leave the Heat. Pat Riley has been in this spot many times before",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 12:26:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months",
    "story": [
      "Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months",
      "MIAMI -- Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months. The Miami Heat president has not revealed any retirement timetable. He still wears impeccable suits, shakes hands with as firm of a grip as anyone, knows all eyes are on him when he walks into just about any room.",
      "He's not stopping. Or changing.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a rock. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s the Godfather,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last month. \"That\u2019s why we all kill ourselves for this culture. It's because of him. We believe in him.\u201d",
      "And, as some have learned over the years, clashing with Riley doesn't always end well.",
      "Jimmy Butler's in-progress breakup with the Heat \u2014 Miami didn't give him an extension, Butler wants a trade, the franchise suspended him for seven games for conduct detrimental to the team, and here we are \u2014 is not the first time that a superstar has been in Miami but had his time with Riley's team come to an unceremonious end.",
      "Dwyane Wade left (but returned). LeBron James left. Shaquille O'Neal got traded. All of those situations \u2014 and Butler's, as well \u2014 are different in plenty of ways. But the parallel in them in that Riley will only do what he thinks is best for the Heat.",
      "\u201cI know from personal experience,\u201d O\u2019Neal said in his role as an analyst on TNT last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t bicker with Pat Riley.\u201d",
      "A look at those situations:",
      "How they got here: Butler was eligible for a $113 million, two-year extension last summer. The Heat didn't offer it, so this dispute is largely about money.",
      "There's more to it, of course.",
      "Butler is not an easy guy to deal with, which is not a knock on him nor is it a bad thing. He's headstrong, driven, says what he thinks, doesn't really care what you think, does the work and plays to win. It was a perfect fit for the Heat, who like to say that they're not for everybody. Neither is Butler.",
      "Riley made two comments last spring that Butler surely didn't like: that he \u2014 and all of Miami's best-paid players \u2014 need to play more often, and that Butler shouldn't have talked about beating teams still in the playoffs when the Heat were not. (Butler made a comment about how if he wasn't hurt the Heat would have beaten Boston and New York in the postseason; Riley didn't like that he said that.)",
      "Butler has said for years that he only wants to be wanted. Evidently, he did not feel wanted in Miami any longer.",
      "There were a lot of factors in this story. Money was not the only issue, but it was among them.",
      "Wade thought about leaving in the summer of 2015 before he and the team agreed on a one-year, $20 million contract. A year later, the Heat offered Wade every dollar they had available \u2014 about $42 million for two years. Chicago offered about $47 million. And that was that.",
      "Chicago is Wade's hometown. Ironically, Butler was on that Bulls team that Wade was joining; Wade played a big role in convincing Butler to go to Miami in 2019. Eventually, whatever hard feelings existed between Wade and Heat went away; he finished his career in Miami and the team rewarded him with a statue earlier this season.",
      "Riley was contrite when Wade left.",
      "\u201cThat is where we both failed ... I more than he, because he\u2019s the asset, he\u2019s the star, he\u2019s the face of the franchise,\u201d Riley said at that time. \u201cI should have done everything that I could have verbally in trying to change his mindset to mine, a big picture, a better picture, or one that I thought would help him.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Wade's longtime agent, Henry Thomas, died. Riley was part of the Heat contingent that went to the funeral. He and Wade hugged. A couple weeks later, Miami swung a deal with Cleveland \u2014 Wade had moved on from Chicago \u2014 to bring the franchise's all-time scoring leader back to Miami.",
      "\u201cIt ended the way it was supposed to end,\u201d Wade said in his final days as a Heat player.",
      "O'Neal was traded to Miami in 2004. Two years later, the Heat won a title. Two years after that, they were broken down, Wade was hurt, and the team was headed to the bottom of the NBA.",
      "O'Neal didn't want to be in Miami anymore. He got traded to Phoenix. Initially, the breakup was not exactly amicable; over time, wounds were healed on both sides. O'Neal's number hangs from the rafters and he's welcomed back like a long-lost hero every time he's in Miami for a game.",
      "\u201cIt was not personal,\u201d Riley said when the team retired O'Neal's jersey in 2016. \u201cShaq was impeccable with his word. He came down here and said \u2018We\u2019re gonna win a title, Coach.\u2019 And we won a title. ... No hard feelings, at all. I\u2019m an Irishman and I forgive.\u201d",
      "There are a ton of theories about why James left the Heat after four years, four runs to the NBA Finals and two championships in Miami.",
      "Was everything perfect? No. But when the Heat lost the 2014 finals to San Antonio, ending their two-year reign as NBA champions, James was on the verge of free agency. It was widely believed that he would strongly consider leaving.",
      "\u201cYou've got to stay together \u2014 if you've got the guts \u2014 and you don't find the first door and run out of it,\u201d Riley said in a now-infamous speech a few days after that season ended.",
      "A couple weeks later, James made it official: He was going back to Cleveland.",
      "\u201cWhen I became a free agent in 2010, I felt what was best for me was to go to Miami,\u201d James would say in that first season back in Cleveland. \u201cAnd when I became a free agent once again this past summer, I thought what was best was going back home.\u201d",
      "And James' Heat fans are still fans. James got a huge ovation when he returned to Miami for the first time as an opponent \u2014 and still does a decade later. Riley announced years ago that James' number will also be retired by the Heat.",

      "BALTIMORE -- Baltimore's division-clinching victory over Cleveland was about as routine as expected.",
      "Except for one second-quarter play that could be a major problem for the Ravens' dynamic offense.",
      "Zay Flowers, the team's top receiver, went down with a knee injury and didn't return to the game Saturday. Coach John Harbaugh sounded somewhat optimistic afterward but said there would be an MRI.",
      "Baltimore finished the regular season 12-5 despite dropping its first two games. It's just one game worse than the record that gave the Ravens the league's best mark in 2023, but this time there will be no first-round bye. Baltimore will be the No. 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.",
      "So Flowers doesn't have much time to recover. The Pro Bowl receiver caught 74 passes for 1,059 yards and four touchdowns in the regular season.",
      "Baltimore trailed Pittsburgh by two games in the AFC North with four to play. Then the Ravens went 4-0 and the Steelers went 0-4 the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a week-to-week league, and you really just have to take it one week at a time, one day at a time, one play at time, and our guys have done a really good job of holding onto that,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat 1-0 T-shirt that we all wear around is real, and so, four wins later, we\u2019re the AFC North champions.\u201d",
      "You wouldn't think there'd be enough plays or enough footballs or enough yards on the field for both Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry to put up these numbers, but here are the final totals for the regular season. For Jackson: 4,172 yards passing and 915 rushing. For Henry: 1,921 yards rushing.",
      "The Ravens became the first team in NFL history with 4,000 yards passing and 3,000 rushing in one season. Obviously, the regular season is a bit longer now than it used to be \u2014 but Jackson and Henry both seem to have made each other better, and they've taken the offense to another level.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve won four in a row. I feel like everybody\u2019s been doing a great job of doing their jobs so we can execute on offense, and it\u2019s been fun,\" Henry said. \"We\u2019ve got to keep it going, stay locked in (and) hold each other accountable so we keep that same momentum in the playoffs.\u201d",
      "The wide receiver group could be thin if Flowers is limited. Rashod Bateman had a good game against Cleveland, and so did the tight end tandem of Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely, but receiver Tylan Wallace played 51 offensive snaps and finished with one target and no catches.",
      "Michael Pierce's first career interception was a late highlight in this game, and it also underscored how healthy he looks after four games back from an injured reserve stint.",
      "Pierce, listed at 355 pounds, had some running room on his interception but was about 80 yards from the end zone and gave himself up with a slide.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of turning big-guy interceptions and fumbles into memes, so at the risk of turning myself into one of those, I decided it was just time to go home,\u201d he said. \"Plus, I was out of gas, so it was good.\u201d",
      "Defensive back Brandon Stephens was targeted with some success by the Browns, and he can expect similar treatment in the playoffs after all the big defensive plays teammates Marlon Humphrey and Nate Wiggins have made.",
      "Bateman and safety Kyle Hamilton were both shaken up but returned to the field, so Flowers is the lone significant injury concern coming out of the game for the Ravens.",
      "Baltimore's last two games of the regular season were its best in terms of total yards allowed. The Ravens allowed just 211 in a 31-2 win at Houston, then 230 against the Browns.",
      "Baltimore's first-round playoff opponent depended on the result of the Chargers-Raiders game Sunday. The Ravens will host either the Chargers or the Steelers.",

      "BRISTOL, England -- U.S. rugby star Ilona Maher made her debut for the Bristol Bears women's team in front of a record home crowd of 9,240 fans on Sunday.",
      "But Maher, \u201c the most followed rugby player on the planet,\u201d could not prevent Bristol from losing 40-17 to defending champion Gloucester-Hartpury in a Premiership Women\u2019s Rugby match.",
      "She came on as a substitute in the 61st minute at Ashton Gate with Bristol trailing 28-10. Maher made her presence felt in a couple of rucks and looked for work off the wing but could make little impact to the overall picture in her 20 minutes on the field.",
      "The previous attendance record for a Bristol women\u2019s home match was 4,101 against Harlequins in May 2022. Such was the anticipation surrounding Maher's debut that Bristol relocated the match from a smaller venue to Ashton Gate to satisfy demand for seats.",
      "The 28-year-old Maher, who helped lead the U.S. to the bronze medal in rugby sevens at the Paris Games, has signed a three-month contract with Bristol in southwestern England. She had begun training with Bristol in December when the team announced the signing before going back to the United States for the holidays.",
      "Maher has more than 8 million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok. She was a runner-up on the \u201cDancing With The Stars\" TV show.",
      "The Vermont native is returning to the 15-a-side game in hopes of boosting her chances of making the U.S. team for the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England. She can play at wing or center.",
      "Bristol also said the attendance was a record for a stand-alone game in the Premiership. League-leading Harlequins said they set a women\u2019s club rugby record for attendance on Dec. 28 when 18,055 fans watched the team beat Leicester Tigers 42-17 at Twickenham Stadium. That was not a stand-alone match; it was part of a doubleheader with the Harlequins men\u2019s team.",

      "Dorsey and Dickerson were informed of the moves in the aftermath of the team's 35-10 loss in Baltimore on Saturday.",

      "Dickerson had replaced Bill Callahan when he joined his son Brian's staff in Tennessee.",
      "Dorsey played quarterback for the Browns \u2014 one of the 40 the team has started since 1999. He was hired to restructure Cleveland's offense around quarterback Deshaun Watson. But things didn't click and Watson wound up rupturing his Achilles tendon and playing in just seven games.",
      "Watson went 1-6 and failed to throw for at least 200 yards in any game. After Watson got hurt, Dorsey took over play-calling duties from Stefanski.",
      "Replacing the respected Callahan was going to be tough for any coach. The Browns' running game never got going under Dickerson's direction and Cleveland's O-line gave up 66 sacks, although some of those were on the QBs.",

    "summary": "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of its visitors was largely blocked in court before taking effect Jan. 1",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify their visitors' age was largely blocked in court before it was to take effect Jan. 1, even as similar laws kicked in for Florida and South Carolina and remained in effect for more than a dozen other states.",
      "On Dec. 30, U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman in Memphis ruled that Tennessee's law would likely suppress the First Amendment free speech rights of adults without actually preventing children from accessing the harmful material in question. The state attorney general's office is appealing the decision.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group, is suing over Tennessee's law and those in a half-dozen other states. The coalition lists some 19 states that have passed similar laws. One prominent adult website has cut off access in several states due to their laws.",
      "The issue will hit the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments regarding Texas' law next week.",
      "No one voted against Tennessee's law last year when it passed the Republican-supermajority legislature, and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on it.",
      "The law would require porn websites to verify visitors are at least 18 years old, threatening felony penalties and civil liability possible for violators running the sites. They could match a photo to someone's ID, or use certain \u201cpublic or private transactional data\u201d to prove someone\u2019s age. Website leaders could not retain personally identifying information and would have to keep anonymized data.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition and other plaintiffs sued, winning a preliminary injunction that blocks the attorney general from enforcement while court proceedings continue. However, the coalition expressed concern that private lawsuits or actions by individual district attorneys could be possible.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Lipman wrote that parental controls on minors' devices are more effective and less restrictive.",
      "She wrote that under Tennessee's law, minors still could access adult sites using VPNs, or virtual private networks, that mask a user's location. Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",
      "The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.",
      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition has argued the law would be ineffective, unconstitutional and force people to transfer sensitive information.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",
      "Another age verification law is set to begin in July in Georgia."

      "The multi-day event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas \u2014 where swaths of the latest gadgets and advances across industries like personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more are set to be on display. And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "Data collected by Tesla on the driver and vehicle in the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion and then shared with law enforcement has shined a spotlight on a difficult ethical question for the auto industry: Are companies violating your privacy rights",
      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",
      "Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.",
      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",
      "\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d",
      "Tesla shortly thereafter swung into action.",
      "\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d",
      "Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.",
      "There are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.",
      "Daniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.",
      "\u201cI think law enforcement should have access to data that can help them solve things quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have a right to privacy.\u201d"

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

      "The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as \u201cRelayRides,\u201d but rebranded to Turo in 2015.",
      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",

      "Kwon entered the plea in Manhattan federal court two days after his extradition from Montenegro.",
      "The indictment alleges that the man dubbed by some as \u201cthe cryptocurrency king\u201d lied to investors from 2018 to 2022 to fool them into pouring money into Terraform Labs, the Singapore crypto firm he cofounded.",

      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira made the request on Monday.",
      "Donald Trump's former co-defendants are asking the judge who tossed his classified documents case to issue an emergency order blocking the public release of Special Counsel Jack Smith's final report about his investigation of the president-elect.",
      "Lawyers for Trump's former co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, asked Judge Aileen Cannon -- who dismissed the case in July after deeming Smith's appointment unconstitutional -- to issue an order barring Attorney General Merrick Garland from publicly releasing the report by Jan. 10.",
      "The unorthodox legal maneuver came the same day Trump's personal lawyers sent a letter to Garland demanding he remove Smith from his post and defer the decision about the report's release to Trump's incoming attorney general, Pam Bondi.",
      "\"No report should be prepared or released, and Smith should be removed, including for even suggesting that course of action given his obvious political motivations and desire to lawlessly undermine the transition,\" wrote Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, Trump's defense attorneys and his picks for top posts within the Department of Justice.",
      "While Trump's criminal cases have largely faded since his election in November, Trump's lawyers have spent the final days ahead of his inauguration attempting to clear the traces of his criminal cases, including by attempting to delay Trump's Jan. 10 sentencing in his New York case and block the release of the report summarizing Smith's investigation.",
      "Smith has been winding down his cases against Trump -- moving to dismiss Trump's election interference case and dropping their appeal of his classified documents case against Trump -- and is expected to submit a final report about his investigations to Garland before stepping down.",
      "While Special Counsels normally prepare reports at the end of their investigations, Trump's lawyers argued that releasing Smith's report -- which they reviewed a draft of over the weekend -- would be \"nothing more than a lawless political stunt\" that harms the transition effort and \"violates fundamental norms regarding the presumption of innocence.\"",
      "In addition to demanding Garland prevent the report's release, lawyers for Trump's former co-defendants separately asked Judge Cannon to issue an order blocking the release of the report because Smith lacks the authority to serve as special counsel and therefore should not have access to the materials in the report.",
      "Cannon dismissed the case against Trump and his co-defendants based on the same rationale, finding that Smith's appointment and funding as Special Counsel were unconstitutional.",
      "\"Despite losing in court and having no valid appointment, Smith is determined to continue litigating this case in the court of public opinion,\" lawyers for Nauta and De Oliveira wrote.",
      "Lawyers for the men accused of helping Trump illegally store classified documents and obstruct justice argued that releasing the report would harm any future proceedings by tainting potential jurors and make the defense \"unreasonably difficult.\"",

    "summary": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured a unique image that revealed 44 individual stars in a galaxy 6.5 billion light-years away from the Milky Way.",
    "story": [
      "The most powerful telescope ever put into space has made a historic discovery.",
      "The most powerful telescope to be launched into space has made history by detecting a record number of new stars in a distant galaxy.",
      "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, history's largest and most complex space observatory that serves thousands of astronomers around the world, has captured a unique image that revealed 44 individual stars in a galaxy 6.5 billion light-years away from the Milky Way, according to a paper published Monday in Nature Astronomy.",
      "Astronomers used Webb's high-resolution optics and distortion in space to reveal the existence of dozens of previously unknown stars, the researchers said. The detection of a \"treasure trove\" of stars was only possible because the light from the 44 new stars was magnified by a large cluster of galaxies, called Abell 370, in front of it, according to the Center for Astrophysics.",
      "The technique is known as gravitational lensing, which is when a massive amount of matter -- like a cluster of galaxies -- creates a gravitational field that distorts and magnifies the light from distant galaxies that are behind it but in the same line of sight, according to NASA. The effect is essentially like looking through a giant magnifying glass.",
      "The strong gravitational magnification enabled astronomers to detect faint background sources and study their internal structures, which can lead to identifying individual stars in distant galaxies, according to the paper.",
      "Gravitational lensing is also known as the \"Einstein Ring\" because renowned physicist Albert Einstein predicted the possibility in his theory of general relativity.",
      "A visible arc created by gravitational lensing and the bending of light beyond Abell 370 was dubbed the \"Dragon Arc.\" After carefully analyzing the colors of each of the stars inside the Dragon Arc, the researchers found many are red supergiants, which are stars in their final stages of life.",
      "The discovery contrasts with earlier findings, which predominantly identified blue supergiants, which are among the brightest stars in the night sky, according to the Center for Astrophysics.",
      "In the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, astronomers can observe stars one by one. But for galaxies billions of light-years away, the stars appear blended together due to the distance.",
      "\"To us, galaxies that are very far away usually look like a diffuse, fuzzy blob,\" lead author Yoshinobu Fudamoto, an assistant professor at Chiba University in Japan, said in a statement.",
      "The Center for Astrophysics likened the chances of finding individual stars halfway across the observable universe to \"raising a pair of binoculars at the moon in hopes of making out individual grains of dust inside its craters.\" The discovery came by happenstance, as the astronomers were looking for a background galaxy but instead found the individual stars, according to Fengwu Sun, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Astrophysics and co-author of the study.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" Sun said. \"We now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "Launched on Dec. 25, 2021, the Webb telescope orbits the sun about 1 million miles from Earth and gathers data to help astronomers study every phase of the history of the universe, from the Big Bang to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life, according to NASA.",
      "NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits Earth, has previously detected seven stars.",
      "The Webb telescope's historic discovery will allow astronomers going forward to investigate \"one of the universe's greatest mysteries -- dark matter,\" according to the Center for Astrophysics.",
      "\"Observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",
      "Future Webb telescope observations are expected to capture more magnified stars in the Dragon Arc galaxy, according to the Center for Astrophysics.",

      "President Joe Biden is signing a proclamation to establish two new national monuments in California in part to honor two tribes",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is signing a proclamation to establish two new national monuments in California, in part to honor two tribes, a person familiar with the decision said Monday.",
      "The proclamation will create the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park and the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument in Northern California, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans that were to be announced Tuesday in California.",
      "The declaration bars drilling and mining and other development on the 600,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) area in Southern California and roughly 200,000 acres (800 square kilometers) in Northern California.",
      "The establishment of new monuments were first reported in The Washington Post. Biden, who has two weeks left in office, is in New Orleans on Monday meeting with the families of the victims in the New Year's attack in the French Quarter and was heading to California later Monday.",
      "The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic president\u2019s \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d initiative launched in 2021, aimed at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of public lands and waters by 2030 and addressing climate change.",
      "The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument. A number of Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the large desert lizard, at the start of 2023.",
      "The area would protect public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River.",
      "Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape, ensure access to nature for local residents and preserve military history sites. The California Legislature passed a resolution in August 2024 to urge Biden to establish the Chuckwalla National Monument and another National Park Service-managed national monument adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park, as well as the Kw\u2019ts\u00e1n National Monument, which would border Mexico and Arizona.",
      "Tribal leaders have also called for the Chuckwalla monument to honor tribal sovereignty to include local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations.",
      "\u201cThe protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,\" the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe said in a statement. \u201cTribes being reunited as stewards of this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this place.\u201d",
      "In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in California \u2014 the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is preserved.",
      "Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the first Native people to receive tribal land back from the National Park Service under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe, Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League.",

      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Three special elections taking place on Tuesday to fill seats in the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates will determine whether Democrats or Republicans have control of the Statehouse in Republican Glenn Youngkin's final year as governor.",
      "In northern Loudoun County, Republican Tumay Harding and Democrat Del. Kannan Srinivasan are vying to succeed Suhas Subramanyam in the state Senate after the Democrat was elected to the U.S. House in November. Also on the ballot are Democrat JJ Singh and Republican Ram Venkatachalam, who are racing to replace Srinivasan in the state House of Delegates after he vacated his seat to run in the special Senate election.",
      "In central Goochland County, Republican Luther Cifers is up against Democrat Jack Trammell, a college professor, in a state Senate race. They hope to succeed U.S. Rep. John McGuire, who clinched Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District after narrowly defeating former U.S. Rep. Bob Good by less than a percentage point in a bitter primary, which led to a recount in August.",
      "The special elections are being closely watched by outside observers to gauge voters\u2019 moods after November\u2019s presidential race, which left many Democrats reckoning with the party\u2019s losses in federal elections. In Virginia, Senate Democrats have a narrow 20-18 majority since McGuire and Subramanyam's resignations, making the special elections key to the party\u2019s efforts to preserve a majority in both chambers. In the House of Delegates, Democrats have a 50-49 lead following Srinivasan\u2019s departure.",
      "Srinivasan, the first Indian American immigrant elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, and Singh, a Virginia native and the son of Indian immigrants, are hoping to hold the Democratic seats within a county where data shows that Vice President Kamala Harris received 57% of the vote in her failed bid against President-elect Donald Trump. Both Singh and Srinivasan have largely centered their campaigns around abortion rights in Virginia. It comes at a time when state Democrats are working to enshrine a constitutional right to an abortion in the state.",
      "\u201cWhat motivates me is the high-stakes election,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cThe Senate majority is on the line. The constitutional amendment is on the line.\u201d",
      "Harding, the daughter of Turkish Uzbek immigrants and Venkatachalam, an Indian American immigrant, aim to flip the senate and house seats from Democrats. Both candidates, who each unsuccessfully ran for the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors in 2023, have centered their state campaigns along party lines, such as parents\u2019 rights, crime and the economy.",
      "\u201cOur schools are faltering and riddled with politics and division, our neighbors have been made victims of illegal migrant crime, and our families are struggling to afford groceries, gas, and housing,\u201d Harding said in a statement when launching her campaign. \u201cAll of this could change if we win this election and give Governor Youngkin a new majority in the Senate.\u201d",
      "In the 10th State Senate district, conservatives are putting their weight behind Cifers to succeed McGuire following a lengthy, multi-ballot primary among Republican voters last month. Cifers, a Prince Edward County resident and president of a Virginia kayaking business, said he never envisioned himself running for office but wanted to bring a different perspective to the legislature, particularly regarding housing and the economy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about doing the right thing, making sure that we\u2019re constitutionally minded and respecting the will of the voters before I\u2019m super interested in getting into party politics,\u201d Cifers said.",
      "Trammell, who unsuccessfully ran for the 7th U.S. House District in 2014, is hoping to flip the Republican stronghold, which supported Trump by more than 25 points in November, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Trammell said he partly decided to run for office because he believed his community should have a competitive electoral process.",
      "\u201cThere are factors that are transforming District 10,\u201d he said. \u201cTo call it a monolithic, traditional-rural Republican district is a little bit of a disservice to the people who are actually living there, working there and raising families there now.\u201d",

      "\"All of that and more is a strong and effective response to the provocations from North Korea,\" Blinken said. \"So I have confidence that, because it's so in the interest of all of us, it will continue and future administrations, whether it's here, whether it's in the United States, whether it's Japan, we'll continue to build on the work.\"",
      "Tokyo reacted swiftly to the launch, saying it was reinforcing its regional alliances through coordinated action with the United States and South Korea. Officials condemned Pyongyang while emphasizing the importance of a unified approach.",
      "Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, speaking from Indonesia, issued a strong condemnation, describing the repeated launches as a grave threat to Japan's national security and regional peace.",
      "\"We strongly protest and denounce North Korea's actions, which endanger not only our country but also the international community,\" he said, reaffirming Japan's commitment to work closely with the U.S. and South Korea to bolster deterrence and conduct thorough surveillance.",
      "Many office workers in Tokyo were returning to their jobs after the New Year's holidays when news of the launch broke. The projectile reached an altitude of about 62 miles and traveled about 684 miles before falling into the Sea of Japan, another name for the East Sea, and outside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, according to Japan's Ministry of Defense. The Japan Coast Guard confirmed that no damage to vessels in the affected area had been reported.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed serious concern about North Korea's advancements in missile technology.",
      "\"The frequency of these launches and the evident improvement in technology demand that we redouble our efforts to strengthen deterrence,\" he said during a press conference. \"Japan's peace and independence must be safeguarded by our own resolve.\"",

      "It's expected to be one of the president's last major pieces of legislation.",
      "President Joe Biden signed the Social Security Fairness Act into law Sunday afternoon, marking what is expected to be one of the last major pieces of legislation of his presidency.",
      "Prior to signing the bill, Biden touted the importance of Social Security benefits for working class Americans and said he was \"proud to have played a small part in this fight and get to sign it.\"",
      "\"The bill I'm signing today is about a simple proposition: Americans who have worked hard all their lives to earn an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,\" he said.",
      "The act repeals provisions that limit the ability of some retirees who also collect pensions from claiming Social Security benefits. Among those impacted are retirees who at one time worked as firefighters, teachers, postal workers, police officers, or in other public sector jobs. A provision that limits the benefits allotted to those workers' surviving spouses is also eliminated.",
      "The bill was passed in the Senate in December after passing the House in November with overwhelming bipartisan support.",
      "Ahead of the bill signing on Sunday, a White House official called Biden \"the first President in more than twenty years to expand Social Security benefits.\"",
      "\"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans,\" the official said.",
      "As Biden looks to shore up his legacy during his final weeks in office, the official also pointed to other moves that Biden has made to strengthen Social Security and other programs as \"reckless\" Republicans have worked to make cuts.",
      "Lawmakers across party lines have praised the legislation which stands to help millions of Americans.",
      "\"I am so thankful that we in the federal government are keeping a promise on earned benefits to return that which is due to the people who have given their lives to serve the public,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said after its passage in the Senate last month.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said, \"It is a wonderful way to end the year. We'll be bringing some equity in my state, where 250,000 workers will be helped by this. It really is to me about this canary pin, and about the dignity of work and fighting for workers.\"",

      "Santos is currently scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 7 in Central Islip, New York, after pleading guilty to federal fraud, campaign finance and embezzlement charges.",
      "His attorneys asked the judge to postpone the sentencing by six months, until August, to give Santos more time to make money so he can meet the nearly $600,000 he owes in restitution and forfeiture, according to a new court filing.",
      "\"Mr. Santos now has a viable path to making meaningful progress on satisfying his obligations,\" his lawyers stated in a motion filed on Friday, citing the launch of a new podcast, \"Pants on Fire with George Santos.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors did not immediately respond, though the defense noted that the government opposes a delay.",

Santos conceded he was trying to meet the fundraising threshold to qualify for financial help from the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "He told reporters at the time that the guilty plea was the \"right thing to do.\"",
      "\"This plea is not just an admission of guilt,\" Santos said. \"It's an acknowledgment that I need to be held accountable like any other American that breaks the law.\"",
      "Santos also stipulated that he committed other fraud, including charging donor credit cards without authorization and convincing donors to give money by falsely stating the money would be used for TV ads. He also stipulated he stole public money by applying for and receiving unemployment benefits during the pandemic to which he was not entitled.",
      "Santos conceded in a statement to the court his actions \"betrayed\" his constituents and others.",

      "A thin GOP majority means a reconciliation bill will also be a major challenge.",
      "Newly reelected Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans during a closed-door policy retreat on Saturday that President-elect Donald Trump wants Congress to pass one sweeping bill full of his priorities through the budget reconciliation process, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "Johnson said Trump wants to pass \u201cone big, beautiful bill,\u201d according to sources.",
      "House Republicans are meeting privately at Fort McNair to map their legislative strategy under Trump\u2019s presidency for taxes, the border and energy, among other policy areas.",
      "Trump\u2019s desire to have one bill instead of two is a break from what Senate Majority Leader John Thune has laid out as his plan, which includes two separate packages, multiple outlets have reported.",
      "With a trifecta in the House, the Senate and the White House, Republicans will have the ability to attempt to implement major policy changes without any Democratic support using a procedural tool called budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of votes to pass the chamber. But the razor-thin GOP majority in the House means a reconciliation package will also be a major challenge to pass.",
      "The House Freedom Caucus has endorsed a two-step plan rather than Trump's single bill, and the group of hard-liners may stand in the way of Trump\u2019s desires. On Friday, several members of the House Freedom Caucus nearly stopped Johnson from getting selected as speaker on the first round, though most of them ultimately voted for Johnson to allow him to obtain the 218 votes needed to be elected. Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie was the only House Republican who didn't vote for Johnson.",
      "Legislation passed via budget reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to avert the 60-vote threshold from the filibuster, would need consensus among House Republicans with their majority of 219 Republicans to 215 Democrats. If they wish to pass legislation without any Democratic support, they can only have one GOP defection if all members of the House are present. The single bill Trump favors through reconciliation would put the GOP caucus to the test.",
      "\u201cThere are a group of us who support breaking it up into two pieces,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris said on Saturday during a Fox News interview. \"The first piece, a very small border piece where we give the president the money that he needs to secure our southern border and start deporting illegal, criminal aliens.\"",

      "Beginning Tuesday afternoon, the windstorm will affect Los Angeles and Ventura counties and peak in the early hours of Wednesday, when gusts could reach 80 mph (129 kph), the National Weather Service said Monday. Isolated gusts could top 100 mph (160 kph) in mountains and foothills.",
      "The weather service warned of downed trees and knocked over big rigs, trailers, and motorhomes. Powerful offshore gusts will also bring dangerous conditions off the coasts of Orange County and LA, including Catalina Island, and potential delays and turbulence could arise at local airports.",

    "story": [
      "A judge has found Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court for failing to properly respond to requests for information in response to a $148 million defamation judgment granted to two Georgia election workers",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge in New York City on Monday said that Rudy Giuliani was in contempt of court for failing to properly respond to requests for information as he turned over assets to satisfy a $148 million defamation judgment granted to two Georgia election workers.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled after hearing Giuliani testify for a second day at a contempt hearing called after lawyers for the election workers said the former New York City mayor had failed to properly comply with evidence production requests over the last few months.",
      "On Friday, Giuliani testified for about three hours in Liman's Manhattan courtroom, but the judge permitted him to finish testifying remotely on Monday from his condominium in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "At the start of the hearing Monday, Giuliani had an American flag backdrop, which he said he uses for a program he conducts over the internet, but the judge told him to change it to a plain background.",
      "Giuliani conceded during Monday\u2019s testimony that he sometimes did not turn over everything requested because he believed the requests were overly broad or inappropriate or even a \u201ctrap\u201d set by lawyers for the plaintiffs.",
      "He also said he sometimes had trouble turning over information regarding his assets because of numerous criminal and civil court cases requiring him to produce factual information.",
      "Giuliani, 80, said the demands to turn over materials made it \u201cimpossible to function in an official way\u201d about 30% to 40% of the time.",
      "The election workers\u2019 lawyers say Giuliani has displayed a \u201cconsistent pattern of willful defiance\u201d of Liman\u2019s October order to give up assets after he was found liable in 2023 for defaming their clients by falsely accusing them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election.",
      "They said in court papers that he has turned over a Mercedes-Benz and his New York apartment but not the paperwork necessary to monetize the assets. And they said he has failed to surrender watches and sports memorabilia, including a Joe DiMaggio jersey, and has not turned over \u201ca single dollar from his nonexempt cash accounts.\u201d",
      "Giuliani said Monday that he was investigating what happened to the DiMaggio jersey and that he currently doesn\u2019t know where it is or who has it.",
      "Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the election workers, asked the judge to make inferences about what Giuliani had not turned over \u2014 such as the list of his doctors over the last four years \u2014 that would make it more likely the court would conclude that the Palm Beach property was not Giuliani\u2019s primary residence and thus is not protected from seizure.",
      "Joseph Cammarata, Giuliani\u2019s attorney, said reaching such a conclusion would be like a civil \u201cdeath penalty\u201d and would cause Giuliani to lose the Florida property even before a trial in mid-January, when the judge is supposed to hear testimony and view evidence before deciding the disposition of the condominium and World Series rings.",
      "Giuliani has insisted that the Palm Beach property is his personal residence now and should be shielded from the judgment.",
      "His lawyers have predicted that he will eventually win custody of the items on appeal."

    "story": [
      "As a member of the elite, informal club of U.S. presidents past and present, Jimmy Carter was uniquely positioned to do important work for his successors, whether Democrat or Republican",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Carter and the man he beat for president, Gerald Ford, got so tight after office that their friendship became a kind of buddy movie, complete with road trips that were never long enough because they had so much to gab about.",
      "Carter did not get along nearly so well with the other living presidents. The outsider president was an outlier after his presidency, too.",
      "Nevertheless, past and present occupants of the office will attend Carter's state funeral this week in what could be the largest gathering of the presidents club since five attended Washington services for George H.W. Bush in December 2018.",
      "As a member of that elite, informal club, Carter was uniquely positioned to do important work for his successors, whether Democrat or Republican. He achieved significant results at times, thanks to his public stature as a peacemaker, humanitarian and champion of democracy and his deep relationships with foreign leaders, troublemakers included.",
      "But with Carter, you never knew when he\u2019d go rogue. This was a man so self-confident, he described himself as \u201cprobably superior\u201d to the other ex-presidents who were still knocking about. Ornery about taking orders, he could be invaluable to the man in office, exasperating, or both at once.",
      "The others often bonded over \u201cwhat an annoying cuss Carter could be,\u201d Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy wrote in their book \u201cThe Presidents Club.\u201d",
      "\u201cCarter was the driven, self-righteous, impatient perfectionist who united the other club members around what seemed like an eternal question: was Jimmy Carter worth the trouble?\u201d",
      "He was, in the mind of Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College historian of religion and Carter\u2019s rise to the presidency. Balmer points to the violence averted in the last hours before a U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1994, when Carter, to the benefit of Democratic President Bill Clinton and countless lives saved, brokered a deal with Haiti\u2019s military coup leader to step aside and restore democracy.",
      "\u201cAny time you can avoid military conflict you score that as a win,\u201d Balmer said.",
      "Four years earlier, for the benefit of Republican President George H.W. Bush and the lives at stake in the region, Carter secured peace in Nicaragua at the brink of bloodshed when he persuaded the leftist leader Daniel Ortega to accept the electoral defeat that had so shocked the Sandinistas.",
      "John Danforth, former Republican senator from Missouri, joined Carter on missions to lay the groundwork for the 1990 Nicaragua election and then monitor it. In the first, the Carter entourage came upon Ortega's motorcade on a dusty road through the town of Rivas.",
      "The two men retired to the backyard of the nearest house for an impromptu negotiation over the government trucks Carter wanted Ortega to send around the country to deliver election material.",
      "\u201cOften when we envision former presidents, the picture is distant, even stuffy: men in dark suits and neckties captured in formal poses as though engaged in deep thoughts,\u201d Danforth wrote in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in February 2023. \"My picture of Carter is quite the contrary. He is in a back yard in Rivas. A crowing rooster is at his feet. An earnest expression is on his face. He\u2019s not talking statecraft; he\u2019s talking trucks.\u201d",
      "Yet he could infuriate those in power. Years after the U.S.-led Gulf War rolled back Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, it emerged that Carter had lobbied U.N. Security Council members and foreign leaders to reject the elder Bush\u2019s request to authorize the use of force.",
      "After being mostly sidelined by the man who defeated him in 1980, Ronald Reagan, Carter was given several missions by Bush until the Gulf War episode, after which he was cut off, Gibbs and Duffy write.",
      "His relationship with Clinton was limited and uneasy, bookended by Clinton\u2019s reluctance to call on a figure who symbolized humiliating election defeat for Democrats and by Carter\u2019s disapproval of Clinton\u2019s behavior outside his marriage.",
      "But after Clinton won the White House in 1992, he sent Carter to North Korea to take the measure of dictator Kim Il Sung. Clinton aides were livid when Carter went beyond his brief, engaging in an unauthorized negotiation with Kim and, what\u2019s more, talking about it on TV.",
      "But then, Carter was always a step apart from the rest. He was also one to wag a finger at the political establishment, if not to pulverize it like Donald Trump did.",
      "In January 2009, President George W. Bush invited other members of the presidents club to the White House for lunch and Oval Office photos. Bush, his father, Clinton and President-elect Barack Obama are seen clustered in front of the Resolute Desk. Carter is conspicuously off to the side \u2014 outlying.",
      "The images spoke volumes about Carter\u2019s place in the club, Balmer said. \u201cJimmy Carter didn\u2019t fit in with a lot of people. He was really an introvert, not somebody who warms up easily.\u201d",
      "If politics makes strange bedfellows, though, post-politics makes even stranger ones. The embedded hostilities of Democrat-versus-Republican can melt in the presidents club as former rivals become unlikely mates.",
      "Except with Trump. Regardless of party, the club members disdained Trump in his first term, and he had no use for them.",
      "When Carter turned 100 in October, Trump marked the occasion by declaring that Joe Biden is so bad a president that Carter must be \u201cthe happiest man because Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison.\u201d",
      "Trump was more sober in response to Carter's death, saying \u201cthe challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\u201d",
      "Democrat Lyndon Johnson leaned frequently on Republican predecessor Dwight Eisenhower, telling him \u201cYou\u2019re the best chief of staff I\u2019ve got.\u201d On the night of John Kennedy\u2019s assassination, LBJ sought Ike\u2019s advice on what to say to Congress, adding: \u201cI need you more than ever now.\u201d",
      "Reagan once pulled Clinton aside to tell him the military salute he was executing during the campaign was too lame for the presidency. He taught him how to make it snappy. Clinton in turn cherished his long and frequent phone calls with Richard Nixon, confiding in the disgraced but savvy Republican on foreign policy problems of the era.",
      "Clinton also became close to the Republican he vanquished in 1992, joining the elder Bush in Maine for golf, zippy boat rides and nights by the sea.",
      "More consequentially, the younger Bush asked his dad and Clinton to lead a fundraising mission for countries devastated by the 2004 tsunami, giving rise to a bipartisan pairing that pitched in on more endeavors, like Hurricane Katrina relief. \u201cI just loved him,\u201d Clinton said upon Bush\u2019s death in 2018.",
      "So, too, Obama and the younger Bush have teamed up on occasion and Bush enjoys an especially good-natured relationship with Michelle Obama.",
      "But the Jimmy-Jerry friendship was one for the ages.",
      "Carter took it as a point of pride when two historians, speaking separately at a commemoration of the 200th birthday of the White House, said his friendship with Ford was the most intensely personal between any two presidents in history.",
      "Carter said it began in 1981, when the two were sent by Reagan to represent the U.S. at the funeral of Anwar Sadat, the assassinated Egyptian leader. Nixon was on the trip, too, somewhat awkwardly. The other two took to each other, commiserating over how tough it could be to raise money for a presidential library when you\u2019ve been booted out of office.",
      "They were both Navy men, had three sons, a strong religious faith that Ford was quieter about than Carter, and independent spouses who bonded as well. \u201cThe four of us learned to love each other,\u201d Carter said.",
      "Carter and Ford spoke regularly, teamed up as co-leaders on dozens of projects and decided together which events they\u2019d attend and skip in tandem.",
      "\u201cWhen we were traveling somewhere in an automobile or airplane, we hated to reach our destination, because we enjoyed the private times that we had together,\u201d Carter said.",
      "That\u2019s what he told mourners in January 2007, at a service for Ford the month after he died at age 93.",
      "The Democrat and the Republican he so cherished had made a pact, one hard to imagine in this time of partisan poison: Whoever died first would be eulogized by the other."

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minneapolis City Council is expected to decide Monday whether to approve an agreement with the federal government in response to the murder of George Floyd that would require major reforms within the city's police department under long-term court supervision.",
      "The agreement, known as a consent decree, has been under negotiation since the Department of Justice issued a scathing critique of the city's police in June 2023, alleging that they systematically discriminated against racial minorities, violated constitutional rights and disregarded the safety of people in custody for years before Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis officer in 2020. Floyd's death prompted a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.",
      "The Justice Department report was the result of a sweeping two-year investigation that confirmed many citizen complaints about police conduct. The investigation found that Minneapolis officers used excessive force, including \u201cunjustified deadly force,\u201d and violated the rights of people engaged in constitutionally protected speech.",
      "As a result, the city and police department agreed to negotiate a deal with the federal agency to require changes overseen by an independent monitor and approved by a federal judge. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, several council members and police accountability activists all welcomed the prospect at the time as a move toward healing the city.",
      "Frey called a special City Council meeting for Monday \u201cfor the purpose of receiving a briefing on the litigation matter of U.S. Department of Justice v. City of Minneapolis and Minneapolis Police Department, including resolution possibilities.\u201d After a closed-door discussion that began Monday morning, the council was expected to reconvene in public in the afternoon for a vote.",
      "During his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of consent decrees as anti-police. Finalizing the Minneapolis agreement before he returns to office Jan. 20 would make it harder for him to undercut the deal, because changes would require court approval.",
      "A state court judge in 2023 approved a similar agreement between Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the state agency issued its own blistering report in 2022.  The state investigation found that the city's police had engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade.",
      "The Justice Department has opened 12 similar investigations of state and local law enforcement agencies since April 2021, many in response to high-profile deaths at the hands of police.",
      "It has reached agreements with Seattle, New Orleans, Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. A consent decree with Louisville, Kentucky, after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor is waiting court approval. In Memphis, Tennessee, the mayor last month pushed back against pressure for a consent decree there, saying his city has made hundreds of positive changes since the beating death of Tyre Nichols.",
      "Consent decrees require law enforcement to meet specific goals before federal oversight is removed, a process that often takes years and millions of dollars. A major reason Minneapolis hired Brian O\u2019Hara as police chief in 2022 was his experience implementing a consent decree in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "If the Minneapolis federal agreement gets court approval, the city would be in the unusual position of operating under both federal and state consent decrees.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's top financial regulator said Monday that he would resign next month, avoiding a potential confrontation with the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in the Senate.",
      "Fed governor Michael Barr said in a letter to President Joe Biden that he would step down as vice chair for supervision Feb. 28, or earlier if a successor was confirmed. Yet Barr said he would remain on the Fed's board of governors. His term as governor lasts until 2032.",
      "Barr oversaw the proposal of tough new rules for the largest U.S. banks, which would have required them to significantly increase their financial reserves. The proposal sparked fierce opposition from the largest financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase, and was sharply criticized by Senate Republicans.",
      "During last year's presidential campaign, there were published reports that former president Donald Trump would try to fire or demote Barr. But at a press conference in November, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a president doesn't have the legal authority to do either one.",
      "Sen. Tim Scott, who is in line to chair the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the Fed, on Monday called Barr's proposed financial regulations \u201cdisastrous.\" He has previously said that they would limit lending by banks and weaken the economy.",
      "\u201cMichael Barr has failed to meet the responsibilities of his position,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \"I stand ready to work with President Trump to ensure we have responsible financial regulators at the helm.\u201d",
      "By stepping down as vice chair, but not governor, Barr has limited the Trump administration's options to replace him. All seven seats on the Fed's board of governors are filled, and an opening won't occur until Governor Adriana Kugler's term ends Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "As a result, for now President-elect Trump can only appoint another current governor to the top regulatory position, or wait until next year to fill the vacancy on the board with a new regulator. Governor Michelle Bowman, a Republican appointee, has publicly supported less stringent financial regulations and is a potential replacement.",
      "\u201cThe risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission,\u201d Barr said in a statement from the Fed. \"In the current environment, I\u2019ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor.\u201d",
      "Barr took office in June 2022 and was later embroiled in the spate of bank failures in the spring of 2023 that started with Silicon Valley Bank, the third-largest failure in U.S. history. Barr oversaw the preparation of a report that blamed watered-down bank regulations, the Fed's own staffers, and the banks' managers for the failures.",
      "Barr then proposed to tighten bank rules, particularly for those banks with $100 billion or more in assets, by requiring them to hold more capital in reserve. Previously, Trump appointees at the Fed had loosed rules for banks with less than $250 billion in assets.",
      "Yet those rules met with ferocious opposition from the banking industry, prompting Powell to announce last March that they would be revised.",
      "The Fed said Monday that it \u201cdoes not intend to take up any major rulemakings until a vice chair for supervision successor is confirmed.\u201d"

      "If you no longer want to take the trip, or found another way of getting to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money, even if you bought a non-refundable ticket. It doesn't matter why the flight was canceled.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t stick you with a voucher, you can get your money back,\u201d Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, told The Associated Press last year. \u201cThat means you have to cancel your entire reservation, but that could be an easy option for some travelers \u2014 especially if you wind up booking a flight on another carrier.\u201d",
      "You are also entitled to a refund of any bag fees, seat upgrades or other extras that you didn't get to use.",
      "U.S. airlines are not required to pay cash compensation and cover lodging and meals for passengers who are stranded, even if a flight cancellation is the airline's fault \u2014 such as the lack of a crew, a mechanical problem that grounds the plane, or a computer outage that brings the airline to a halt.",
      "The Biden administration said last month it was working on a proposal to change that. Such a rule would make U.S. policy more closely resemble airline consumer protections in Europe and go far beyond the current requirement for American airlines to issue ticket refunds.",
      "With just two weeks until President Joe Biden leaves office, the fate of additional regulations on airlines will be left in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "Each airline has its own policy. The U.S. Department of Transportation has a site that lets consumers see the commitments that each airline makes for refunds and covering other expenses when flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "If the weather forecast is troubling, consider booking a backup flight, says Potter, the Thrifty Traveler editor. Some airlines stand out as potential backups because they let customers get a full refund as long as they cancel within 24 hours of booking.",
      "If lots of flights are canceled, airline agents will soon be swamped. If you are in a group and one person belongs to a higher level of the airline\u2019s frequent-flyer program, use the number associated with that person to call the airline. You also can try calling your airline's international help number \u2014 usually available online \u2014 since those agents can make changes in your itinerary too.",
      "Be nice. The agent you're talking to is probably dealing with lots of other frustrated travelers too, and screaming at the agent won't make them want to help you. The cancellation isn't their fault."

      "Donald Trump\u2019s return to power has thrown into question the future of the more than 1,500 federal cases brought over the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol four years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- It's the largest prosecution in Justice Department history \u2014 with reams of evidence, harrowing videos and hundreds of convictions of the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Now Donald Trump's return to power has thrown into question the future of the more than 1,500 federal cases brought over the last four years.",
      "Jan. 6 trials, guilty pleas and sentencings have continued chugging along in Washington's federal court despite Trump's promise to pardon rioters, whom he has called \u201cpolitical prisoners\" and \u201chostages\u201d he contends were treated too harshly.",
      "Here's a look at where the prosecutions stand on the fourth anniversary of the Capitol riot and what could happen next:",
      "More than 1,500 people across the U.S. have been charged with federal crimes related to the deadly riot. Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were charged only with misdemeanor offenses for entering the Capitol illegally. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for beating police officers. Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump, a Republican, to Joe Biden, a Democrat.",
      "About 250 people have been convicted of crimes by a judge or a jury after a trial. Only two people were acquitted of all charges by judges after bench trials. No jury has fully acquitted a Capitol riot defendant. At least 1,020 others had pleaded guilty as of Jan. 1.",
      "More than 1,000 rioters have already been sentenced, with over 700 receiving at least some time behind bars. The rest were given some combination of probation, community service, home detention or fines.",
      "The longest sentence, 22 years, went to former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy along with three lieutenants. A California man with a history of political violence got 20 years in prison for repeatedly attacking police with flagpoles and other makeshift weapons during the riot. And Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes is serving an 18-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy and other offenses.",
      "More than 100 Jan. 6 defendants are scheduled to stand trial in 2025, while at least 168 riot defendants are set to be sentenced this year.",
      "Authorities have continued making new arrests since Trump's election victory. That includes people accused of assaulting police officers who were defending the Capitol.",
      "Citing Trump's promise of pardons, several defendants have sought to have their cases delayed \u2014 with little success.",
      "In denying one such request, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, wrote: \"This Court recently had the occasion to discuss what effect the speculative possibility of a presidential pardon has on the timetable for a pending criminal matter. In short: little to none.\"",
      "One defendant who convinced a judge to postpone his trial, William Pope, told the court that the \u201cAmerican people gave President Trump a mandate to carry out the agenda he campaigned on, which includes ending the January 6 prosecutions and pardoning those who exercised First Amendment rights at the Capitol.\u201d Pope has now asked the judge to allow him to travel to Washington to attend Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump embraced the Jan. 6 rioters on the campaign trial, downplaying the violence that was broadcast on live TV and has been documented extensively through video, testimony and other evidence in the federal cases.",
      "Trump has vowed to begin issuing pardons of Jan. 6 rioters on his first day in office. He has said he will look at individuals on a case-by-case basis, but he has not explained how he will decide who receives such relief.",
      "He has said there may be \u201csome exceptions\" \u2014 if \u201csomebody was radical, crazy.\" But he has not ruled out pardons for people convicted of serious crimes, like assaulting police officers. When confronted in a recent NBC News interview about the dozens of people who have pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement, Trump responded: \u201cBecause they had no choice.\"",
      "Many judges in Washington's federal court have condemned the depiction of the rioters as \u201cpolitical prisoners,\" and some have raised alarm about the potential pardons.",
      "\"No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending, the true story of what happened on January 6, 2021 will never change,\" Judge Lamberth recently said in a statement when handing down a sentence.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, has said it would be \u201cbeyond frustrating and disappointing\u201d if Trump hands out mass pardons to rioters.",
      "In another case, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta alluded to the prospect of a pardon for Rhodes, the Oath Keepers founder convicted of seditious conspiracy.",
      "\u201cThe notion that Stewart Rhodes could be absolved of his actions is frightening and ought to be frightening to anyone who cares about democracy in this country,\u201d said Mehta, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat.",

      "President Joe Biden is heading to New Orleans as the city reels from the deadly New Year\u2019s attack in which an Army veteran plowed a truck into revelers, killing 14 and injuring 30 more",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is taking a message to the grieving families of victims in the deadly New Year's attack in New Orleans: \u201cIt takes time. You got to hang on.\u201d",
      "Biden on Monday will visit the city where an Army veteran drove a truck into revelers in the French Quarter, killing 14 and injuring 30 more. It's likely to be the last time Biden travels to the scene of a horrific crime as president to console families of victims. He has less than two weeks left in office.",
      "It's a grim task that presidents perform, though not every leader has embraced the role with such intimacy as the 82-year-old Biden, who has experienced a lot of personal tragedy in his own life. His first wife and baby daughter died in a car accident in the early 1970s, and his eldest son, Beau, died of cancer in 2015.",
      "\u201cI've been there. There\u2019s nothing you can really say to somebody that\u2019s just had such a tragic loss,\" Biden told reporters Sunday in a preview of his visit. \"My message is going to be personal if I get to get them alone.\u201d",
      "Biden often takes the opportunity at such bleak occasions to speak behind closed doors with the families, offer up his personal phone number in case people want to talk later on and talk about grief in stark, personal terms.",
      "The Democratic president will continue on to California following his stop in New Orleans. The White House was moving forward with plans for the trip even as a snowstorm was hitting the Washington region.",
      "In New Orleans, the driver plowed into a crowd on the city's famous Bourbon Street. Fourteen revelers were killed along with the driver. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who steered his speeding truck around a barricade and plowed into the crowd, later was fatally shot in a firefight with police.",
      "Jabbar, an American citizen from Texas, had posted five videos on his Facebook account in the hours before the attack in which he proclaimed his support for the Islamic State militant group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the French Quarter.",
      "Biden on Sunday pushed back against conspiracy theories surrounding the attack, and he urged New Orleans residents to ignore them.",
      "\u201cI spent literally 17, 18 hours with the intelligence community from the time this happened to establish exactly what happened, to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that New Orleans was the act of a single man who acted alone,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this talk about conspiracies with other people, there\u2019s not evidence of that \u2014 zero.\u201d",
      "The youngest victim was 18 years old, and the oldest was 63. Most victims were in their 20s. They came from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, New Jersey and Great Britain.",
      "Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican, was asked on Fox News Channel what the city was hoping for from Biden's visit.",
      "\u201cHow can we not feel for both the families of those who die but also those who\u2019ve been injured in their families?\u201d he asked.",
      "\u201cThe best thing that the city, the state, and the federal government can do is do their best to make sure that this does not happen again. And what we can do as a people is to make sure that we don\u2019t live our lives in fear or in terror \u2014 but live our lives bravely and with liberty, and then support those families however they need support.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has a new focus as lawmakers brace for the prospect that President-elect Donald Trump may soon pardon many of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes for their actions related to the riot.",
      "Trump said he would issue pardons to rioters on \u201cDay 1\u201d of his presidency, which begins Jan. 20. \u201cMost likely, I\u2019ll do it very quickly,\u201d he said recently on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He added that \u201cthose people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look. But, you know, if somebody was radical, crazy.\u201d",
      "His promise, made throughout his campaign for the White House, is shadowing events Monday as lawmakers gather to certify a presidential election for the first time since 2021, when Trump\u2019s supporters breached the Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she has spoken at length with Trump and is lobbying him to pardon everyone who participated in the siege. Few Republicans are going that far, but many believe it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to look at pardons on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cHere we are nearly four years later. Many of these people have been in prison since 2021. Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they\u2019ve served their time and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,\" Greene said. \"Some of these people have been given prison sentences: 10 years, 18 years and more. I think it\u2019s an injustice. It\u2019s a two-tiered justice system, and it\u2019s time to end it.\u201d",
      "More than 1,250 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials in connection with Jan. 6, with more than 650 receiving prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",
      "Many of those who broke into the Capitol were echoing Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud. Some rioters menacingly called out the names of prominent politicians \u2014 particularly then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to try to object to Biden\u2019s win. Lawmakers who had evacuated both chambers on Jan. 6 returned that night to finish their work.",
      "Police officers who defended the Capitol are particularly incensed about the possible pardons. Many officers were beaten, some with their own weapons, as they tried to hold back the mob. About 140 officers were injured on Jan. 6, making it \u201clikely the largest single day mass assault of law enforcement\u201d in American history, Matthew Graves, the outgoing U.S. attorney in the nation's capital, has said.",
      "\u201cYou cannot be pro-police officer and rule of law if you are pardoning people who betrayed that trust, injured police officers and ransacked the Capitol,\u201d said Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who retired due to his injuries after fighting rioters.",
      "Some Republicans in Congress, even those closely aligned with Trump, suggested not all Jan. 6 offenders should be treated the same.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally who leads the House Judiciary Committee, said he supported some pardons, but also made a distinction.",
      "\u201cFor people who didn\u2019t commit any violence, I think everyone supports that. I think that makes sense,\u201d said Jordan, R-Ohio.",
      "Veteran Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., also wasn't ready to go as far as Greene. \"You've got to look at it individually. Some probably deserve to be pardoned,\u201d he said.",
      "But he was more reticent when asked if those who attacked U.S. Capitol police officers should be among those pardoned.",
      "\u201cMy goodness. Again, I'd have to look at the scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they attacked the U.S. Capitol Police, it's a big problem.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said not every single charge is the same and that people who were trespassing are a different category from those who entered the Capitol and damaged property. He said he believes Trump will look at each individual circumstance and decide what is appropriate.",
      "\u201cPeople who attacked police officers, listen, I don't think that is something we should ever condone,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "House Democrats, who led the drive to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and conducted a wide-ranging investigation into the attack, warned that the pardons could have far-reaching consequences, both for the rule of law and the security of the country. Members of the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, for instance, were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes in relation to the insurrection.",
      "\u201cThose 140-odd law enforcement people who got hurt defending this institution, I think anyone who loves peace and security would be offended that you would pardon people who attacked those individuals for doing their jobs,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.",
      "Thompson led the House committee that investigated the events surrounding Jan. 6, concluding with a report that said Trump \u201clit the fire\" for the insurrection.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who served as lead impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment trial in which he was acquitted, said if pardons are going to happen, people should demand contrition and repentance from each of those pardoned and an affirmative statement they pose no further threat to public safety.",
      "\u201cBecause anything that happens by these people, in a political context or some other context, will essentially be laid at the doorstep soon-to-be President Donald Trump,\u201d Raskin said.",
      "Like police officers who protected them, lawmakers who were in the Capitol during the attack have a visceral reaction to the pardon talk, having barely escaped a mob that seemed determined to do them harm.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., who was trapped in the House gallery as rioters tried to break in below, said it would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d for him and many others if Trump goes ahead with the pardons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty controlled and pretty disciplined, but that would be really hard,\u201d Himes said. \u201cToo many of us had very personal experiences with the people who are serving time or were convicted.\u201d",

      "\u201cWill be wild!\u201d Trump promised on Twitter a few weeks before Jan. 6, 2021. And it was.",
      "Trump gave a vitriolic speech to thousands of people gathered at the Ellipse behind the White House, after which many marched to the Capitol and stormed the building in an attempt to stop the previously routine final step in formalizing the winner of the presidential election. Even after the rioters dispersed, eight Republicans in the Senate and 139 in the House voted against ratifying Biden's win in certain swing states, despite no evidence of problems or wrongdoing that could have affected the outcome.",
      "This year, the only turbulence preceding the quadrennial ratification of the presidential election resulted from House Republicans fighting among themselves over who should be speaker.",
      "\u201cThere will be no violence. There will be no attempt to mount an insurrection against the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. \u201cIt will be a lot more like what we\u2019ve seen for the rest of American history.\u201d",
      "The last time, Trump urged his vice president, Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification, to intervene to keep him in the White House. This time, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee against Trump, has acknowledged her loss and isn't expected to try to change long-established procedures for certifying the election. No other prominent Democrat has urged the party to contest Trump's win, either.",
      "Congress also has since updated the law that governs the proceeding, clarifying the process in the states and specifying the vice president's role as merely ministerial.",
      "After the 2020 election, many Republicans contended there were signs of massive voter fraud that made it impossible to confirm Biden's victory, even though there has never been any indication of widespread fraud. After Trump won this November, many of those same Republicans had no such objections, saying they trusted the accuracy of the vote count. It was a change in sentiment shared by Republicans across the country.",
      "\u201cAs citizens, we should all be happy when it goes smoothly,\u201d said Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. \u201cIt's always better not to have major contestation over elections, especially when there isn't a reasonable position for it.\u201d",
      "Still, the calm may be illusory.",
      "Trump and Republicans had signaled that if had Harris won, they were prepared to contest her victory. Vice President-elect JD Vance, as an Ohio senator, argued that Pence should have acted to overturn Biden's election.",
      "Vance himself is set to be in the position to preside over the next significant Jan. 6 \u2014 in 2029, when Congress will be scheduled to accept the electoral votes for the winner of the 2028 presidential election.",
      "\u201cThe most dangerous January 6 event is not January 6, 2025. It\u2019s January 6, 2029, and beyond,\u201d said David Weinberg of Protect Democracy, which defends against what it terms authoritarian threats to the country. \u201cIt creates an enormous problem when only one side of the aisle stands down when it loses an election.\u201d",
      "The Constitution lays out some basic steps required to choose the next president, and congressional legislation has filled in the procedural blanks. After states choose their winning candidates on Election Day, electors who are pledged to vote for those candidates meet as the Electoral College and formally cast their votes for president.",
      "Congress then tallies the votes on Jan. 6 in a joint session presided over by the vice president to formally determine who's won a majority of the Electoral College.",
      "In 2021, Trump pushed for Pence not to read out the tallies from swing states that Biden won, thereby forcing Congress to vote to accept a list of states where Trump won the majority of the Electoral College. That ploy was something that Pence and numerous legal scholars said was an unconstitutional act.",
      "A year later, Biden signed the bipartisan bill that updated the 1887 law governing the joint session to make clear the vice president needs to read all of the state tallies. The Electoral Count Reform Act also makes it harder to object to the congressional vote.",
      "Still, many House Republicans remain opposed to that law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was a prime supporter of Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss and had not ruled out trying to change the election outcome if Trump lost in November. Republicans spent the final weeks of the election contending Democrats would do the same if Trump won, citing a push by some to disqualify the former president from the ballot under the Constitution's once-obscure \u201cinsurrection clause.\" That effort ultimately was rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republicans say the size of Trump's election victory is why there is no potential unrest. He won the presidency by about 230,000 votes in the swing states and the popular vote by 1.5 percentage points after losing by about 44,000 votes in the swing states and 4.5 percentage points nationwide in 2020.",
      "\u201cThis time, I think the win was so decisive that it just \u2014 for good or ill depending on which side you\u2019re on \u2014 it\u2019s stifled most of that,\" said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican who led the objections on Jan. 6, 2021, over groundless allegations of voter fraud.",
      "Foley, author of the book \u201cBallot Battles\u201d about election challenges in U.S. history, advised Congress on changes to the law governing the joint session and its certification of the presidential election. He said he hoped the 2024 election marks the end of groundless challenges to congressional certification, even though the candidate who spearheaded the last challenge won.",
      "That's because Trump has said he won't run again and is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Foley noted that, in 2022, a number of Republicans tried to mimic Trump's distrust of election results and widely lost in swing states. Election denial, he said, may not be viable if not attached to Trump.",

    "summary": "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million month U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

    "story": [
      "New York\u2019s new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan is starting up after it withstood years of political wrangling, a last-minute pause and a flurry of legal challenges",
      "NEW YORK -- New York's new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours.",
      "The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been studying this issue for five years. And it only takes about five minutes if you\u2019re in midtown Manhattan to see that New York has a real traffic problem,\" Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber told reporters late Friday after a court hearing that cleared the way for the tolls.",
      "\"We need to make it easier for people who choose to drive, or who have to drive, to get around the city.\"",
      "The cost to drivers depends on what time of the day it is and if drivers have an E-ZPass, an electronic toll collection system that's used in many states.",
      "Most drivers with E-ZPasses will get dinged the $9 fee to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25.",
      "That's on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the program when he takes office, but it's unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review.",
      "In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing \u201cwill put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot only is this a massive tax to people coming in, it is extremely inconvenient from both driving and personal booking keeping standards,\" he said in a statement. \"It will be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.\u201d",
      "Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S.",
      "The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the city \u2014 the epicenter of opposition to the program \u2014 were considered to be vital to her party's effort to retake control of Congress.",
      "Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan but at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the program before halting it.",
      "Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. A spokesperson for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Natalie Hamilton, said in an email Saturday, that they would\" continue fighting against this unfair and unpopular scheme.\u201d",

      "By blocking a Japanese company\u2019s takeover of U.S. Steel, President Joe Biden says he is protecting good jobs in the American heartland",
      "WASHINGTON -- By blocking a Japanese company\u2019s takeover of U.S. Steel, President Joe Biden said he was protecting good jobs in the American heartland. He may be putting them at risk instead.",
      "In making its nearly $15 billion bid for the storied Pittsburgh-based steelmaker, Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel\u2019s aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania\u2019s Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval.",
      "\u201cThey were going to invest in the Valley,\u2019\u2019 said Jason Zugai, an operating technician and vice president of the United Steelworkers union local at a U.S. Steel plant in the Mon Valley. \u201cThey committed to 10 years of no layoffs. We won\u2019t have those commitments from anybody.\u2019\u2019",
      "Zugai and some other Mon Valley steelworkers supported the Nippon deal in defiance of the union\u2019s national leadership, which pressured the Biden administration to kill it.",
      "Losing the Nippon-U.S. Steel deal \u201cwill be a disaster for Pennsylvania,\u2019\u2019 said Gordon Johnson, who follows U.S. Steel stock on Wall Street as founder of GLJ Research. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand. This is not in the interest of the workers. It\u2019s not in the interest of the shareholders of U.S. Steel.\u2019\u2019",
      "On Friday, Biden said he was stopping the Nippon takeover \u2014 after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it \u2014 because \u201ca strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\u2019\u2019",
      "U.S. Steel stock dropped 6.5% on the news Friday.",
      "The decision, announced less than three weeks before the president leaves the White House, reflects a growing bipartisan shift away from free trade and open investment.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump had already come out against the Nippon takeover. \u201cAs President,\u201d he wrote last month on his Truth Social platform, \u201cI will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, Nippon and U.S. Steel called Biden\u2019s decision \u201ca clear violation of due process and the law\u2019\u2019 and suggested they would sue to salvage their deal: \u201cWe are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\u2019\u2019",
      "U.S. Steel was founded in 1901 in a merger that involved American business titans J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie and instantly created the largest company in the world. As the U.S. grew to world dominance in the 20th century, U.S. Steel grew with it. In 1943, at the height of the World War II manufacturing boom, U.S. Steel employed 340,000 people.",
      "But foreign competition \u2014 from Japan in the 1970s and \u201880s and later from China \u2014 gradually eroded U.S. Steel\u2019s position and forced it to close plants and lay off workers. The company now employs fewer than 22,000 in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "The U.S. government has sought over the years to protect U.S. Steel and other American steelmakers by imposing taxes on imported steel. During his first term, Trump slapped 25% tariffs on foreign steel, and Biden kept them or converted them into import quotas. Either way, the trade barriers kept the price of American steel artificially high, giving U.S. Steel and others a financial boost.",
      "U.S. Steel is profitable and is sitting on $1.8 billion in cash, though that is down from $2.9 billion at the end of 2023.",
      "United Steelworkers President David McCall declared Friday that U.S. Steel had the financial resources to go it alone. \u201cIt can easily remain a strong and resilient company,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters.",
      "But U.S. Steel has said it needs the cash from Nippon Steel to keep investing in blast furnaces like the ones in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "\u201cWithout the Nippon Steel transaction, U. S. Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist,\u2019\u2019 U.S. Steel warned in September. The company also threatened to move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "On its own, U.S. Steel seems poised to focus on newer electric arc furnaces, such as its Big River plant in Arkansas, which can make high-quality steel products more efficiently and at lower prices compared to blast furnaces, said Josh Spoores, the Pennsylvania-based head of steel Americas analysis for commodity researcher CRU.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if they don\u2019t have the will, but they seem to have seen that it\u2019s a much better investment, a much better rate of return if they look to invest in an electric arc furnace rather than a blast furnace,\u201d Spoores said. He noted that no steelmaker has built a blast furnace in North America for decades.",
      "One possibility is that another company will step in and make a bid for U.S. Steel.",
      "In 2023, arch-rival Cleveland-Cliffs offered to buy U.S. Steel for $7 billion. U.S. Steel turned the offer down and ended up accepting the nearly $15 billion all-cash offer from Nippon Steel, which is the deal that Biden nixed Friday. Perhaps, analysts say, Cleveland-Cliffs will try again.",
      "In a statement, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro warned U.S. Steel management against \u201cthreatening the jobs and livelihoods of the Pennsylvanians who work at the Mon Valley Works and at U.S. Steel HQ and their families.\u2019\u2019",
      "Shapiro also said companies that put in bids to buy U.S. Steel in the future must make the same commitments to \u201ccapital investment and protecting and growing Pennsylvania jobs that Nippon Steel placed on the table.\u2019\u2019",

      "The boss of US computer chip giant Nvidia has unveiled the firm's next-generation of gaming chips, known as the RTX 50-series.",
      "The announcement was part of Jensen Huang's keynote address at CES, an annual technology show in Las Vegas.",
      "The new family of chips will use Nvidia's Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) technology to create movie-quality images, he told a packed arena.",
      "The chips will range in price from $549 (\u00a3438) to $1,999, and are twice as fast as their predecessors, he added.",
      "Mr Huang carried out a real-time demonstration that showed off highly detailed graphics featuring an array of textures and manoeuvres.",

      "Thirty-one years later, Nvidia now stands at the forefront of the development of chips that power AI, with a market value of more than $3tn.",
      "However, Nvidia still faces some significant challenges, including from regulators around the world who have raised concerns about its growing dominance of the AI chip market.",
      "Last year, the company said it had been contacted by watchdogs in the US, UK, European Union, South Korea, and China."

      "In rejecting the proposed deal on Friday, President Biden said a strong domestically-owned steel industry was essential for national security and resilient supply chains, including for the car and defence industries.",
      "If the $14.9bn (\u00a311.8bn) takeover went ahead, it would strengthen Nippon's ability to compete with China, which produces 60% of the world's steel.",

      "Age UK says warming foods, like soup and stews, and hot drinks like tea can help keep you warm. People should try to have at least one hot meal a day and as many hot drinks as possible. Supermarket-branded tins may be cheaper, so keep a close eye on prices. Food banks can also help if you are short of money.",

      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "The Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",
      "The two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.",
      "But the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.",
      "The transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message.",
      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:04:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Financial problems at battery maker Northvolt have shaken hopes for Sweden's green industry sector.",
    "story": [
      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",
      "The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment.",

      "As the postmortem into the crisis continues, there are debates about the potential impact on Sweden's green ambitions.",
      "Northern Sweden, dubbed the \"Nordic Silicon Valley of sustainability\" by consultancy firm McKinsey, has swiftly gained global reputation for new industries designed to fast-track Europe's green transition.",
      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",
      "Headquartered in Malm\u00f6 in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups.",
      "Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant.",
      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:06:10 GMT",
    "summary": "While Trump eyes Greenland, Norway and Russia have put the brakes on their polar region investments.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic recently made headlines after Donald Trump repeated his desire to buy Greenland. Trump cited national security interests, but for many the territory's vast mineral wealth is the main attraction. Yet economic development elsewhere in the vast polar region has ground to a halt.",
      "Working conditions in the Arctic Ocean are extremely challenging at this time of the year for Norwegian fisherman Sondre Alnes-Bonesmo.",
      "The sun last rose at the end of October, and it is not due to appear in the sky again until the middle of February.",
      "In addition to the endless dark, temperatures can plummet below minus 40C, and storms can bring vast waves.",
      "Mr Alnes-Bonesmo, 30, works two six-hour shifts a day, during five-week tours on a ship called Granit. One of the largest factory trawlers fishing in Arctic waters north of Norway, and off the coast of Greenland, it doesn't stop for winter.",
      "Unsurprisingly, he prefers the endless daylight of summer. \"I do like it when the weather is nice, as we're not sent crashing into the walls and such, the way we are during storms, when the waves can be fairly big,\" he grins in understatement.",
      "Mr Alnes-Bonesmo is a participant in the so-called Arctic \"cold rush\".",
      "A play on words with gold rush, it began in earnest around 2008 when a series of reports identified vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves across the Arctic region. Reserves that, together with large fishing stocks, could continue to become more accessible as climate change reduces ice levels.",
      "This reduction in ice has also increasingly opened up Arctic sea routes, north of the Canadian mainland and Russia.",
      "So much so that, in the decade from 2013 to 2023, the total recorded annual distances sailed by ships in the Arctic Sea more than doubled from 6.1 million to 12.9 million miles.",
      "The hope in the longer term is that cargo ships can travel from Asia to Europe and the east coast of the US, through Arctic waters above Canada and Russia.",
      "But the question Mr Alnes-Bonesmo now asks himself is this \u2013 did he arrive too late?",
      "Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 much of the planned economic development of the Arctic region ground to a halt as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated.",
      "\"Russia had great plans in the Arctic,\" says Morten Mejlaender-Larsen, Arctic operation and technology director from Norwegian firm DNV. His company sets rules and standards for the maritime sector.",
      "\"They began constructing regional rescue centres complete with ships and helicopters to facilitate both destination shipping for gas, oil and coal projects in Siberia, as well as for shipping along the Northeast Passage [north of Russia].",
      "\"[But] since the invasion of Ukraine, international shipping in the Northeast passage has all but stopped, apart from a few Chinese ships,\" observes Mr Mejlaender-Larsen.",
      "He adds that Norway has also halted oil and gas exploration in the region. \"It's completely stopped,\" he says.",
      "\"We don't expect to see any further developments in the Barents Sea north of Bear Island.\" This small Norwegian island is some 400km (250 miles) north of Norway's mainland.",
      "Norway's scaled back ambitions in the Arctic have pleased environmentalists who have consistently warned about the impact of drilling for hydrocarbons on both wildlife and the fragile environment of the polar region.",
      "Last month Greenpeace welcomed the decision of the Norwegian government to stop the first round of licensing for deep sea mining in Arctic waters between Norway's Svalbard and Jan Mayen islands.",
      "Commentators say that while poor relations with Russia is a key reason why Norway is wary of ploughing money into Arctic projects, its interest in the polar region had already cooled.",
      "Helene Tofte, director of international cooperation and climate at the Norwegian Shipowners Association, says that in hindsight the outlook for shipping in the Arctic had been \"exaggerated\".",
      "She points out that despite the impact of climate change, the Arctic remains a difficult place in which to operate. \"Conditions in the Arctic can be extremely challenging, even when the absence of sea ice allows passage,\" she says.",
      "\"Large parts of the route are far from emergency response capacities, such as search and rescue, and environmental clean-up resources.",
      "\"Increased shipping in this area would require substantial investments in ships, emergency preparedness, infrastructure, and weather forecasting systems, for a route that is unpredictable and has a short operational season. At present, we have no indication that our members view this as commercially interesting.\"",
      "Mr Mejlaender-Larsen points to a \"belief that thanks to global warming there'll be summers up there. That'll never happen. If it's minus 40C and it gets 3C warmer, it's still not warm.\"",
      "Moreover, Prof Arild Moe, from Norwegian research group Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says the entire cold rush of the Arctic was based on exaggerated assumptions. \"The exuberance was excessive,\" says the expert on oil and gas exploration in the region.",
      "\"What the reports from 2008 referred to weren't actual reserves, but potential and highly uncertain resources, which would be risky, expensive, and difficult to locate and exploit.\"",
      "Regarding Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, authorities in Greenland and Denmark were again quick to reply that it was not for sale.",
      "Prof Moe says that Trump's \"crude and undiplomatic statement\" shows that the US under Trump eyes both security and economic interests in the island, including its \"rich mineral resources\".",
      "The Danish government also responded by announcing a huge increase in defence spending for Greenland.",
      "Elsewhere in the Arctic, Trump is expected to allow increased oil and gas exploration in Alaska, specifically in the resource rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
      "This 19 million acre expanse is the US's largest wildlife refuge, and back in 2020 Trump authorised drilling in one section of it.",
      "Meanwhile, Canada is continuing to build a deep-water port at Grays Bay, on the north coast of Nunavut, its most northern territory. Grays Bay is approximately in the centre of the so-called Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route north of the Canadian mainland.",
      "Back on the Granit fishing ship, Mr Alnes-Bonesmo says that, while he has earned good money, fishing quotas continue to go down to try to preserve stocks in Norwegian Arctic waters.",
      "Nevertheless, he is philosophical. \"After a few years at sea I've grown more scared of the Arctic Ocean, but I've also come to respect and value it for all its power and beauty.\""

      "For the new drilling ban, Biden is taking the action under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which allows US presidents to withdraw areas from mineral leasing and drilling.",
      "The law does not grant presidents the legal authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. It means a reversal would likely require an act of Congress, which is now controlled by Trump's Republicans.",
      "The law also does not allow presidents to revoke any areas already leased for offshore drilling.",
      "Trump - despite being in favour of more oil and gas exploration and repeatedly deploying his tag line \"Drill, baby, drill\" during campaigning - has used the law himself to protect waters off the coast of Florida in 2020.",
      "At the time, this was seen as an effort to garner votes from the state ahead of the 2020 US election, and the protection was due to expire in 2032. Biden's decision will protect the same area with no expiry date.",
      "The new offshore drilling ban covers more than 625 million acres (253 million hectares) of waters.",
      "After it was reported last week that Biden would introduce the policy, Trump's incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it \"a disgraceful decision\".",

And London Gatwick, the UK's second busiest airport, can facilitate a take-off or landing every 65 seconds.",
      "The spacing between arriving and departing aircraft was increased at London Gatwick last weekend during the fog, which Mr Calder estimates led to about 75,000 passengers being affected.",
      "Among them were James and Madison King, whose flight from Stockholm to London took a lengthy diversion because of the fog-related spacing limits.",
      "They were within touching distance of home when the pilot announced they did not have enough fuel for a 50-minute holding pattern at Gatwick, so the plane diverted to Dublin to refuel.

      "She saw thousands of people waiting in the terminal with nowhere to sit, and says it was \"grim\" having to wait 20 minutes to use the toilet because of the \"extreme overcrowding\".",
      "With upcoming warnings of snow, Mr Calder advises passengers to brace for more disruption to their flights because of spacing limits and runway closures.",
      "\"The UK has seen some shocking snow closures, where big airports have simply not been able to cope,\" he says, citing an incident in 2010 where hundreds of thousands of passengers saw cancellations at Heathrow because of snow.",
      "Snow also caused Manchester Airport to close both its runways in December 2022 and again in January 2023, with flights diverted as far away as Dublin and Paris.",
      "Although the extreme cost of disruption on this scale has led to British airports investing more in hardware and training to clear snow quicker, don't expect us to cope like airports in places such as Iceland and Greenland.",
      "Mr Calder says we might never be as good as other countries at keeping an efficient schedule in unusual weather.",
      "\"Historically the UK has had a benign climate,\" he says. \"Spending millions preparing for an unlikely event has been hard to justify.\"",
      "Disruption could grow",
      "There's not great news on the horizon because in the future, we can expect more disruption from weather related to climate change, says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate expert from the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"Aviation tends to be most impacted by extreme precipitation and stormy weather that makes flying unsafe - two weather types that are enhanced by higher temperatures,\" she says.",
      "She adds that climate heating increases the frequency and intensity of rain and snowfall events, making storms \"stronger and more frequent\" and increasing the frequency of aircraft turbulence.",
      "Nats, the national air traffic service, is allowed to take action to reduce the amount of planes in the sky and space them apart more during adverse weather under the Transport Act 2000.",
      "Given this is part of Nats' obligation to prioritise safety over all other factors, it doesn't have to compensate airlines for these restrictions - which in turn means airlines don't need to compensate passengers for the resulting delays either.",
      "The organisation told the BBC that it recognises there's a tough balancing act.",
      "\"Flow regulations are only ever employed when absolutely necessary and have to be expertly timed,\" a Nats spokesperson said.",
      "\"Unexpected additional or delayed air traffic can increase the pressure on controllers, particularly when the weather clears.",
      "\"If restrictions are lifted too early, they can risk an overpopulated airspace, while on the flip side, restrictions remaining in place longer than they need to can lead to unnecessary delays, which no one wants.\"",
      "This is brought into sharp focus during storms, Nats explained.",
      "\"Fundamentally, pilots don't want to fly through storms,\" it told the BBC.",
      "\"Although aircraft are robust, storms can still affect aircraft systems and excessive winds within unstable storm clouds make it much more difficult for aircraft to maintain their levels. It also increases turbulence, which negatively impacts passenger comfort.\"",
      "This leads to planes being in unexpected parts of the sky at different times, and all these new routes needing to be recalibrated to avoid any collisions.",
      "Nats says it does have measures to mitigate disruption, including specialist Met Office weather equipment which can help foresee the need for safety limits to be imposed, while pilots also have more tech on board to help them fly around bad weather patches and inform air traffic controllers of potential issues.",

      "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023.",

      "The Shenzhen-based firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million.",

      "BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota.",
      "It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options.",
      "Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.",
      "Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.",
      "Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.",
      "At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy.",
      "Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial.",
      "Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record.",

      "Some governments have stepped in to protect domestic companies.",
      "In October, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese-made EVs came into force across the trade bloc.",

      "BYD has still been expanding its foothold in emerging economies.",
      "But last month, it faced a setback in Brazil - its largest overseas market - with authorities halting the construction of a BYD factory, saying workers lived in conditions comparable to \"slavery\".",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 01:51:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says the rule change will raise \u00a3460m extra to spend in state schools in 2024/25.",
    "story": [
      "VAT is now being added to private school fees after new rules came into force on 1 January.",
      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Private schools say they have already seen a drop in secondary school pupil numbers because of higher fees.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "The government previously said the tax would apply to all payments made for the January term after 29 July 2024.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief from April 2025, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools.",
      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",
      "Some local authorities pay for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) to attend private schools.",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",
      "Campaigners had argued that VAT should not be added to fees for small faith schools, international schools or for families with children with special educational needs.",
      "But only those with a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names the specific school will continue to be exempt.",
      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "In October 2024, the organisation said it would press ahead with plans for a legal challenge against the policy. It argues the tax changes breach the European Convention on Human Rights on two counts: the prohibition of discrimination, and the right to education.",
      "The Treasury said it would not comment on potential litigation."

    "summary": "The Luton-born singer-songwriter has taken fourth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Rising pop star Myles Smith can still remember the first time he felt famous.",
      "\"This might sound trivial,\" says the singer, \"but I was playing a concert where I asked the audience, 'Does anyone have cookies?'",
      "\"And within about 10 minutes, the whole dressing room was full of cookies.",
      "\"It was the best thing ever.\"",
      "Since that gig, the 26-year-old's career has only grown bigger.",
      "Last year, he scored his first major hit with Stargazing, a feel-good foot-stomper that became the biggest-selling British single of 2024, and even featured on Barack Obama's end of year playlist.",
      "Now, he's been voted into fourth place on BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025, marking him out as one of the year's most promising new talents.",
      "And in March, he'll receive the Brit Awards' Rising Star prize \u2013 following in the footsteps of Sam Fender, Adele and Rag 'N' Bone Man.",
      "Smith confesses he learned about the accolade while in the grip of a ferocious hangover.",
      "\"The night before, I'd tried to go drink-for-drink with some people who were a lot more experienced than me, and we actually had to call a doctor to my Airbnb,\" he cringes.",
      "\"Finding out I'd got a Brit Award brought me back to life more than any vitamin C ever could.\"",
      "It was, he says \"the most LA I've ever felt\".",
      "It's certainly a long way from his upbringing in Luton.",
      "Born to a working class British-Jamaican family, he was a bright and happy kid, who grew up singing along to his mum's Motown records.",
      "His first true musical discovery was Coldplay's Yellow (\"it resonated with me, even though I didn't understand a word of it\") but Luton's social and cultural diversity meant he was exposed to hundreds of different genres.",
      "\"I went through a lot of stages,\" he says. \"I was a huge Green Day fan at one point. I even went through a bit of a Screamo phase.\"",
      "Before long, he was writing his own songs \u2013 initially by dreaming up melodies and lyrics to instrumentals he'd found on YouTube, then creating originals on a guitar he'd been given for his ninth birthday.",
      "\"I remember writing this song called Dream Girl, when I was 11,\" he says.",
      "\"It was about a girl at school, and it was bloody awful - but I sang it at school assembly anyway.",
      "\"Terrible decision. She realised it was about her and avoided me every day after that.\"",
      "Undeterred, he started playing at open mic nights around the city \u2013 covering artists like Ed Sheeran and Marcus Mumford while fine-tuning his distinctive folk-pop style.",
      "For a long time, however, music was a side hustle. After completing a sociology degree in 2019, Smith set up his own business, specialising in management and strategic development, and was turning a healthy profit by the time he was 23.",
      "\"I was quite comfortable,\" he says. \"But I understood quite early on that just because I'm good at something, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm passionate about it.\"",
      "He ploughed his earnings into studio sessions, recording an eight-track album called Scars in 2020. But it wasn't until his haunting cover of The Neighbourhood's Sweater Weather went viral in 2022 that he felt confident enough to pack in his day job.",
      "\"Money has never been the way I measure my success, but it was definitely scary,\" he says.",
      "\"It started off very much like plunging into an ice bath and feeling the shock. Like, 'OK, this is real. I don't have a consistent salary coming in, and I don't have the security of knowing how long this is going to take.'",
      "\"But it was a matter of switching mentality - so I wasn't looking at what securities I had lost, but what opportunities I'd gained.\"",
      "Any apprehension was short-lived.",
      "With a growing online fanbase, he started interspersing TikTok cover versions with snippets of originals.",
      "The one that made everyone pay attention was Solo \u2013 whose devious wordplay was so obviously memorable (\"Why'd you get me so high/ To leave me solo\") you couldn't quite believe no-one had thought of it before.",
      "Released independently in 2023, it earned Smith his first UK chart hit and, subsequently, a deal with RCA Records.",
      "But he continued to build his audience organically, gigging constantly while posting on TikTok and YouTube.",
      "He's got an interesting take on social media. While artists like Halsey and Florence Welch have expressed frustration at record label pressure to create viral videos,  Smith calls TikTok a \"meritocratic system\" that rewards the effort you put in.",
      "\"There's a difference between the chase for virality and building an audience,\" he reasons.",
      "\"If your objective is to go viral, then you're always going to be fighting a losing battle. But if your objective is to establish a community and a place where your music belongs, it becomes a lot more rewarding.\"",
      "When he's not sharing music, there's a thoughtful tone to his social posts. In one recent note, he addressed people who said his music had \"saved their lives\".",
      "\"I need you to know, it wasn't my music, it was you,\" he wrote. \"I know this because I've been where you are. I've clung to songs in the dark searching for something \u2013 anything \u2013 that made me feel like I could keep going.",
      "\"But music didn't save me. What saved me was the smallest part of me that chose to stay, even when it hurt.",
      "\"My songs might walk beside you, but it's your strength that carries you forward.\"",
      "That empathy is baked into Smith's lyrics. His most affecting songs, such as River and Wait For You, are covenants of support for a friend who's drowning in their troubles.",
      "His breakout hit, Stargazing, is also about a moment of human connection \u2013 looking into the cosmos and realising \"the person we fall in love with has been there our whole life\".",
      "He's previously claimed the track was inspired by a sunset in Malibu, but it turns out that that's a little white lie.",
      "Smith actually came up with the folky, clap-along chorus and its central lyric (\"You and I stargazing/ Intertwining souls\") while eating tacos and salsa with his co-writers, Peter Fenn and Jesse Fink, early last year.",
      "They were so inspired that they demo'd the song in just 15 minutes \u2013 just as the sun was setting over Malibu.",
      "\"Somehow, that moment gave the lyric a meaning,\" says the singer. \"It was an afterthought, but it was a very beneficial afterthought.\"",
      "He started posting snippets of the song online almost immediately, and \"from the very first post, the reaction was explosive\".",
      "There was only one problem: they hadn't finished the verses.",
      "For a month, they frantically traded voice notes and Zoom calls, pulling the song into focus in time for a May release. Since then, it's been streamed more than 600 million times.",
      "\"It's quite wild,\" says the singer. \"It's still getting played, seven or eight months down the line, which is awesome.\"",
      "Smith ended 2024 with a clutch of honours \u2013 from his first Brit Award, to being named BBC Introducing's Artist Of The Year \u2013 and the release of his new EP, \u2026A Minute.",
      "At the start of 2025, he's juggling writing sessions for his debut album with a hectic touring schedule that sees him playing 36 shows in 60 days in 16 countries. But if that sounds daunting, he's prepared.",
      "\"It's a lot, for sure, but I used to stand on the edge of my sofa and pretend I was at Glastonbury. So being able to tour, at whatever scale, is just such a privilege that it doesn't feel like hard work.\"",
      "What's more, he's guaranteed to get free cookies."

      "Having adopted the drag name The Vivienne because of a love for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing, her weekly outfits on the catwalk were second to none.",
      "On the show, she described her drag style as being \"like a Scouse wife who has come into money, she moved to LA and blew it all and then she's had to move back to Liverpool\".",
      "Without a contour line out of place and a perfected walk in stilettos, she wooed the judges with her bold, glitzy and saucy looks.",
      "Her 'Queen Elizabeth walking around Balmoral' outfit, which saw her wear a gold poncho and grey knitted skirt with fluffy ducks attached to it, was one of her most memorable.",
      "Combine that with her doing the floss dance in the outfit and she had viewers, fellow contestants and even RuPaul crying with laughter.",

      "They got well on their way last year. In September, the band beat pop stars like Charli XCX and CMAT to win the Mercury Prize for their debut album, This Could Be Texas.",
      "The record deals in sharp portraits of life in sleepy northern towns, where the background hum of racism, loneliness and deprivation is thrown into sharp relief by sublime scenery and lifelong friendships.",

      "\"I wrote my first song for the audition,\" she recalls. \"It was awful, but it worked. I got a place to study singing and performance, but I very quickly switched to composition, because I was suddenly spending all my time writing songs.\"",

      "During that period, English Teacher's members \u2013 completed by drummer Douglas Frost and bassist Nicholas Eden \u2013 circled each other on Leeds' live music scene, playing with various other bands before settling on their current line-up.",
      "Their breakthrough came with 2021's R&B, their official debut single, where Fontaine addresses the challenge of being a woman of colour fronting an indie band: (\"Despite appearances, I haven't got the voice for R&B\").",
      "It's a perception she struggled with herself as a teenager, frustrated that she wasn't capable of \"the kind of the vocal runs that the black singers I looked up to were able to do\".",
      "As a frontwoman, she developed her own style \u2013 a droll mixture of sprechgesang and her fluttering, airy upper register. But she still encountered prejudice.",
      "\"There'd be times where I told people that I made music, and they'd give a certain expression when I said that it was guitar music or it was indie music,\" she says.",
      "\"There were a lot of small comments after gigs. People would come up and say, 'Oh, that's not what I was expecting at all',\" adds Whiting.",
      "Fontaine is careful not to make too big an issue of it. \"I think I've got a lot of privilege, because I'm quite a light skinned woman of colour,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if I was dark skinned it would be even harder - but it did affect me, not seeing people who looked like me in bands.",
      "\"I think it made me start a band later in life. Maybe I would have started when I was a teenager, and not when I was leaving university.\"",
      "English Teacher's early songs gained an audience during the first wave of the Covid pandemic \u2013 which meant they didn't get to play a gig together until the lockdown ended.",
      "Their first show was as part of an all-day mini festival in May 2021, where the audience still had to be seated and socially distanced.",
      "\"Those first gigs were kind of jarring,\" Whiting recalls. \"It was quite strange because everything up 'til then felt very online, which doesn't feel as tangible. And then when you go and play a gig, it's like, 'Yeah, this is actually going somewhere.'\"",
      "\"We were so nervous, too,\" says Fontaine. \"I feel like it was only late into 2023 that we really found our confidence.\"",
      "By that point, they were deep into recording their debut album with Italian producer Marta Salogni (Bjork, Depeche Mode, MIA) \u2013 including new, more polished versions of R&B and The World's Biggest Paving Slab.",
      "The band say they put \"immense pressure\" on themselves to perfect the record, fixating on its push-pull dynamics, adding extra layers of context, and experimenting with new instruments.",
      "\"It was an intense time in our personal lives, trying to get it finished and out. We gave a lot to it,\" says Whiting.",
      "\"Recording your first album is just a huge opportunity,\" continues Fontaine. \"I think we were very aware of that.\"",
      "The hard work paid off.",
      "Record Collector Magazine called This Could Be Texas \"one of the most confident and charismatic debuts in years\". The Mercury Prize judges said the band's \"winning lyrical mix of surrealism and social observation... displays a fresh approach to the traditional guitar band format\".",
      "The quartet are endearingly amazed that anyone paid attention at all.",
      "\"I wasn't sure that it would connect with people, because the lyrics are quite specific to the area I grew up in,\" says Fontaine.",
      "Instead, it was the bigger themes \u2013 of leaving home and finding your place in a world that's \"going up in flames\" \u2013 that helped them find an ever-growing audience.",
      "On The World's Biggest Paving Slab, Fontaine mockingly describes herself as \"the world's smallest celebrity\" \u2013 a lyric that's rapidly becoming obsolete.",
      "\"I'm not the smallest, but certainly not the biggest,\" she laughs.",
      "\"In the alphabet of celebrity, I'm probably on the X-list.\"",
      "One act from the BBC Sound of 2025 top five will be revealed on Radio 1 and BBC News every day this week, culminating with the winner on Friday."

    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "Plot twists are happening already in season three of the BBC's The Traitors, as one contestant from London lifted the lid on her charming - but false - Welsh accent.",
      "Charlotte, 33, has lived in London her whole life but has decided to pretend she is from Abergavenny, in Monmouthshire, to maximise her chances of survival.",
      "\"I've been putting on a Welsh accent because my mum's from Wales, it's one of the most trustworthy accents,\" she told the camera on New Year's Day.",
      "But is a Welsh lilt really the key to gaining people's trust as a faithful in the show - and perhaps in life in general?",
      "Winkleman: 'New twists have turned The Traitors on its head'",
      "Banished Traitors star: 'I was out of my depth'",
      "Is commuting changing Welsh accents?",
      "The reality show centres around traitors selected by host Claudia Winkleman, who must deceive and gain the trust of other contestants, who are faithfuls.",
      "Dr Mercedes Durham, a sociolinguistics professor at Cardiff University, led research into the likeability of the Welsh accent and found people associate the accent with being friendly - but not necessarily clever.",
      "\"They genuinely appreciated it, they find it funny, attractive and friendly, but they didn't take it seriously or associate it with intelligence,\" said Dr Durham.",
      "But friendliness and trustworthiness are linked, says Dr Durham, so there could be a method behind the mask.",
      "Inspiration may have come from previous Welsh contestants Andrew Jenkins from Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Amanda Lovett, from Swansea, who both eliminated faithfuls and narrowly missed out on The Traitors trophy in series one and two.",
      "Amanda sailed through the first series in 2023, with her opponents swearing hand on heart that the humble character could never be a traitor.",
      "\"I think the Welsh accent is very relaxing, it definitely played a role in people trusting me in being a motherly figure,\" said Amanda.",
      "\"Maybe they didn't think I would be sharp enough, or the type capable of murdering, that I was too naive maybe,\" she added.",
      "\"But I don't know if I agree with pinching our Welsh accent,\" Amanda laughed, \"we are very proud of our Welsh heritage\".",
      "Amanda said Traitors fans may even be wary of Welsh contestants this time, as both her and Andrew took their charming accents to the very end.",
      "Andrew agreed the Welsh accent is trustworthy, but said he would have spotted Charlotte's fake effort from a mile off.",
      "\"Oh, I think it's terrible, she keeps dipping in and out of her London accent,\" he said.",
      "\"I just think the Welsh are lovely, friendly, trusting people, I went in and was authentic.",
      "\"I tried to make as many friends as I could and be myself to be honest, I think that helped.\"",
      "Charlotte is not the only Welsh person in the game this year, as Cardiff-based Elen is from north Wales and Leanne is from Holywell in Flintshire.",
      "There is a lot of variation in Welsh accents, and people tend to relate more to certain regions, according to Dr Durham.",
      "\"The main association of people outside of Wales is the south Wales valleys and Barry Island in the Vale of Glamorgan, thanks to Gavin & Stacey,\" she said.",
      "\"Possibly more than the other two contestants, it's an accent outsiders will associate the most with Wales.\"",
      "The Welsh accent has enticed new contact centres to set up or expand in Wales in recent years, including Starling Bank, Capital on Tap, Veezu and TCH Group.",
      "One firm chose Newport, over Middlesbrough, Teesside, to open its funeral planning business, because of the \"consoling\" and \"empathetic\" Welsh accent.",
      "Sandra Busby, chief executive of Cnect Wales, which supports contact centres, said Wales has always been an attractive location for many reasons with accents \"playing their part\".",
      "\"Over the years the Welsh accent always comes in the top three regional accent surveys for friendliness and for being trustworthy,\" she added.",
      "What accents rival the Welsh one?",
      "The Welsh accent took top spot for the most relaxing accent across the UK in 2024, in a study by the University of Sheffield and Spa Seekers.",
      "The public have a soft spot for all Celtic accents, Irish and Scottish included, thanks to their friendly connotations, said Dr Durham.",
      "Received pronunciation, also known as Queen's English, does well to gain people's trust, but mainly because of its social prestige.",
      "But Birmingham, Liverpudlian and Cockney accents are often not favoured and can be found in the lower half of popularity polls.",
      "Trust in accents can change over time depending on our social circles and daily relationships, according to a study by Ilaria Torre from Plymouth University.",
      "Participants heard either a standard southern English accent or a \"lesser trusted\" Liverpudlian accent, and attitudes changed depending on first impressions and judgements.",
      "If a person who spoke in a \"trusted\" accent went on to behave fairly, then this first impression of trustworthiness increased.",
      "Yet if they went on to behave unfairly, they were seen as less trustworthy than those who had both a lesser trusted accent and behaviour.",
      "Participants \"were punishing them, so to speak, for not living up to the participants' expectations\", said Ms Torre.",
      "On the opposite side, those who were seen as sounding \"untrustworthy\" with a Liverpudlian accent but acted nicely were able to reverse negative preconceptions.",
      "So, while a Welsh lilt might start you off in good stead as a trusted contestant, the odds are still all to play for.",
      "With a mixture of different accents from across the UK, how will the Welsh ones do?",
      "You can find out - the first three episodes of The Traitors are now on BBC iPlayer, and the series airs on BBC One at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",
      "How well do you know these Welsh accents?",

      "\"You probably won't find too many Neil Young performances available freely on TV or online,\" he added. \"He generally prefers the audience to find his albums.\"",
      "In his initial post on Tuesday, the star lashed out at what he described as the BBC's \"corporate control\" of Glastonbury, and said the festival \"is not the way I remember it being\".",
      "Artists are not forced to hand over broadcast rights when they play the event, and often contracts are signed at the last minute.",
      "Asked for a response to Young's latest statement, the BBC said: \"There's always great excitement about Glastonbury's bookings and who will appear at the legendary festival. We'll talk more about our broadcast plans as the line-up shapes up.\""

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:50:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Being the UK's new City of Culture is a chance for Bradford to challenge prejudices against the city.",
    "story": [
      "As Bradford begins its year as UK City of Culture, it is not just trying to show a different face to the rest of the country - it's also hoping to win over doubters in the city.",
      "One of the first productions is a radio play written by broadcaster Nick Ahad, and its theme is Bradford's battered reputation.",
      "\"The working title for this play was 'Bradford, City of Culture?!' because we knew that's what the reaction would be when people found out we would be the City of Culture for 2025,\" he explains.",
      "Ahad eventually settled on the excellent title Bilal and Ted's Bradfordian Adventure, and it's on BBC Sounds. One of the actors is Seeta Wrightson, a comedian from the city.",
      "\"I think it's really unfairly got a bad rep. And I think that's because in the news or on social media, people don't want to talk about good things.\"",
      "'Why is Bradford so\u2026?'",
      "Wrightson's not wrong.",
      "The headlines about Bradford are often brutal. In recent months, news stories have declared it Britain's gloomiest city (because it has the least sunshine) and the second most miserable place to live.",
      "Type the words \"Why is Bradford so\u2026.?\" into a search engine and see what happens.  The odds are you will probably get the following autofill options - \"bad\", \"dangerous\" and \"poor\".",
      "And it's not just the opinions of people outside the city. Dr Paul Sullivan of Bradford University has carried out research into the stigma. His hometown is Ireland's Cork, a place where its comedians make fun of its high opinion of itself. Bradford, he discovered, was rather different.",
      "\"What surprised me was... the almost lack of civic pride.",
      "\"Even reading the local newspaper, some of the headlines can be very upbeat, and beneath it are just loads of comments that, 'This is a disaster, it'll just never work, Bradford is doomed'.\"",
      "But Dr Sullivan is a fan.",
      "\"I love the city. I fell in love with Bradford straight away. I love the city centre, the beautiful countryside.  And it was really quite a surprise to me to see that level of negativity.\"",
      "Much of it, he believes, is rooted in an external and almost \"ideological hostility\" to the city's ethnic diversity.",
      "\"I think there's a reluctance to admit that Bradford can succeed. A desire for Bradford to fail.\"",
      "However, in the face of this antagonism, something is, he feels, developing.",
      "In his recent interviews with residents, \"there was a real sense of pride, in their sense of belonging\".",
      "It was a topic Ahad and Wrightson also raised. Diversity has become utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I'm Bangladeshi and English. My wife's Pakistani and Indian, and you sort of don't have to explain here,\" says Ahad.",
      "\"Like 100%,\" Wrightson adds. \"I'm mixed heritage, my mum's Indian, my dad's English. And growing up, it wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "City of Culture has for many become a moment to look beyond the problems and champion what's growing out of its diversity.",
      "People feel welcomed",
      "Natalie Davies, an actor and writer from Bradford, is creating a play about the city's nightlife.",
      "\"The stigma that's been attached for years is old now, and that's not what Bradford is.",
      "\"I'm very lucky. I've worked in television, I've worked in film, I've worked in theatre and radio, and every time I go on to a set, I always champion Bradford.",
      "\"This is actually a great place, and the thing about it is anybody from anywhere could come to Bradford and feel like they belong and we hold that. People come and completely feel welcomed.",
      "\"It's beautiful.\"",
      "City of Culture has also been a chance for people to take stock of Bradford's cultural history and the famous names that have come from here.",
      "Among them are artist David Hockney, playwright JB Priestley, composer Delius and the Bronte sisters.",
      "\"Emily Bronte, you just take it for granted that she's from Bradford,\" says Wrightson.",
      "For her, City of Culture has been a moment to look at what makes the city special.  And again and again, talking to younger Bradfordians, while some might mention the Brontes, the spectacular Victorian architecture, the first free school meals or the diversity - almost everyone seems to agree that the city's food is key.",
      "Of course, no two people ever seem to agree as to where you can get the best curry, but perhaps one of the best known restaurants is Akbar's, famous for the creation of the giant hanging naan.",
      "Created to save space on a table, the family naan grew to a size that has defeated even the largest Yorkshire appetite.",
      "\"People have tried. None have succeeded,\" says Samad Iqbal, who started working at Akbar's aged 15 and is a proud ambassador for a city that describes itself as the Capital of Curry.",
      "\"Some people call it elephant ears. Some people call it a Christmas tree. But this family naan has gone worldwide.",
      "\"I am very proud of Bradford, I'm born and bred here. It's a fantastic place to live, a fantastic place to eat. It's places like this which show the true spirit of Bradford.\"",
      "It appears Bradford 2025 has already begun to have an effect. It has, says Dr Sullivan, encouraged people to talk positively about the city.",
      "\"In the last couple of years we have seen a change. I am speaking from opinion here now rather than research, but I think we have seen a shift towards civic pride, and I think the catalyst for that really coming to fruition will be Bradford 2025.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 08:46:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The show has returned to our screens for a third series, but with a few key changes to the format.",
    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",
      "Format changes",
      "Several tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.",
      "One early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness.",
      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

      "What is happening in Northampton and Kettering is symptomatic of cinema closures across the UK, but there are also new sites and operators opening.",
      "So what is the state of play within the cinema industry?",
      "What cinemas have been closing?",
      "The Point in Milton Keynes was one of the UK's first multiplex cinemas when it opened in 1985. The site showed its last film in 2015, and last year it was saved from demolition.",
      "The city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.",
      "But during the pandemic, cinema chains began to suffer as screens were closed for several months. When they reopened, there were drops in both the number of films and audiences.",
      "In 2023, both Empire Cinemas and Cineworld went into administration.",
      "Irish chain Omniplex bought five of the Empire Cinema sites. It then announced it would close the cinema in Ipswich, but that decision was later reversed.",
      "Cineworld was unable to find a buyer and instead last year announced that a number of sites would close, including in Bedford.",
      "Last month the company announced a further six sites would close \u2013 including in Northampton \u2013 and said it would pull out of a leisure centre in Colchester.",
      "The site in Northampton will be converted into an Odeon. That operator also recently opened a site in Peterborough.",
      "But the Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month after the landlord said it was no longer viable.",
      "Why have cinemas been closing?",
      "Despite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.",
      "\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.",
      "\"The recovery has completely stalled and that is to do with the release calendar, which was impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\"",
      "In 2023, both writers and actors in the United States took industrial action, which halted the production of several major films and delayed their release.",
      "\"We haven't had consistent releases of big tentpole films until we got to November,\" says Mr Gant.",
      "Richard Clifford, programmer at the two-screen Northampton Filmhouse, agrees and says 2024 was \"a challenging year in general for the industry\".",
      "He says the November releases of Gladiator II, Wicked, and Paddington in Peru \"certainly helped every cinema around the world\".",
      "Mr Clifford, who has also worked for Cineworld and Vue, adds that audiences \"haven't seen the wider range of films\" with fewer documentaries, British films and foreign films released.",
      "Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"",
      "Some of those will be reopened by other operators, he says, \"but inevitably it will mean that some communities lose their local cinema, [which] really does have an impact\".",
      "Is smaller the future?",
      "Mr Gant says cinemas face rising costs as many industries do, in particular with energy and staffing.",
      "\"They are large buildings and some of them are probably not built in the most energy-efficient manner,\" he says.",
      "\"Some of the stuff that got built in the 1990s are these of out-of-town sheds.\"",
      "But new cinemas are opening and Mr Clapp says operators recognise they need to \"offer something more than people would get at home\".",
      "\"The general trend is to more reclining sofas [and] a more upscale experience, and part of that is a move away from the large auditoriums with hundreds of seats,\" he says.",
      "He adds that rather than looking only at capacity, cinemas want to increase occupancy or, \"put simply, bums on seats\".",
      "\"That's the general direction of travel for many in the UK cinema sector and indeed in European and global cinemas,\" he says.",
      "But he adds: \"There is an audience out there still for the big-screen experience.\"",
      "Mr Clifford says a smaller venue such as Northampton Filmhouse \u2013 which has two screens, each with a capacity of about 90 \u2013 can have \"a different kind of audience that comes on a regular basis\".",
      "\"They come here so regularly. They come and see everything we put on,\" he says.",
      "Will 2025 be better for cinemas?",
      "Mr Clapp says 2025 looks \"something like the normal film slate\" for large studio films.",
      "\"What still needs to build back is the next tier and more diverse films \u2013 the films that appeal to a broader audience than [the] mainstream blockbusters,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "When I meet Willem Dafoe on Zoom to discuss his latest movie Nosferatu, we get on to mortality fast.",
      "The four-time Oscar-nominated actor is talking to me for Radio 4's Today programme about Robert Eggers' remake of the 1922 silent film of the same name, which was an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.",
      "Nosferatu is the tale of a terrifying vampire who is infatuated with a haunted young woman called Ellen, played by Lily-Rose Depp.",
      "The story that unfolds involves a lot of death. Where creatures that feed on human blood are concerned, that's pretty standard. But Dafoe, who plays a vampire-hunting professor of the occult in the film, tells me in real life too \"we're all somewhere considering death all the time\".",
      "For him, that's one explanation for the popularity of vampire stories.",
      "Bram Stoker's novel Dracula has been adapted numerous times, and vampires in general are never far from our screens.",
      "Dafoe rationalises the enduring appeal of the subgenre like this: \"It's a very interesting proposition to have the undead visit the living, and it becomes something of a meditation of the dark side of things versus the light\".",
      "Even if we don't know it, he muses, all of us are always addressing this type of conflict in some form.",
      "An interview with Dafoe is never dull; he's a thoughtful and intelligent actor, who, for the best part of 50 years, has combined big Hollywood successes (Spiderman movies, John Wick, Born on the Fourth of July) with the arthouse films he relishes.",
      "He dropped out of university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to join an experimental theatre company but, since those early days, his voracious work ethic and intense appeal as perhaps the greatest living character actor have seen him in more than 130 films. His debut, Heaven's Gate, was in 1980. Seven years later, he was first nominated for an Oscar for the Vietnam war film Platoon.",
      "Dafoe was crucified as Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ and cut off his ear as Van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate. He spent six hours a day in the prosthetics make-up chair to morph into a reclusive scientist in Poor Things, and he has even been a version of a vampire himself, in Shadow of the Vampire.",
      "While the original 1922 silent movie by F.W. Murnau pioneered some early special effects, including superimposing the image of Nosferatu on to a ship to create a frightening ghostly glow, Eggers goes for an earthy take, grounded in history and reality.",
      "There were 2,000 real live rats on set.",
      "It's perfect for Dafoe, who tells me he doesn't like to work too much with computer-generated imagery (the green screen and other visual effects that have become integral to filmmaking).",
      "\"You need to earn the authority to pretend, and through the technology, that gets lost\".",
      "Don't expect well-trodden vampire movie fare in this Nosferatu. Count Orlok doesn't have the symmetrical fanged teeth we're used to. This vampire isn't a suave seducer in a high-collared black cloak.",
      "Dafoe says Eggers wanted to get back to \"a time when people actually believed in vampires\". To do this, \"he went for a much more folk-based vampire\".",
      "The actor believes this is \"why this Orlok in the movie is so very different to anything we've ever seen before\".",
      "The film is packed with talent popular with Gen Z (Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin). The cast - and the status of the 1922 original in the film firmament - means Eggers' movie had achieved a cult-like following even before its release.",
      "In the US, that was on Christmas Day. I asked whether Dafoe thought a movie about a bloodsucking, diseased creature and the horror he unleashes on a 19th Century German town was the perfect antidote to a day of family festivities.",
      "He pointed to \"the shadow side\" of these occasions, \"a time when some people fall into depression because they fall out of that happiness\".",
      "It's true that his film work offers up both sides - the joy and the pain of life, the extremes of being human and everything in-between.",
      "He tells me that if you don't recognise there is a shadow side to life, \"you're going to become a victim of it some day\".",
      "As I look at him on the computer screen, it's impossible not to reflect on how expressive his face is - a face that could be carved from the earth.",
      "He tells me he only realised it when he started being photographed on the red carpet.",
      "\"Man, they get some ugly pictures of me. They get some grotesque pictures and they get some nice pictures\".",
      "He puts that down to his face having \"range\".",
      "\"I never think about my face,\" he goes on. \"If I ever do, it's really just to tell it to calm down\".",

      "Separate to this investigation, we have spoken to the family of a patient who allege they were \"lied\" to by a senior surgeon in the trust's general surgery department, before he carried out an operation that left her with life-threatening injuries.",
      "Wendy Gibbs, 80, had been due to be operated on by Marc Lamah to repair a pelvic prolapse at a private hospital in Brighton, run by Nuffield Health. But the surgeon told her he wanted to switch the procedure to a different Nuffield hospital because the Brighton site didn't have a specific type of scanner that he would need. The machine, it turned out, was also not available at the second hospital.",
      "Mr Lamah also failed to disclose to Mrs Gibbs that he, and other surgeons, were prevented from carrying out such operations in Brighton at the time, as Nuffield Health had suspended that type of surgery over safety concerns.",

He was operated on by a neurosurgeon named Carl Hardwidge, who spent 31 years working at the trust before leaving in 2023. He has been criticised by the family of Mr Coles, who died in 2021 after being operated on by Mr Hardwidge to remove a brain tumour.",

    "title": "Child mental health crisis: Better resilience is the solution, say experts",
    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 02:50:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The surge in mental health referrals among young people has prompted debate among experts about the cause - and the most effective solution",
    "story": [
      "Jane Graham has been a school nurse for nearly 20 years \u2013 and during this time the nature of her work has completely changed. \"When I started, the majority of the support we provided was for physical health, like asthma, allergic reactions and injuries,\" she says. \"Now it's mental health.\"",
      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",
      "GPs, youth workers and social workers I have spoken to shared similar stories, with many pointing out that mental health cases in the young are rising in ever greater numbers.",
      "One in five children and young people between the ages of eight and 25 in England are now thought to have a mental health disorder, according to official figures. Unsurprisingly, the NHS is struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

      "Currently, only 59% of patients meet the 18-week target, with three million people waiting longer.",
      "The new promise is to reach 65% by March 2026, which, according to the government, would reduce the backlog by more than 450,000.",

      "They will provide up to half a million extra appointments each year, officials say.",
      "And where appropriate, GPs will be able to refer patients directly to these centres, without a prior consultation with a specialist doctor.",
      "More surgical hubs will also be created to focus on common, less complex procedures, such as cataract surgeries and some orthopaedic work.",
      "These hubs are ring-fenced from other parts of the hospital, to ensure operating-theatre time is not lost if there are emergency cases.",
      "The new plan also says abolishing automatic review appointments after treatment, offering them instead only to patients who request them, will free up a million appointments every year for patients who really need them.",
      "And officials say these extra appointments will be in addition to the two million a year - or 40,000 a week - above the normal annual total of more than 100 million, that Labour promised, before the election, to create within a year.",

      "Plans for patients to use the NHS App to monitor and book consultations and test results, with greater control over where they are treated, have already been announced.",

      "NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: \"The radical reforms in this plan will not only allow us to deliver millions more tests, appointments and operations but do things differently too \u2013 boosting convenience and putting more power in the hands of patients, especially through the NHS App.\"",
      "The overall waiting list for NHS appointments, procedures, and surgeries in England stands at just under 7.5 million.",

      "When you think of new year's resolutions, a 75-day workout might not top the list.",
      "But that's what's going viral this year as people take to TikTok to document their progress.",
      "First, the ground rules: you stick to a healthy diet with no cheat meals or alcohol.",
      "Plus on each of the 75 days, you do two 45-minute workouts, one of them outside, drink more than three litres of water and read 10 pages of a non-fiction book.",
      "Easy, right? Well in case you fancy your chances, two people who have finished the challenge told us what it's really like - and experts have cautioned that if it sounds a bit strict, something more relaxed might work better for you.",
      "'New areas for me to tackle'",
      "Meet 29-year-old Devamsha Gunput, who completed 75 Hard last March whilst working full-time as a digital consultant for a large corporation.",
      "\"It was definitely hard,\" she tells the BBC. \"Also living in Edinburgh, it was dark, wet and cold and you had to do one of the workouts outside.\"",
      "Devamsha says one of the most challenging aspects of 75 Hard was \"setting boundaries\" when visiting her South Asian family so that she could be strict with her diet.",
      "\"Having to exercise twice a day and be strict on my diet were really uncomfortable and new areas for me to tackle, because I hadn't had that conversation before,\" she says.",
      "But since completing the challenge, she's noticing the lasting impacts so far.",
      "\"I exercise a lot more regularly, my reading habits and my relationship with food have transformed,\" she says.",
      "While 75 Hard has turned into a viral craze over the last few weeks, it was actually invented back in 2019 by author and podcaster Andy Frisella.",
      "He said on his podcast that he's spent \"20 years figuring out how to master mental toughness\" and has used this knowledge to create the plan.",
      "He is not a qualified personal trainer or doctor and does not give guidance over what classifies as a healthy diet in the plan, but it's understood to mean balanced and nutrient-rich.",

      "She overhauled her diet, cutting out chocolate and sweets but allowing for anything with naturally occurring sugar, like fruit and honey.",
      "Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.",
      "She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.",
      "To solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"",
      "Since completing it, she's stuck to some part of the plan such as not eating out or buying unnecessary coffees and cakes, helping her \"save so much money\".",
      "\"But the biggest thing is probably a mindset shift - the encouragement I got from knowing I can do it, the excuses about time and self-doubt are all gone,\" she says.",
      "Pros and cons of the challenge",
      "But the challenge isn't for everyone, which is something strength and conditioning coach Tana von Zitzewitz wants those who are considering it to bear in mind.",
      "\"You need a lot of time, not only for the workouts, but for reading the book - it seems a lot to try and cram into one day,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I definitely think there are elements people can implement, committing to 45 minutes of daily movement, being conscious of drinking more water and reducing screen time, but you need to be aware of what's involved,\" Tana adds.",
      "Another aspect is motivation. \"There is so much pressure for people to transform their lives at this time of year,\" she says.",
      "She suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.",
      "From a medical perspective, it is difficult to determine whether 75 Hard is beneficial.",
      "NHS GP Sam Whiteman points out that, because \"it has not been studied\" in a clinical setting, it cannot claim to change your life in any way.",
      "He also says that it would need to be compared to a more basic regime, to see if that could achieve the same results.",
      "\"If it's a way for people to get out and be active then I am all for it, but if it's a question of whether this is better than going to the gym three times a week or going for a run once a week and eating healthily, then I am not sure,\" he adds.",
      "Hitting certain criteria isn't the intention of 75 Hard's founder, Mr Frisella. He doesn't set any rules that involve losing a certain amount of weight, for example.",
      "While the challenge encourages people to take progress pictures each day, much of the TikTok content around it focuses on how the person feels at the end rather than how they look, helping to avoid unhealthy fixations with appearance.",

      "Announcing the plan, he said the move would shift the NHS \"into the digital age\" and help cut waiting times \"from 18 months to 18 weeks\".",
      "The app would \"put patients in the driving seat and treat them on time\", and they would be \"put in control of their own healthcare\", the health secretary said.",

      "Other plans include expanding a scheme for GPs to discuss some cases with\u00a0 hospital specialists before making referrals to ensure patients are treated in the right setting.",
      "The current Advice and Guidance Scheme has resulted in 50% of cases being directed to more appropriate care rather than being put on long waiting lists and so reducing pressure on hospitals. These include some ear, nose and throat conditions.",
      "GPs will also be able to refer patients with certain conditions directly for tests or scans without the need to see a consultant first. The aim is to reduce waiting times and remove those who are given the all clear from waiting lists.",
      "Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said using technology would revolutionise access to healthcare and put \"patients in the driving seat of elective care\".",

      "Prof Jay's report into the Rotherham cases said the police would often cite the CPS as being unwilling to prosecute alleged perpetrators, but they said that it had been \"much more helpful\" later on.",
      "A 2013 report from the Home Affairs Committee said that \"unlike many other official agencies implicated in this issue\", the CPS had \"readily admitted that victims had been let down by them and have attempted both to discover the cause of this systematic failure and to improve the way things are done so as to avoid a repetition of such events\".",
      "It added: \"Mr Starmer has striven to improve the treatment of victims of sexual assault within the criminal justice system throughout his term as Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).\"",
      "Maggie Oliver, a former Manchester detective who now campaigns for victims of child sex abuse, told BBC Verify that the CPS \"bear a great deal of responsibility for the failures around this issue\", including bringing inadequate charges and blaming victims.",
      "She added that while there was now much more awareness around the issue, \"in my foundation we still see individual cases subjected to massive failures in the systems\".",
      "We have been unable to find any direct criticism of Starmer personally in any of the reports on the scandal, nor can we identify any suggestions that he himself made any decisions not to prosecute.",
      "How has Starmer responded?",

      "Previously, victims may not have been viewed as credible if they had not complained immediately, if they had used drugs or alcohol or if they had dressed or acted in particular ways.",
      "On child sexual abuse prosecutions, we found CPS figures dating back to 2007 but the early years are now only on archived web pages - as they are no longer on the CPS website.",

      "a new deal with the independent sector so more NHS patients can be treated in private clinics, with a particular emphasis on joint operations and gynaecological procedures",
      "Sir Keir said: \"NHS backlogs have ballooned in recent years, leaving millions of patients languishing on waiting lists, often in pain or fear, lives on hold, potential unfulfilled.",
      "\"This elective reform plan will deliver on our promise to end the backlogs.",
      "On expanding use of the private sector, Sir Keir acknowledged \"some would not like this\" but added: \"I'm not interested in putting ideology before patients.\"",
      "A key Labour election pledge, now included in the government's six main priorities, is for 92% of patients to begin treatment or be given the all clear within 18 weeks, by the end of this Parliament.",
      "This has been an official NHS target for some time but has not been met since 2015.",
      "Currently, only 59% of patients meet the 18-week target, with three million people waiting longer.",
      "The new promise is to reach 65% by March 2026, which, according to the government, would reduce the backlog by more than 450,000.",

      "More surgical hubs will also be created to focus on common, less complex procedures, such as cataract surgeries and some orthopaedic work.",

      "The new plan also says abolishing automatic review appointments after treatment, offering them instead only to patients who request them, will free up a million appointments every year for patients who really need them.",
      "And officials say these extra appointments will be in addition to the two million a year - or 40,000 a week - above the normal annual total of more than 100 million, that Labour promised, before the election, to create within a year.",
      "'Boosting convenience'",

      "The overall waiting list for NHS appointments, procedures, and surgeries in England stands at just under 7.5 million.",

      "\"Doctors have been just as frustrated as their patients by the lack of facilities to deliver care and want to bring waiting lists down,\" he said.",

      "In a post on his social media site X, Musk said Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party - but did not explain his reasoning.",
      "Farage suggested this was due to a disagreement over Musk's support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.",
      "He said Musk's comment was \"a surprise\", but that he would \"never sell out my principles\".",

      "Robinson admitted in court to breaching an injunction against repeating claims about a Syrian refugee schoolboy after losing a 2021 libel case.",
      "In a social media post on Sunday in response to Musk's comment, Farage said: \"Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree\".",

      "Musk's father Errol has suggested the SpaceX and Tesla mogul might even be prepared to become a UK citizen to make a $100m (\u00a380.5 m) donation to Reform UK. Farage later said speculation about the figure was \"for the birds\".",
      "As a US citizen, Musk cannot make personal political donations in the UK - but could make one through the British branch of his company X.",

      "Musk has spent the week amplifying calls by Reform UK and the Conservative Party for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.",
      "The calls came after the government turned down a request to conduct an inquiry into historical cases of sexual abuse in Oldham, saying the council should lead it instead.",

      "\"From free entry to Wales's national museums to the decision to build Wales Millennium Centre, Jenny dedicated her life to serving the people of Cardiff and Wales.\"",
      "The former leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams told BBC Radio Wales that Baroness Randerson's influence was \"significant, but, as always with Jenny, it was done in a very quiet and understated way\".",

    "story": [
      "Wes Streeting has defended the timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028.",
      "The health and social care secretary is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", but said on Friday the process \"would take time\".",
      "The independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, will begin work in April but is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the timescale \"feels far too long\" and urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",
      "Ms Woolnough told the Today programme the government should \"get on and do a whole range of things that [it] can now\" and then accelerate the timetable for further reform.",
      "\"Measures to help the workforce, measures to improve quality and so on, you don't need a commission to enable you to do a whole load of stuff,\" she added.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",
      "When asked if proposed funding for the sector was enough, the health secretary said public services were \"on their knees\" and \"there's so much more that needs to be done\", but the process \"would take time\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Streeting told the Today programme that, for him, the service is \"about national standards - consistent access to higher quality care for older and disabled people everywhere in the country\".",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "The Conservatives welcomed the government's commission but urged ministers to reach a quicker conclusion.",
      "Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC's World At One said Streeting should \"be brave, be bold, be ambitious, speed up those discussions and try to get to a conclusion and a way forward before 2028\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was \"bewildered\" by the planned length of the commission and told broadcasters his party \"had expected that it could be done and dusted within a year\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",

      "The committee also called for the Post Office to be removed from its role in the compensation schemes, and asked for more transparency over how much it was paying for lawyers.",
      "The government said it was \"working tirelessly\" to settle claims \"at a faster rate than ever before\".",
      "Committee chairman Liam Byrne MP said: \"The fault lies with the Post Office, but ultimately government is the shareholder in the Post Office and acts on our behalf\".",
      "The government is already looking at the Post Office's role in the compensation schemes.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015 hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted and convicted based on information from a faulty accounting system, Horizon, which made it look like money was missing.",

      "The select committee's report, which comes a year after an ITV drama about the scandal catapulted the issue to the public's attention, said the redress schemes were still \"poorly designed\" and payments were still \"not fast enough\".",
      "It found the application process was akin to a second trial for the victims, adding that lawyers administering the schemes were making millions whilst the vast majority of the money set aside for redress had still to be paid out.",

      "Only around \u00a3499m of the budgeted \u00a31.8bn has been paid out so far, to more than 3,000 claimants. The committee said that meant 72% of the budget had still not paid.",
      "Many of those with the most complicated claims have still to be fully settled.",
      "\"This is quite simply, wrong, wrong, wrong\", Byrne said.",
      "\"There are still thousands of victims who have not had the redress to which they are entitled.",
      "\"This is the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history,\" he said, adding that there are \"eye-watering legal costs which are, frankly, going through the roof.\"",
      "Talking to the BBC, he said that  \"for every \u00a34 that the taxpayer is paying out in redress payments, \u00a31 is going to the lawyers\".",
      "Byrne added that hard deadlines and fines would help the government and the Post Office to \"get a grip\".",
      "A Post Office spokesperson said the firm was \"focused on paying redress as swiftly as possible\", adding that its spending on external law firms was kept \"under constant review\".",
      "\"Our chair said at the Public Inquiry in October that redress schemes administered by us should be transferred to the government, and we will support the Department for Business and Trade on any decisions they may take regarding this matter,\" the spokesperson added.",

      "The Post Office told the select committee in December that legal fees had made up \u00a3136m of the cost of administering the Post Office-led schemes since 2020, which is around 27% of the compensation paid out.",

      "Councillors in North Yorkshire have backed proposals to allow members to take part and vote in key meetings from home.",
      "North Yorkshire Council - the largest geographical council in England - said giving councillors \"flexibility\" to attend remotely was \"a very welcome option\".",
      "It comes after the government held a consultation on plans to allow remote attendance and to allow proxy voting.",
      "While councillors in North Yorkshire supported taking part in meetings from home the authority stopped short of giving their support to proxy voting.",
      "Currently, councillors must attend meetings in person to be able to vote and contribute to a quorum.",
      "However, ministers are looking to ease the rules to allow remote and hybrid meetings, with members having full voting rights even when they are not physically present in the room.",
      "According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, North Yorkshire Council suggested up to half of its members could choose to attend council meetings remotely over a year, but that it recognised it was important to hold some meetings in person",
      "It said: \"This council values physical presence for the majority of meetings but does not consider central government should mandate how physical and remote meetings should be handled.",
      "\"It was noted during lockdown that having informal remote meetings was extremely helpful and in the future, it would be beneficial if those remote meetings could make binding decisions.\"",
      "It added: \"Having the flexibility for members to attend remotely would be a very welcome option for this Council which is the geographically largest in the country.",
      "\"Allowing remote meetings in appropriate circumstances can reduce mileage, travel time, costs and reduce carbon emissions.\"",
      "However, on the issue of proxy voting, when a councillor would ask a colleague to vote on their behalf, the authority said it was not in favour.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "story": [
      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding.",
      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 19:17:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Politicians are navigating how to deal with the social media presence of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",
      "But the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.",
      "Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.",
      "Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".",
      "As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.",
      "UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".",
      "Monitoring closely",
      "So the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.",
      "In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic.",
      "There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame.",
      "Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.",
      "But for now officials are monitoring their timelines closely. US social media diplomacy is back and some of it is heading our way.",

    "summary": "The government says the rule change will raise \u00a3460m extra to spend in state schools in 2024/25.",
    "story": [
      "VAT is now being added to private school fees after new rules came into force on 1 January.",
      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Private schools say they have already seen a drop in secondary school pupil numbers because of higher fees.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "The government previously said the tax would apply to all payments made for the January term after 29 July 2024.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief from April 2025, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools.",
      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",
      "Campaigners had argued that VAT should not be added to fees for small faith schools, international schools or for families with children with special educational needs.",
      "But only those with a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names the specific school will continue to be exempt.",
      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "In October 2024, the organisation said it would press ahead with plans for a legal challenge against the policy. It argues the tax changes breach the European Convention on Human Rights on two counts: the prohibition of discrimination, and the right to education.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 03:49:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year across England, Wales and Scotland.",
    "story": [
      "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows.",
      "Wind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.",
      "Electricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.",
      "The government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.",
      "Neso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".",
      "The government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.",
      "Together, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week.",
      "Major fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.",
      "Neso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.",
      "The figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network. For these sources, Neso does not include smaller-scale operators that feed in electricity at a local level, although typically these contribute a relatively small fraction of fossil fuel power.",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "UK to finish with coal power after 142 years",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "As a result, government figures for 2024 due in March, which will take into account all power sources, may differ slightly from Neso's data. But the direction of travel is clear.",
      "Back in 2014, wind and solar accounted for around 10% of Great Britain's electricity. That has now risen to about a third, according to Neso's figures.",
      "Over the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.",
      "That is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.",
      "This has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.",
      "In 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.",
      "But gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.",
      "Britain's wind turbines can generate huge amounts of electricity when weather conditions are right, as shown by the darkest blue in the chart below.",
      "On around 10 days in December alone, more than 50% of Great Britain's electricity generation came from wind.",
      "However, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times.",
      "There could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices.",
      "But for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped.",
      "In its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.",
      "Last month Claire Coutinho, Conservative shadow secretary of state for energy security, said Labour's \"rush\" to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030 would push up electricity prices and cause more hardship for people across Britain.",
      "\"We need cheap, reliable energy - not even higher bills,\" she said."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:28:52 GMT",
    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 01:01:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Territory is home to over 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, but not everyone wants them there.",
    "story": [
      "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.",
      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",
      "There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.",
      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",
      "Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.",
      "'Hero' father killed in crocodile attack",
      "Body found in search for child missing in croc attack",
      "This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues.",
      "Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.",
      "His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.",
      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",
      "Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" -  which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.",
      "\"I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,\" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat.",
      "\"The bit I don't have to tell you\u2026 [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here.\"",
      "For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them.",
      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",
      "\"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.",
      "\"The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,\" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs.",
      "He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.",
      "\"We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator\u2026and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them.",
      "\"You try and get people in Sydney or London or New York to put up with a serious predator - they aren't going to do it.\"",

    "summary": "About 200 footprints made by dinosaurs 166 million years ago have been unearthed in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
    "story": [
      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",
      "The excavation is featured on Digging for Britain  on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January. The full series will be available on BBC iPlayer on 7 January."

    "summary": "Researchers say new DNA research could shed new light on what history books say about ancient Britain.",
    "story": [
      "From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions - a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.",
      "Scientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.",
      "Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.",
      "They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.",
      "Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".",
      "While the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.",
      "What happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative.",
      "\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.",
      "\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"",
      "Humans may not have survived without Neanderthals",
      "They are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.",
      "Much of what they gleaned from the DNA about the spread of the Vikings into Scandinavia tallied with historical records.",
      "This result, published in the journal Nature, confirmed the method worked while showing how powerful it could be at shedding new light on accepted facts when findings didn't match what was written in the history books.",
      "\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"",
      "The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.",
      "Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
      "The researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations.",
      "They combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.",
      "This created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.",
      "Each of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.",
      "\"We want to understand many different epochs in European and British history, from the Roman period, when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, through the Viking period and see how this shapes the ancestry and diversity of this part of the World,\" he said.",
      "As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.",
      "The technique can potentially be applied to any part of the world for which there are a large collection of well preserved human remains.",
      "Prof Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.",
      "\"Historical sources show what was the case before and what was the case after, but there is nothing about what happened in between,\" he said.",

      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",

The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",

The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",

    "summary": "LA is trying to expand its cycling network ahead of the 2028 Olympics, but some are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "From busy freeways to classic-car street racing, Los Angeles has long been considered the capital of American car culture. Can it change in time for the Olympics?",
      "With nearly year-round sunny skies, some say LA is the ideal place for cycling.",
      "\"It is the perfect community for runners and cycling and outdoors, yet as a generality we are hooked on our vehicles, we are hooked on the need to have speed,\" said Damian Kevitt, the executive director of Streets Are For Everyone (Safe).",
      "But until recently, it was cars - and not pedestrians or cyclists - that ruled the roads.",
      "Spreading over 460 square miles (1,200 sq km), Los Angeles is known for its never-ending sprawl, and its traffic jams.",
      "While cities like New York and Boston have embraced mass transit, in LA it never quite caught on - only about 7% of Angelenos take transit to work, according to Neighborhood Data for Social Change.",
      "And while LA weather would be the envy of any Amsterdam cyclist, only about 1% bikes to work.",
      "But with hundreds of thousands of spectators expected to attend the city for the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games, something has to be done to make getting around the city easier.",
      "Los Angeles adopted the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" transport plan in 2017 to expand mass transit options before the summer Olympics. Since then, miles and miles of new bike lanes have been popping up.",
      "\"This is long overdue,\" Mr Kevitt said.",
      "A cyclist who lost his leg in 2013 after a car hit him as he rode his bike in Griffith Park, Kevitt thinks more people will commute using their own bikes or rentable Metro city bikes once the streets are safer and bike lanes are more connected to each other.",
      "LA voters in 2024 overwhelmingly supported a ballot measure to require the city to build more bike lanes and more walkable, livable spaces in Los Angeles.",
      "But will car-loving Angelenos embrace bike culture? Some are actively fighting the changes, grumbling that bike lanes only worsen traffic for cars in the city of stars.",
      "\"What do you mean we voted for it? Not here! Not me!\" said Darin Drabing, the president and CEO of Forest Lawn Cemetery, who is fighting against bike lanes near the cemetery because he thinks it will increase traffic during his commute and funerals.",
      "\"Everywhere I've seen [it] implemented, they failed,\" he said. \"All it does is increase congestion and frustration for people.\"",
      "Some do fail.",
      "While protected bike lanes have transformed Olympic host cities like Paris and London, politicians are currently trying to rip out bike lanes in Toronto that have been a part of the city's streets for almost a decade (they are being sued by cyclists to stop that plan).",
      "In Los Angeles County, the city of Glendale recently voted to remove some bike lanes after complaints about increased traffic.",
      "And new protected bike lanes are creating frustration along Hollywood Boulevard, where automobile traffic is now limited to one lane in each direction for several miles. But it's also causing others to commute by bike occasionally instead of driving.",
      "Cyclist Mimi Holt used to ride her bike in Seattle then quit riding for nearly 20 years out of fear of speeding drivers on LA's busy streets.",
      "\"In LA people drive so fast, it's so utterly terrifying,\" she said.",
      "When her doctor told her she was pre-diabetic, she decided to risk the roads to get more exercise, and said since getting back on two wheels, she feels much younger.",
      "She said she can't wait for the city's \"islands of bike lanes\" to be connected to one another.",
      "\"If only there was a connecting path, I would be on them all the time,\" Ms Holt said, adding that she would get rid of her car if cycling safely everywhere were an option in Los Angeles.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the city and the LA 2028 Olympic committee were making great progress towards a \"transit first\" Olympics, as she calls it, after she initially sparked controversy by championing a \"car-free\" Games.",
      "But with over 100 miles (160km) of bike lanes planned, advocates worry the process is taking too long.",
      "So far, just five of the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" projects have been completed and 23 are in progress - and not all of them are expected to be completed in time for the Games.",
      "Los Angeles has already secured $900m (\u00a3717m) from the Biden administration to help mostly with rail projects. But it will take more to make the city's transit dreams come true by 2028.",
      "Mayor Bass and other city leaders have written a letter to the Trump transition team requesting $3.2bn in federal funding for \"the largest and most spectacular sporting event held in American history\".",
      "President Trump was supportive of LA's Olympic bid during his first presidency, telling officials not to forget to invite him.",
      "Mayor Bass said they haven't had a response yet to the letter, but she said she's hopeful President-elect Trump will be supportive despite his frequent tensions with other California political leaders, such as Governor Gavin Newsom and congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.",
      "Some people, like Ms Holt, love the idea of ditching their cars, for a variety of reasons.",
      "\"I can barely afford my car. Insurance is really expensive, gas is really expensive and it's not good for the environment,\" Ms Holt said at a meeting to view proposed bike paths all over Los Angeles.",
      "But while many Angelenos rely on mass transit to get to work and school, many others who live here have never taken a bus or ventured underground to the subway, which is often portrayed as crime-infested and dystopian in the media.",
      "And many locals think the idea of a car-free Games is absurd.",
      "\"That's a wonderful dream,\" said Shivon Ozinga, a Burbank resident opposed to additional bike lanes near her neighborhood. She said the city is too vast, sprawling and reliant on cars to change.",
      "\"I can't imagine it happening in that short amount of time given our car culture here.\"",
      "But Mayor Bass can imagine a transportation revolution and said she believes the transit changes in Los Angeles will be lasting long beyond the Olympic Games and the 2026 World Cup.",
      "\"As a bike rider, I certainly hope so,\" she said."

      "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023.",
      "This comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "China's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024.",
      "The Shenzhen-based firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million.",
      "The surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars.",
      "BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota.",
      "It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options.",
      "Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.",
      "Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.",
      "Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.",
      "At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy.",
      "Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial.",
      "Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record.",
      "But the firm's share price, which surged more than 60% last year, fell 5% in morning trade, as the figure came in below the roughly 500,000 forecast by analysts.",

    "story": [
      "A US court has rejected the Biden administration's bid to restore \"net neutrality\" rules, finding that the federal government does not have the authority to regulate internet providers like utilities.",
      "It marks a major defeat for so-called open internet advocates, who have long fought for protections that would require internet providers such as AT&T to treat all legal content equally.",
      "Such rules were first introduced by the Federal Communications Commission under former Democratic president Barack Obama but later repealed during Republican Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The decision, just as Trump is poised to enter the White House for a second term, likely puts an end to the long-running legal battle over the issue.",
      "In their decision, the judges noted that different administrations have gone back and forth on the issue.",
      "But they said the court no longer had to give \"deference\" to the FCC's reading of the law, pointing to a recent Supreme Court decision that limits the authority of federal agencies to interpret laws, a decision that critics expect will be used to weaken regulation in the years ahead.",
      "\"Applying Loper Bright, means we can end the FCC's vacillations,\" the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said.",
      "Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the FCC who Trump has tapped to lead the agency, said he was pleased the court had invalidated the Biden administration's \"Internet power grab\".",

    "summary": "From space junk gel to hologram surgery, the team had lots of intriguing predictions. Which, if any, came true?",
    "story": [
      "In 1995, the BBC's Tomorrow's World programme decided to predict what the world would look like 30 years later, in 2025.",
      "The show, which is no longer broadcast, featured one of the most famous scientists of the age, Prof Stephen Hawking, who predicted: \"By 2025 we can expect big changes.\"",
      "The programme team agreed, suggesting a raft of world-shaking innovations from hologram surgery to space junk gel.",
      "So, with the help of some experts - and the benefit of three decades of hindsight - let's take a look at how much of today's world that Tomorrow's World successfully anticipated.",
      "The 'Cyberspace Riots' of 2005",
      "In 1995, the world wide web was really taking off - a development Tomorrow's World thought would bring future trouble.",
      "They predicted \"business barons\" and banks would take control of the internet by 2000, establishing a \"supernet\" which they restricted access to.",
      "That, in turn, would prompt hacks, viruses and even riots.",
      "Verdict - The internet has remained - mostly - open, and there have been no riots but there is little doubt the actions of hackers have caused misery for many people.",
      "One thing the programme didn't predict was the role of the nation state hackers like North Korea, expertly told in the BBC's Lazarus Heist podcast.",
      "Cybersecurity is hugely important for governments and companies, and people who are suspicious of banks have championed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Asteroid mining and space junk gel",
      "The programme speculated space mining would become a lucrative industry, with companies excavating asteroids near Earth for precious metals.",
      "The show also suggested space junk would become such a problem it would not be safe for astronauts. The answer - a gigantic foam gel to slow down debris.",
      "Verdict - Well, there is no super foam gel and the problem of space junk is an acute one. There is also no space mining industry - but that could change.",
      "Futurist Tom Cheesewright is an optimist about mining beyond our planet.",
      "\"The potential riches are unfathomable and the technology is entirely within our grasp,\" he said.",
      "The super surgeons and their robots",
      "Tomorrow's World predicted by 2004, a law would be passed for all UK hospitals to publish a league table of surgeon success rates. The top surgeons would become so popular, and so well paid, it would make no sense for them to travel to patients.",
      "Instead, patient holograms would be sent to them and the surgeon would operate using \"spacial gloves\". At the patient's end, a robot would perfectly mimic the movements of the surgeon.",
      "Verdict - They didn't get it exactly right but robots are helping with surgeries.",
      "A smart speaker with a floating head",
      "The programme featured a man of the future (wearing a fetching VR headset), his wife and a young girl in what appears to be modern-day London.",
      "In one section, the floating head of a woman comes out of a \"smart speaker\" to tell the man it has been a year since his holiday to \"Indo Disney.\" She encourages him to take another holiday via a \"shuttle to Bangalore\" - which would only take 40 minutes.",
      "Verdict - Ultra-fast travel feels as far away as ever, but holograms, smart speakers and VR headsets are becoming ever more prevalent.",
      "Banking using a microchip in your arm",
      "Elsewhere in the programme, we were given a vision of the future of banking.",
      "It featured a woman going to a bank, complaining there were no humans, and then withdrawing 100 \"Euro marks.\" The bank gives her the money after scanning a chip in her arm.",
      "Verdict - Banking has indeed become more and more automated. And though paying via microchips inside the human body is a reality, other technologies - mainly fingerprint and face scanning - are much more widely used.",
      "Memories from the presenters",
      "Gardeners' World star Monty Don was one of the presenters on that Tomorrow's World programme 30 years ago. His segment predicted a huge restoration of British woodlands thanks to genetic engineering and multi-storey agri facilities, leading to the return of animals including the brown bear.",
      "Reflecting on it now, he told BBC News that his part of the programme was \"utopian\" and \"naive\".",
      "Looking towards the next 30 years, he is pleased the current generation of young people are \"much more sensitive to climate change\" and thinks people will be growing more of their own food by 2055.",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "He added: \"Tomorrow's World was by definition geared towards the way that mankind could change and improve the world, whereas what we have really learnt since then is that mankind has a habit of making things worse, particularly environmentally, and we have to work with nature rather than try modify and control it.\"",
      "Vivienne Parry was another presenter on the prediction show, and fronted a section about medicine.",
      "She fondly remembers filming it - and the rather limited visual effects of the day. \"I had to stay absolutely still. I had a set of glasses on with a little camera attached. They were stuck on my face via a big blob of black sticky stuff.",
      "\"It was this fantastically hot day, and this black stuff started to leak down my face and I couldn't move. Someone from make-up came along with a long cane with cotton wool on the end to get it off.\"",
      "Vivienne has been involved with Genomics England since 2013, and highlights that some of the predictions from the 1995 Tomorrow's World about genomic sequencing have come true, as she works on a research study to help diagnose and treat genetic conditions.",
      "So what could the world look like in 2055?",
      "Futurist Tracey Follows thought the 1995 programme got a lot of big ideas right, but missed two of the biggest themes of the last 30 years - the spread of big tech and social media.",
      "By 2055, she thinks many people will be \"cognitively connected\" - a hive mind of humans and technology via servers, which will help in the sharing of ideas.",
      "\"Brainstorming will literally be brainstorming, where you can share ideas by thinking them.\"",
      "Tom Cheesewright thinks two of the most exciting prospects for the next 30 years will be materials science and bioengineering.",
      "In materials, the creation of devices that are even stronger, lighter and thinner could change the world, while bioengineering - married with tight regulation - has the power to transform medicine and tackle \"some of the biggest challenges humanity faces - decarbonisation, clean water, food\".",
      "So what do you think the world will look like in 30 years?",
      "Whatever your answers, it would be wise to listen to what Prof Hawking said to Tomorrow's World three decades ago.",
      "\"Some of these changes are very exciting, and some are alarming. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will be very different, and probably not what we expect.\"",

      "None of the men captured after the 9/11 terror attacks had been charged with any crimes in their more than two decades in detention.",
      "The transfer, which reportedly happened in the early hours on Monday, comes days before the accused mastermind of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is scheduled to plead guilty, following a deal with federal officials to avoid the death penalty.",

      "Those transferred from Guantanamo include Moath al-Alwi, who was cleared for release in 2022 and had become known for building model boats with objects found at the prison, and Shaqawi al Hajj, who went on repeated hunger strikes to protest  his detention.",
      "The men were cleared for transfer by federal national security review panels, which determined that doing so was \"consistent with the national security interests of the United States\", the Defense Department said.",
      "The transfer came less than a week after Ridah Bin Saleh al-Yazidi, one of the prison's original detainees in January 2002, was repatriated to Tunisia.",

      "After more than three years of economic misery, Ghanaians want a quick fix.",
      "Mahama swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "He defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "Mahama's party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), also managed to land an overwhelming majority in parliament, securing 183 seats out of 276.",
      "They are one seat short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass laws and approve budgets and contracts without the vote of MPs from the other side of the political divide.",
      "The result of one parliamentary seat is yet to be declared because of discrepancies. Four other seats are being challenged in court by the NDC.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bawumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "However, during his state of the nation address on Friday, outgoing President Nana Akufo Addo said he was leaving behind a recovered economy.",
      "\"We are handing over the country with gross international reserves of almost $8bn (\u00a36.4bn). This is more than the $6.2bn my administration inherited in 2017,\" he said.",
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has disbursed about $1.9bn to support the country's economic recovery since Ghana signed onto the programme in 2022.",
      "However, opposition MPs disagree with Akufo Addo's assessment.",
      "\"The people of Ghana have already given their verdict on the true state of the nation and that verdict was very clear. Economic hardship, huge debt overhang, high youth unemployment, hopelessness and more,\" said minority MP Emmanuel Armah Kofi Boah.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the IMF - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "Prof Bokin believes that complete economic recovery and growth will take a long time.",
      "He said: ''If you're talking about economic transformation and inclusive productivity growth, you're looking at probably 15 years and beyond of doing the right things conistently.",
      "\"In Ghana we are unable to do the right thing consistently for long. We do the right things in between elections and then we mess up.''",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mahama has already set up what he calls Operation Recover All Loot (Oral), aimed at investigating state funds and assets allegedly stolen by outgoing government officials.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",
      "The analyst added that Mahama, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday when President Akufo-Addo steps down after his two terms in office, had no choice but to meet the expectations of Ghanaians - or else they would \"punish his government the way they have punished the NPP\".",
      "Mahama succinctly acknowledged this in his victory speech, saying: \"Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them.",

      "The Harvard graduate has never held public office but has a strong economic background, serving at the top of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England.",
      "He also brings with him expertise on environmental matters through his role as the United Nations special envoy on climate action, recently calling the goal of net zero \"the greatest commercial opportunity of our time\".",
      "Carney is a champion of some Liberal policies that have been unpopular within the country's conservative circles like the federal carbon tax policy, the party's signature climate policy that critics argue is a financial burden for Canadians.",

      "An Oxford-educated academic, she has a background in financial market regulation and corporate governance.",
      "She was immediately awarded the ministerial brief of public services and procurement, putting her at the helm of a mission to secure vaccines and personal protective equipment during the Covid pandemic.",
      "Anand was then appointed minister of defence in 2021, leading Canada's efforts to provide aid for Ukraine in its war against Russia and overseeing a personnel crisis at the Canadian Armed Forces mired by sexual misconduct scandals.",
      "When Anand was shuffled out of that department to oversee the Treasury Board, many saw it as a demotion and critics of Trudeau went as far as to speculate that it was punishment for her ambitions to one day lead the party.",
      "In December, she was moved again during a cabinet shuffle, into the role of transport minister and minister of internal trade.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, minister of innovation, science and industry",
      "The former businessman and international trade specialist is another Liberal minister said to be eyeing the party's top job.",

      "Champagne, 54, entered the Commons in 2015 but since then has gone through international trade, foreign affairs and most recently the department of innovation, science and industry.",
      "But there are several things that work in his favour. Champagne is from Quebec, a province whose voice has often been consequential in federal Canadian elections.",
      "He has also been dubbed \"Canada's Energizer Bunny\" by some pundits, who have watched his enthusiasm as he travelled around the world under his innovation portfolio with a mission to sell all that is Canada-made.",
      "And because of his business acumen, political watchers see him as a viable option for luring centrist Liberals back into the fold.",
      "M\u00e9lanie Joly, minister of foreign affairs",
      "Like Trudeau, Joly represents a Montreal-area riding.",
      "To foreign leaders, the 45-year-old is a familiar face, having represented Canada on the world stage since 2021.",
      "As the current foreign minister, she has taken several trips to Ukraine in a show of Canada's support. She travelled to Jordan to aid in the evacuation of Canadian citizens in the region when the Israel-Hamas war erupted.",
      "Joly has also been at the heart of some of the government's greatest foreign policy challenges, including the diplomatic crisis sparked by the alleged assassination of a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil by Indian agents.",
      "The Oxford-educated lawyer is a well-connected francophone politician who previously ran for mayor of Montreal.",
      "She was tapped by Trudeau personally to run for a federal job in politics.",
      "\"He would periodically call me to say, 'M\u00e9lanie you need to run, we want you to run,'\" Joly has said.",
      "Senior advisers have hailed her ability to work a room of either seven or 700, and she has long held ambitions to run for Liberal party leader, close friends told Canadian magazine Macleans.",
      "Dominic LeBlanc, minister of finance and intergovernmental affairs",
      "LeBlanc, 57, is one of Trudeau's closest and most trusted allies.",
      "Their friendship runs deep, with LeBlanc even babysitting Trudeau and his siblings when they were young.",
      "He has a record of stepping into portfolios at difficult moments, including becoming finance minister within hours of Freeland's bombshell resignation.",
      "LeBlanc also took on the tricky assignment of accompanying Trudeau to Mar-a-Lago in November to meet Trump.",
      "The former lawyer has been a parliamentarian for more than two decades, having been first elected in 2000 to represent a riding in the Atlantic province of New Brunswick.",
      "Like Trudeau, LeBlanc was born into a political family. His father served as a minister in the cabinet of Trudeau's fabled father, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and later as Canada's governor-general.",
      "LeBlanc has shown previous ambitions to lead the party, running in 2008 but losing to Michael Ignatieff. He did not run again in the next leadership race, which was won by Trudeau.",
      "He is in remission after cancer treatment and is known to be an affable and a strong political communicator.",
      "Christy Clark, a former provincial premier",
      "The former premier of British Columbia has expressed an interest in throwing her hat into the Liberal leadership ring.",
      "In a statement in October, she said she was \"would want to be part of the conversation on the future direction of the Liberal Party and of the country\" if Trudeau stepped down.",
      "Clark, 59, served as the leader of Canada's western-most province from 2011 to 2017, where she built a reputation of being able to balance environmental priorities while developing BC's energy industry.",
      "She has repeatedly said in interviews in the past couple of years that Trudeau had become a drag on the federal Liberals.",
      "She has also reportedly been taking French lessons, according to broadcaster Radio-Canada. A fluency in French is considered a prerequisite for federal politicians in Canada."

    "title": "Channel migrants: The real reason so many are fleeing Vietnam for the UK",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:08:40 GMT",
    "summary": "More Vietnamese attempted small-boat crossings in early 2024 than any other nationality - what makes them risk this dangerous journey?",
    "story": [
      "More Vietnamese attempted small-boat Channel crossings in the first half of 2024 than any other nationality. Yet they are coming from one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Why, then, are so many risking their lives to reach Britain?",
      "Phuong looked at the small inflatable boat and wondered whether she should step in. There were 70 people packed in, and it was sitting low in the water. She recalls the fear, exhaustion and desperation on their faces. There weren't enough lifejackets to go around.",
      "But Phuong was desperate. She says she had been stuck in France for two months, after travelling there from Vietnam via Hungary, sleeping in tents in a scrubby forest.",
      "Already she had refused to travel on one boat because it seemed dangerously overcrowded, and previously had been turned back in the middle of the Channel three times by bad weather or engine failure.",
      "Her sister, Hien, lives in London, and recalls that Phuong used to phone her from France in tears. \"She was torn between fear and a drive to keep going.",
      "\"But she had borrowed so much - around \u00a325,000 - to fund this trip. Turning back wasn't an option.\" So, she climbed on board.",
      "Today Phuong lives in London with her sister, without any legal status. She was too nervous to speak to us directly, and Phuong is not her real name. She left it to her sister, who is now a UK citizen, to describe her experiences.",
      "In the six months to June, Vietnamese made up the largest number of recorded small boat arrivals with 2,248 landing in the UK, ahead of people from countries with well-documented human rights problems, including Afghanistan and Iran.",
      "The extraordinary efforts made by Vietnamese migrants to get to Britain is well documented, and in 2024 the BBC reported on how Vietnamese syndicates are running successful people-smuggling operations.",
      "It is not without significant risks. Some Vietnamese migrants end up being trafficked into sex work or illegal marijuana farms. They make up more than one-tenth of those in the UK filing official claims that they are victims of modern slavery.",
      "And yet Vietnam is a fast-growing economy, acclaimed as a \"mini-China\" for its manufacturing prowess. Per capita income is eight times higher than it was 20 years ago. Add to that the tropical beaches, scenery and affordability, which have made it a magnet for tourists.",
      "So what is it that makes so many people desperate to leave?",
      "A tale of two Vietnams",
      "Vietnam, a one-party Communist state, sits near the bottom of most human rights and freedom indexes. No political opposition is permitted.  The few dissidents who raise their voices are harassed and jailed.",
      "Yet most Vietnamese have learned to live with the ruling party, which leans for legitimacy on its record of delivering growth. Very few who go to Britain are fleeing repression.",
      "Nor are the migrants generally fleeing poverty. The World Bank has singled Vietnam out for its almost unrivalled record of poverty reduction among its 100 million people.",
      "Rather, they are trying to escape what some call \"relative deprivation\".",
      "Despite its impressive economic record, Vietnam started far behind most of its Asian neighbours, with growth only taking off well after the end of the Cold War in 1989. As a result, average wages, at around \u00a3230 a month, are much lower than in nearby countries like Thailand, and three-quarters of the 55-million-strong workforce are in informal jobs, with no security or social protection.",
      "\"There is a huge disparity between big cities like Hanoi and rural areas,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, a Vietnamese academic at the Institute of South East Asian Studies-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"For a majority of workers with limited skills, there is a glass ceiling. Even if you work 14 hours a day you cannot save enough to build a house or start a family.\"",
      "This was what Phuong felt, despite coming from Haiphong, Vietnam's third-largest city.",
      "Her sister Hien had made it to Britain nine years earlier, smuggled inside a shipping container. It had cost her around \u00a322,000 but she was able to pay that back in two years, working long hours in kitchens and nail salons. Hien married a Vietnamese man who already had British citizenship, and they had a daughter; all three are now UK citizens.",
      "In Haiphong, jobs were scarce after the pandemic and at 38 years old, Phuong wanted what her sister had in London: the ability to save money and start a family.",
      "\"She could survive in Vietnam, but she wanted a home, a better life, with more security,\" explains Hien.",
      "Lan Anh Hoang, a professor in development studies at Melbourne University, has spent years studying migration patterns. \"Twenty to thirty years ago, the urge to migrate overseas was not as strong, because everyone was poor,\" she says. \"People were happy with one buffalo, one motorbike and three meals a day.",
      "\"Suddenly a few people successfully migrated to countries like Germany or the UK, to work on cannabis farms or open nail salons. They started to send a lot of money home. Even though the economic conditions of those left behind have not changed, they feel poor relative to all these families with migrants working in Europe.\"",
      "'Catch up, get rich'",
      "This tradition of seeking better lives overseas goes back to the 1970s and 80s, when Vietnam was allied to the Soviet Union following the defeat of US forces in the south.",
      "The state-led economy had hit rock bottom. Millions were destitute; some areas suffered food shortages. Tens of thousands left to work in eastern bloc countries like Poland, East Germany and Hungary.",
      "This was also a time when 800,000 mainly ethnic Chinese boat people fled the communist party's repressive actions, making perilous sea journeys across the South China Sea, eventually resettling in the USA, Australia or Europe.",
      "The economic hardships of that time threatened the legitimacy of the communist party, and in 1986 it made an abrupt turn, abandoning the attempt to build a socialist system and throwing the doors open to global markets. The new theme of Vietnam's national story was to catch up, and get rich, any way possible. For many Vietnamese, that meant going abroad.",
      "\"Money is God in Vietnam,\" says Lan An Hoang. \"The meaning of 'the good life' is primarily anchored in your ability to accumulate wealth. There is also a strong obligation to help your family, especially in central Vietnam.",
      "\"That is why the whole extended family pools resources to finance the migration of one young person because they believe they can send back large sums of money, and facilitate the migration of other people.\"",
      "New money: spoils of migration",
      "Drive through the flat rice fields of Nghe An, one of Vietnam's poorer provinces lying south of Hanoi, and where there were once smaller concrete houses, you will now find large, new houses with gilded gates. More are under construction, thanks, in part, to money earned in the West.",
      "The new houses are prominent symbols of success for returnees who have done well overseas.",
      "Vietnam is now enjoying substantial inflows of foreign investment, as it is considered an alternative to China for companies wanting to diversify their supply chains. This investment is even beginning to reach places like Nghe An, too.",
      "Foxconn, a corporate giant that manufactures iPhones, is one of several foreign businesses building factories in Nghe An, offering thousands of new jobs.",
      "But monthly salaries for unskilled workers only reach around \u00a3300, even with overtime. That is not enough to rival the enticing stories of the money to be made in the UK, as told by the people smugglers.",
      "From travel agents to labour brokers",
      "The business of organising the travel for those wishing to leave the province is now a very profitable one. Publicly, companies present themselves as either travel agents or brokers for officially approved overseas labour contracts, but in practice many also offer to smuggle people to the UK via other European countries. They usually paint a rosy picture of life in Britain, and say little about the risks and hardships they will face.",
      "\"Brokers\" typically charge between \u00a315,000 and \u00a335,000 for the trip to the UK. Hungary is a popular route into the EU because it offers guest-worker visas to Vietnamese passport holders. The higher the price, the easier and faster the journey.",
      "The communist authorities in Vietnam have been urged by the US, the UK and UN agencies to do more to control the smuggling business.",
      "Remittances from abroad earn Vietnam around \u00a313bn a year, and the government has a policy of promoting migration for work, although only through legal channels, mostly to richer Asian countries.",
      "More than 130,000 Vietnamese workers left in 2024 under the official scheme. But the fees for these contracts can be high, and the wages are much lower than they can earn in Britain.",
      "The huge risks of the illicit routes used to reach the UK were brought home in 2019, when 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in Essex, having suffocated while being transported inside a sealed container across the Channel.",
      "Yet this has not noticeably reduced demand for the smugglers' services. The increased scrutiny of container traffic has, however, pushed them to find alternative Channel crossings, which helps explain the sharp rise in Vietnamese people using small boats.",
      "'Success stories outweigh the risks'",
      "\"The tragedy of the 39 deaths in 2019 is almost forgotten,\" says the cousin of one of the victims, Le Van Ha. He left behind a wife, two young children and a large debt from the cost of the journey. His cousin, who does not want to be named, says attitudes in their community have not changed.",
      "\"People hardly care anymore. It's a sad reality, but it is the truth.",
      "\"I see the trend of leaving continuing to grow, not diminish. For people here, the success stories still outweigh the risks.\"",
      "Three of the victims came from the agricultural province of Quang Binh. The headteacher of a secondary school in the region, who also asked not to be named, says that 80% of his students who graduate soon plan to go overseas.",
      "\"Most parents here come from low-income backgrounds,\" he explains. \"The idea of [encouraging their child to] broaden their knowledge and develop their skills is not the priority.",
      "\"For them, sending a child abroad is largely about earning money quickly, and getting it sent back home to improve the family's living standards.\"",
      "In March the UK Home Office started a social media campaign to deter Vietnamese people from illegal migration. Some efforts were also made by the Vietnamese government to alert people to the risks of using people-smugglers. But until there are more appealing economic opportunities in those provinces, it is likely the campaigns will have little impact.",
      "\"They cannot run these campaigns just once,\" argues Diep Vuong, co-founder of Pacific Links, an anti-trafficking organisation. \"It's a constant investment in education that's needed.\"",
      "She has first-hand experience, leaving Vietnam to the US in 1980 as part of the exodus of Vietnamese boat people.",
      "\"In Vietnam, people believe they have to work hard, to do everything for their families. That is like a shackle which they cannot easily escape. But with enough good information put out over the years, they might start to change this attitude.\"",
      "But the campaigns are up against a powerful narrative. Those who go overseas and fail \u2013 and many do \u2013 are often ashamed, and keep quiet about what went wrong. Those who succeed come back to places like Nghe An and flaunt their new-found wealth. As for the tragedy of the 39 people who died in a shipping container, the prevailing view in Nghe An is still that they were just unlucky.",

    "summary": "Harvard professor Arthur Brooks says making smaller New Year's resolutions can actually help them stick and lead to greater happiness.",
    "story": [
      "Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor who studies the science of happiness, told \"CBS Mornings\" that while many people make New Year's resolutions, their success rate is low.",
      "\"About 50% of Americans make a New Year's resolution. Most of them fail. Most of them fail really quickly. And the big reason is because they are too big,\" Brooks said.",
      "He advised that resolutions should be small and measurable.",
      "\"You need something small, something measurable that will reward your brain and say, 'I am making progress,'\" he said.",
      "Brooks recommended starting with simple resolutions like keeping a gratitude list.",
      "\"The brain is dedicated more to resentment than to gratitude,\" he explained, suggesting people write down five things they're grateful for every Sunday. \"It just takes a minute. You will, within 10 weeks, become 10 to 20% happier and that will become a habit.\"",
      "For those considering bigger changes, like switching careers, Brooks emphasized the need for courage.",
      "\"You have to have a sense of adventure,\" he said. \"You have to know why you are leaving the job you are currently leaving.\"",
      "For those unable to quit their jobs but still seeking happiness, Brooks offered this advice: \"Look for a way to make people happier around you.\"",
      "He gave an example: \"At 2 p.m., you're in your cubicle. The guy next door could use a fresh cup of coffee. You bring it to him, unasked. And look at the look on his face. You'll become that person who brings people things they didn't ask for, and weirdly, you're going to start liking your job more.\"",
      "Brooks also said happiness requires unhappiness.",
      "\"We're never going to avoid or eliminate negative emotions. It's important to learn how to manage them,\" he said. \"You won't know what beautiful and wonderful is, unless you've seen the opposite in your life as well.\"",

      "She has been open about her struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders and alcoholism, telling CBS \"Sunday Morning\" in a recent interview, \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",

    "summary": "An increasingly popular symphony orchestra concert is a screening of a movie such as \"Jaws\" accompanied by a live performance of the music\u2014reeling in new audiences to the concert hall.",
    "story": [
      "The worst way to watch \"Jaws\" is without music. A good way is to watch it with John Williams' famous score coming from your speakers. But the best way to watch \"Jaws\" might be with a live orchestra playing that iconic score.",
      "The New York Philharmonic plays for four movies a year at Lincoln Center. Almost every showing is sold out.",
      "\"A live orchestra absolutely reaches people in a way that no recorded sound can even approximate,\" said the Philharmonic's former acting CEO Deborah   Borda. \"It's like you're sitting in the middle of the orchestra.\"",
      "In the silent film days, live music always accompanied movies, and movies were events.",
      "\"Over the years, theaters got smaller,\" said Steve Linder. \"Then, people started watching it on their television. Then they watch it on their computer. Then they watch that on their phone.\"",
      "Linder is the cofounder of Film Concerts Live, one of several companies that rent out the sheet music and equipment that orchestras need to perform one of these movies. \"What we do is we bring moviegoing back to what it was originally intended to be, with live music, and in a communal experience.\"",
      "But for Borda, one of the best features of live movie scores is the way they attract new and younger audiences to the concert hall. \"Almost 50% of the people who come to our film series are first-time attendees of the New York Philharmonic, and the first time in the hall,\" she said.",
      "For the conductor, these shows are tricky. You have to keep one eye on the musicians, one eye on the score, and one eye on a special monitor running the film. But how does the conductor know exactly when to bring in the orchestra in sync with the action? That's the purpose of moving vertical bars called streamers. Those streamers and the bright dots are like countdowns to important musical moments.",
      "Anthony Parnther conducted the Philharmonic's screenings of \"Jaws.\" But his main gig is conducting the actual Hollywood recording sessions for films, such as \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "Asked if there is a feeling among his fellow conductors that such concerts are more crowd-pleasers than art, Parnther replied, \"All I know is that when I turn around from my score to address the audience, every seat is filled.\"",
      "So, how flexible is conducting a score live to a film? \"I have a little bit of license to phrase the orchestra around the streamers,\" Parnther said. \"There could be a little bit of variance. And I think that's what makes these particularly appealing for the musicians to perform and for conductors to conduct.\"",
      "These days, there are over a thousand live-orchestra movie screenings a year. The classic blockbusters usually work best, from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Superman\" to \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
      "\"It has to be great music that the audience wants to hear, of course,\" said Linder. \"But also it has to be great music that the orchestra is interested in playing.\"",
      "Ryan Roberts is the New York Philharmonic's English horn and oboe player. Unfortunately, during the projection concerts, he sits directly under the screen, so he never gets to see any of the movies, even when he's not playing.",
      "\"But we have a few sneaky ways of watching the movie in the woodwind section,\" Roberts said. His favorite? A rearview mirror he bought on Amazon. \"We tape it right on top of our stand lights.\"",
      "And management approves of this? \"I plead the fifth!\" Roberts laughed.",
      "With the New York Philharmonic performing four performances of four films a year, which all sell out, shouldn't they do 10 performances of each film? Borda said, \"This is a symphony orchestra. We play Mahler. We play Bach. We play Mozart. We have a responsibility to the canon of music. And no, we're not a movie house; we're a symphony orchestra.\"",
      "Well, OK. But even Borda acknowledges that live-orchestra movies have become a popular and important option for American orchestras. \"We should be places that are integrated into the fabric of the community,\" she said. \"And so, we want the New York Philharmonic to be as popular as the New York Yankees or the Mets. And movies can help get us there.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "In the sweeping new period drama, Adrien Brody stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth, a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and seeks to rebuild his career after emigrating to America.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",

    "summary": "In Pedro Almod\u00f3var's acclaimed new film, \"The Room Next Door,\" Tilda Swinton stars as a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis who seeks to die on her own terms and timeline.",
    "story": [
      "\"I've spent quite a lot of my life over the last 15 years in the really honored, privileged position of being close to people who are reaching the end of their lives,\" said actress Tilda Swinton. \"And then to make a film about it is a blessing on a blessing, really.\"",
      "Drawing on those experiences helped Swinton earn an acting nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes. In \"The Room Next Door,\" she portrays a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Her character, Martha, faces questions about how to live. \"My first 'Martha,' if you like, was Derek Jarman,\" she said. The director, artist and gay activist (who cast Swinton in her first film, \"Caravaggio\"), was diagnosed with HIV in 1986.",
      "The Oscar-winner credits Jarman with finding her a home in cinema, and showing her how collaborative filmmaking could be. They made seven feature films together before his death, in 1994.",
      "She said, \"He modeled a kind of attitude to his dismount that I drew on, like, to my core, for myself, and in fact I have reflected in the portrait of Martha.\"",
      "I asked, \"You think about specific people as you're acting?\"",
      "\"Well, an attitude, yeah, that I've seen played out, that I've witnessed \u2013 my parents, my children's beloved father, John Byrne, who died last year,\" she replied. \"It's been such a privilege to be in that hot seat beside them and seeing them face the inevitable with such dignity and humor and wit, and just power.\"",
      "\"The Room Next Door\" is the first English-language feature film by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Swinton's co-star, Julianne Moore, is another Academy Award-winner. \"He asked me who I wanted,\" said Swinton. \"It was her face that I saw at the end of the bed. It was her listening face that I felt was the right face.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Room Next Door\" click on the video player below:",
      "Swinton has made more than 80 films, winning an Oscar for the 2007 \"Michael Clayton.\" Still, she says the big studio productions are the exception. She veers toward independent films, thriving in the experimental.",
      "Asked about the expressiveness of her eyes, and of how much she can \"say\" without saying anything, Swinton said, \"I suppose I started in silent cinema with Derek Jarman. I actually prefer silent cinema.\"",
      "Why? \"I loved it first,\" she said. \"And then when I started working with Derek, I found my comfort zone in front of a silent camera. I think it's a very rare screenplay that is able to approach what I'm really interested in, which is inarticulacy. Even now, I sort of know what I want to say to you, but I can't pull the words out my ear, and they're coming out a little wrong.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you say it with your eyes?\"",
      "\"That's what I'm really interested in!\" she laughed.",
      "She's played a tortured mother in \"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\" and she's not exactly cuddly in the Almod\u00f2var film. But just before our interview, joking about some fabulous boots she was wearing, we glimpsed another side of Swinton.",
      "I asked, \"You've done a lot of films, but you can seem so serious \u2026 Like this? Not at all. There is a curiosity and a warmth, and you jump out.\"",
      "\"The jumping out, I get. The seriousness, I am a little confused by.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I am always doing comedy,\" she said. \"I feel everything I do is funny. But I think maybe because I'm a shy person and I don't tend to smile with my teeth all over the place, there's has been an assumption that there was more seriousness than nonsense, but there is a hell of a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "\"You're a shy person?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"You picked a tough career for that!\"",
      "\"I know! It's strange, isn't it? But I think what makes me most shy is being singled out.\"",
      "So, when she's alone on the red carpet, she finds that ensemble approach through fashion.\u00a0 \"It's very playful. My relationship with fashion is entirely dependent on my relationship with certain individuals who are my friends, who happen to be some of the greatest designers in the world, who give me clothes. And that makes going out into a public arena when you are someone who is not an extrovert, not only much easier, but actually possible.\"",
      "When we met in Paris. Swinton had just flown in from a trip to China for Chanel. She was wearing a military coat: \"I first fell in love with my father's uniforms. My mother was always in some nice silk dress, but I was really interested in my father's uniform.\"",
      "Swinton grew up the daughter of a military officer in an aristocratic family in Scotland. When we met, Swinton was looking forward to getting home to her remote seaside town in Scotland, where she raised twins, and has an artist-partner, Sandro Kopp, and a number of springer spaniels.",
      "I asked about descriptions of her as \"an icon of androgynous beauty,\" and naturally radiating \"a certain otherworldliness.\"",
      "\"The otherworldliness does make me laugh a bit,\" she said, \"because the truth is I look like the members of my family. I think the otherworldly might have something to do with the fact that I don't wear mascara and I'm very pale. As my grandmother would say, it would be a dull world if everybody felt the same. I don't feel otherworldly. I feel very much present.\"",
      "Swinton is very much present, whether at an interview or as an actor. And in navigating Hollywood, those roots in Scotland help her find balance.",
      "\"Maybe it's made me braver,\" she said. \"Maybe I wouldn't be able to pack that small bag and engage in worlds that are very alien to where I come from, if I didn't know I was going home to something that feels absolutely real to me.\"",

      "A man accused of long hiding a stolen pair of sequined ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \"The Wizard of Oz\" plans to plead guilty, his attorney confirmed Friday.",
      "The slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in Minneapolis in 2018.",
      "They fetched a record price for movie memorabilia when they were auctioned off for $32.5 million last month, according to Heritage Auctions, which conducted the sale. The buyer still has not been revealed.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, now 77, of Crystal, Minnesota, was charged last March with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering.",
      "He's expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned Monday before a federal magistrate judge, a formality because magistrate judges can't accept guilty pleas in felony cases in Minnesota. But the district judge overseeing the case on Friday scheduled a change of plea hearing for Jan. 10.",
      "Saliterman's attorney, John C. Brink, confirmed to The Associated Press that his client will change his plea then to guilty, but he declined to give details about any potential plea agreement. The U.S. Attorney's Office for North Dakota, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.",
      "The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, now 77, pleaded guilty in 2023 to theft of a major artwork, admitting to what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off \"one last score\" after turning from a life of crime. The 76-year-old Grand Rapids man was sentenced to time served, one year of supervised release and $23,000 in restitution to the museum.",
      "The indictment against Saliterman says that from August 2005 to July 2018, he \"received, concealed, and disposed of an object of cultural heritage.\" Saliterman, according to the indictment, knew they were stolen, and that he threatened to release a sex tape of a woman and \"take her down with him\" if she did keep her mouth shut about the slippers.",
      "Saliterman is also in poor health. He was in a wheelchair and on supplemental oxygen last March during his first court appearance.",
      "Authorities have not said how Martin and Saliterman might have been connected. Martin, who lives near Grand Rapids, said at his plea hearing in October 2023 that he hoped to sell what he thought were real rubies from the shoes. But a person who deals in stolen goods, known as a fence, informed him the rubies weren't real, he said. Martin said he then got rid of the slippers, but declined to say how he did so.",
      "Garland's character, Dorothy, wore several pairs while filming the classic 1939 musical, but only four pairs are known to remain. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Martin stole them. Shaw eventually got them back, and had them auctioned last month.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

      "How does the public domain work?",
      "Copyright protects an original work for a finite amount of time. When this protection expires, the work enters the public domain. The founding fathers wrote this concept into the U.S. Constitution under the intellectual property clause, intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"",
      "However, the laws governing the public domain can be tricky. For example: Although Mickey Mouse returned to the people in 2024, this classification only applied to his first appearance in 1928's \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was not until 1929 that Mickey began wearing white gloves, meaning any public reinterpretation showcasing this characteristic could have been liable for copyright infringement until this year.",
      "When does intellectual property enter the public domain?",
      "In the U.S., the length of copyright protection for a certain property depends on various elements. Generally, for works published or registered before 1978, the term lasts 95 years. For works created after this date, protection typically lasts for the author's life plus 70 years.",
      "\"The public domain doesn't represent the death of copyright,\" said Jenkins. \"It's just the second part of copyright's life cycle.\"",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2026?",
      "2026 will be another exciting year for the public domain with works from 1930 losing their copyright.

    "summary": "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu in the first death in the U.S. caused by the H5N1 virus.",
    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",

    "summary": "Several Western states are seeing rates worse than last year's peak of flu season.",
    "story": [
      "Emergency room visits with influenza are now \"very high\" nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, in this week's update on the winter respiratory virus season.",
      "This season's wave of flu cases is arriving later than it has in the past two years. After the COVID-19 pandemic, annual waves of influenza during the colder months increased weeks earlier than they had during many pre-pandemic seasons.",
      "This year, flu trends look to be closely in line with the 2019 to 2020 season, which also reached peak levels around the New Year.",
      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",
      "Daily tallies of flu patients now rank as among the highest in recent years at the hospital, second only to a record surge during the 2022 to 2023 season.",
      "\"In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year,\" said Hottman.",
      "A \"tripledemic\" is also unlikely to repeat again this year nationwide, experts estimate. This season's influenza wave comes as COVID-19 levels are only now beginning to accelerate in several parts of the country, weeks later than in some previous years.",
      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",
      "Levels of the virus in wastewater are worst across the Midwest, though they remain far below the peaks seen during last winter's wave.",
      "In the Midwest, Indiana ranks as the state with the largest share of emergency room visits with COVID-19, though they remain a fraction of influenza visits and below last winter's peak.",

      "Warning comes after previous raw pet food recall over bird flu",
      "The death of an Oregon house cat and a recent pet food recall had already raised questions about the ongoing outbreak of bird flu and how people can protect their pets.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company in Portland, Oregon, announced a voluntary recall Tuesday of one batch of its 2-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",

      "Oregon health officials traced the cat's illness to the frozen Northwest Naturals cat food that contained raw turkey. Virus recovered from the recalled pet food and the infected cat matched.",
      "Some pet owners feed their animals raw meat, but that can be dangerous, even fatal for the animals, said Dr. Michael Q. Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Cooking meat or pasteurizing raw milk destroys the bird flu virus and other disease-causing germs.",

These include barn and feral cats, indoor cats, and big cats in zoos and in the wild.",
      "Dogs seem to be less vulnerable than cats, but they should eat only thoroughly cooked foods, Bailey said.",
      "Cats should not drink unpasteurized dairy products or eat raw meat, Bailey said, and pet owners should keep cats away from wild birds, livestock and poultry.",

      "Airlines canceled almost 2,000 flights within, to or out of the U.S. as of 11 a.m. ET on Jan. 6, while another roughly 2,400 flights have been delayed, according to data from flight-tracker FlightAware.

That function adds stability and helps prevent falls.",
      "But when his leg needed replacing last January after about five years of everyday use, his new marketplace health plan wouldn't authorize it. The roughly $50,000 leg with the electronically controlled knee wasn't medically necessary, the insurer said, even though Colorado law leaves that determination up to the patient's doctor, and his has prescribed a version of that leg for many years, starting when he had employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "Coverage disparity among plans",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity.\u00a0In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "An estimated\u00a02.3 million\u00a0people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting company. That number is expected to as much as\u00a0double\u00a0in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "\"Insurance fairness\" laws",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about\u00a0half\u00a0of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following three years.",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric\u00a0hand\u00a0she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said."

      "President Biden on Sunday signed legislation expanding Social Security benefits for millions of retired Americans, including firefighters, police officers and teachers.",
      "\"Americans who have worked hard all their life to make an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,\" Mr. Biden told a gathering at the White House before signing the Social Security Fairness Act, which he said would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "\"That's a big deal in middle-class households like the one I grew up in and many of you did,\" the president added.",
      "Those beneficiaries will also receive a lump sum in the thousands of dollars to make up for the shortfall in benefits they should have received in 2024, the president said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act\u00a0eliminates two federal policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"Biden is the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans.\"",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "Social Security Fairness Act could restore benefits for millions, but policies still cause hardship",
      "The new law came in just under the wire, with Mr. Biden signing it only weeks before the end of his presidency and after the Senate on December 21\u00a0voted 76-20\u00a0to pass the measure in the waning hours of the 118th Congress. House lawmakers approved the bill, known as H.R. 82, in November.",
      "Long, hard road",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been decades in the making, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Specifically, the new Social Security law repeals policies known as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which together act to reduce Social Security payments to 2.5 million retirees.",
      "International Association of Fire Fighters General President Edward Kelly in a statement Sunday said Congress \"broke a promise\" when it enacted the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "\"Today, that promise has been restored, and retired fire fighters and emergency medical workers will now receive the full Social Security benefits they've earned and paid into,\" Kelly said.",
      "How much more in benefits?",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated in September that eliminating the WEP would increase monthly payments to affected Social Security recipients by an average of $360 by December 2025, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Scrapping the GPO would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, the agency found. The increase would amount to an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "\"The law that existed denied millions of Americans access to the full Social Security benefits they earned,\" Mr. Biden said after signing the bill into law.",
      "That said, the new law does not address the \"tremendous financial impact on the trust funds and the challenging [Social Security Administration] implementation procedures that will be required,\" said Martha Shedden, president of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts.",
      "In an update Monday, the Social Security Administration said it is evaluating how to implement the act. Beneficiaries don't need to take any action to receive the enhanced payments other than verifying that the agency has their current mailing address and direct deposit information. Most people can do that online with their \"my Social Security account\" without having to call or visiting SSA, according to the agency.",

      "\"No one was ready to follow Nippon Steel and Cliffs above [$50 per share] a year ago,\" BNP Paribas analysts said in a report, referring to Nippon Steel's $55 a share offer, which offered a hefty premium to U.S. Steel shareholders. \"Cliffs no longer has enough firepower while foreign interested parties are now likely to stay well put given the backlash Nippon Steel had to face.\"",
      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",
      "Challenges from both sides",
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel are expected to challenge the Biden administration's ruling, but face an uphill battle.",
      "\"The president's statement and order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,\" the companies\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement Friday. \"Following President Biden's decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "The companies added that the transaction would \"revitalize communities\" that rely on the steel industry, provide steelworkers with job security and improve the American steel supply chain.",
      "Nippon Steel has proposed investing $3 billion in U.S. Steel under the deal.",
      "\"Blocking this transaction means denying billions of committed investment to extend the life of U. S. Steel's aging facilities and putting thousands of good-paying, family-sustaining union jobs at risk,\" the companies said in their statement.",
      "By contrast. the United Steelworkers, the union representing 850,000 workers, cheered the administration's move.",
      "\"It's clear from U.S. Steel's recent financial performance that it can easily remain a strong and resilient company. We now call on U.S. Steel's board of directors to take the necessary steps to allow it to further flourish and remain profitable,\" the union said in\u00a0 a statement.",
      "In December, U.S. Steel\u00a0said\u00a0it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of roughly $150 million, undershooting Wall Street forecasts of nearly $262 million. The company reported third-quarter net earnings of $119 million, down from $299 million in the year-ago period. The company's annual revenues, which approached $24 billion in 2008, had slipped to $18 billion by 2023, highlighting its struggle to boost sales.",
      "U.S. Steel shares fell 6.5% on the day to $30.47 and are down 36% from the same period last year.",
      "Antitrust concerns",
      "Even if another domestic rival like Nucor Corporation or Cleveland-Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring some or all of U.S. Steel, antitrust concerns could quash possible transactions.",
      "\"I think they have Federal Trade Commission issues in terms of monopolistic practices when it comes to companies merging,\" said corporate adviser Jay McDonald.",
      "Jeremy Flack, CEO of Flack Global Metal Supply, a midsize metal supplier and a U.S. Steel client, echoed that concern.",
      "\"One nice thing about the Nippon deal was we had a new entrant to the market buying assets, as opposed to continued consolidation in which you eventually get an oligopoly if the steel mills here continue to buy each other up,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "If U.S. Steel can't turn around unprofitable plants, it may have no choice but to close them, Flack said, describing the company's future as uncertain.",
      "\"Blocking this deal doesn't serve anyone \u2014 customers, shareholders, workers or national security,\" he said, while adding, \"It will be challenged in court and we have a new administration coming in, so story is not written yet.\"",

    "summary": "A government panel failed to reach consensus on national security risks of a proposal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to the president.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden announced Friday that he is blocking the $15 billion proposal by Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel after a government panel recently failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal.",
      "Mr. Biden said his decision is aimed at protecting the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency. The U.S., he said, needs domestic companies that represent the majority of the nation's steelmaking capacity to \"keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests.\"",
      "Mr. Biden\u00a0long opposed the deal\u00a0and was waiting for a report on the merger to be issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, to announce his final decision. The interagency committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks, and can block sales or force changes in the terms to protect national security. CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",
      "An accompanying order prohibiting the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel signed by Mr. Biden said there is \"credible evidence\" that Nippon Steel \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"",
      "\"This action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all authorities available to me as president to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security,\" the president's statement said.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel condemned the decision and said in a joint statement they would take \"all appropriate action\" to protect their legal rights. The companies called Mr. Biden's move \"unlawful.\"",
      "\"We are dismayed by President Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U. S. Steel, which reflects a clear violation of due process and the law governing CFIUS,\" the companies said. \"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden's political agenda. The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt called Mr. Biden's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers, and our national security,\" Burritt said. \"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "But a U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Before Mr. Biden announced his decision,\u00a0U.S. Steel\u00a0had indicated it was likely to file lawsuits, including against the Biden administration, if the president blocked the acquisition, sources familiar with the process said. Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. However, the appeal of Nippon Steel's acquisition was that it has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the U.S.",
      "Trump also opposed the acquisition and vowed in a Truth Social post earlier this month to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union said it doubted Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

    "summary": "JetBlue is the first carrier to be penalized by the Department of Transportation for unrealistic scheduling practice.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Friday announced a $2 million fine against JetBlue for \"operating multiple chronically delayed flights,\" marking the first such penalty by the federal agency.",
      "Airlines are prohibited from offering unrealistic schedules that don't reflect actual flight departure and arrival times, yet an investigation by the DOT found that JetBlue operated four chronically delayed flights at least 145 times between June 2022 through November 2023, according to the DOT.",
      "Each flight was chronically delayed for five consecutive months or more. Despite DOT warning JetBlue about inaccurate flight departure and arrival times on its flight between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, the airline continued to operate three more repeatedly delayed flights between Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida and JFK; and between Fort Lauderdale and Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the agency said.",
      "There were 395 delays and cancellations across these four chronically delayed flights in total, and the DOT's investigation found\u00a0 JetBlue responsible for more than 70% of its chronically delayed flights.",
      "JetBlue said it had invested tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays over the past two years, and had seen significant improvements in 2024.",
      "\"While we've reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four flights in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation's air traffic control system,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Consumers advocates applauded the government's move to penalize JetBlue.",
      "\"Airlines often don't allow enough time between flights and they often allow for no margin for error,\" Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, said in a statement. \"They often treat travelers like seat numbers, not people who have lives and commitments and plans for everything from vacations to weddings or funerals.\"",
      "What counts as a chronic delay?",
      "The agency has ongoing investigations into other airlines for unrealistic flight schedules that do not reflect actual departure and arrival times. A flight is considered chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than 50% of the time, with cancellations included as delays, it stated.",
      "The penalty comes as the Biden administration winds down, leaving uncertain how the incoming Trump regime will tackle transportation issues. Under Biden, transportation regulators have taken a series of actions to safeguard airline passengers, including passing rules that now provide automatic refunds when flights are significantly delayed or canceled.",
      "\"Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today's action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \"The department will enforce the law against airlines with chronic delays or other unrealistic scheduling practices in order to protect healthy competition in commercial aviation and ensure passengers are treated fairly.\"",

      "JetBlue must pay half the penalty in cash to the U.S. Treasury, with the other $1 million going to compensate JetBlue passengers harmed by the delayed flights or any future disruptions caused by JetBlue within the next year. The future compensation must be a minimum of $75 for each affected passenger.",
      "JetBlue had one of the poorest on-time performances last year among the U.S. airlines, according to a ranking by Cirium.

      "The vehicles used in two separate incidents, the deadly New Orleans attack and the explosion in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, were rented via the same app, a peer-to-peer service called Turo, the company said.",
      "Authorities are looking into several parallels between the incidents, including that both involved trucks \u2014 a Ford pickup in New Orleans and Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 were rented from Turo and occurred on New Year's Day. Both also involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe, but don't appear to have any known connections.",
      "But on Thursday, an FBI official, Christopher Raia, said that at this point, there's \"no definitive link\" between the two occurrences.",
      "In an email to CBS News, a Turo spokesperson said the company is \"actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.\"",
      "Turo CEO Andre Haddad released a statement on Friday detailing the company's ongoing cooperation with authorities. \"We've spent these tense, mournful hours investigating, partnering with law enforcement, and working around the clock to figure out how our platform could be misused by the perpetrators of such atrocities,\" the CEO said.",
      "According to the 12-year-old company, out of its entire history of rentals \u2014 which includes 27 million bookings spanning 8.6 billion miles driven \u2014 less than .10% have ended in a \"serious incident, such as a vehicle theft.\"",
      "\"Despite this strong track record, and as an immediate next step while we wait for law enforcement to conclude their investigations, we're consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again,\" Haddad said.",
      "They added, \"We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Turo operates similarly to Airbnb, but with cars instead of houses or apartments. Car owners who aren't using their vehicles can rent them out to others via the app, which handles screening, billing and other services. In some cases, individuals have become \"professional hosts\" by renting out fleets of cars via Turo, according to a company filing.",
      "In a separate email to CBS MoneyWatch, a Turo spokesperson said, \"We are outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Turo.",
      "How many people use Turo?",
      "Turo, which started in 2009, had about 150,000 active hosts who rented out about 350,000 vehicles as of Sept. 30, according to the company's filing. About 3.5 million people rented those cars in the 12-month period through the end of September, it added.",
      "The car rental service operates in 16,000 cities in the U.S., Australia, France, the U.K. and Canada.",
      "How do you rent a car on Turo?",
      "Turo says that in order to use its service, individuals need an email address, Google account or Apple ID, and a valid driver's license. Renters must also provide a home address and payment card.",
      "Customers must be at least 18 years old to rent a car on Turo, or over 25 for more expensive vehicles. For instance, to rent a \"deluxe\" car \u2014 those valued between $45,000 to $85,000 \u2014 drivers must be older than 25. \"Super deluxe\" cars, or those valued over $85,000, are limited to people over 30.",
      "Does Turo screen people who rent cars?",
      "On its website, Turo says \"We may ask for additional photos and information and/or may check your personal and/or business credit report, auto insurance score, and criminal background to verify your account.\"",
      "The man who drove the Ford truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges tied to driving under the influence (DUI), according to CNN.",
      "In the state of Louisiana, a DUI offense is considered a felony on third and subsequent convictions,\u00a0according to Louisiana Court Records, although first-time DUI offenders can face felony charges in instances where a death or violation of child endangerment laws is involved.",
      "Turo also says it relies on its proprietary \"risk score\" to assess potential renters, which relies on \"more than 50 data inputs,\" such as information submitted by customers as well as parameters set by the car owner.",
      "\"Every Turo renter is screened through a proprietary multilayer, data science-based trust and safety process,\" the Turo spokesperson wrote to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"These individuals in question had valid driver's licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military,\" the spokesperson added. \"They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain. We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\"",
      "In a separate statement Thursday, Turo CEO Haddad also said the company is consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to \"learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again.\"",
      "Who are the men who rented the cars used in the attacks?",
      "The driver in the New Orleans attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas, was a U.S. Army veteran who lived in Houston. The FBI said he posted several videos before the attack proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck from Turo in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove the vehicle to New Orleans on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, he bypassed barriers put in place on Bourbon Street, which included patrol cars and law enforcement, before plowing onto the sidewalk, according to police officials. The attack killed at least 14 people and injured dozens.",
      "In the second Jan. 1 occurrence, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany but on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, rented a Tesla Cybertruck from Turo in Denver.",
      "That Cybertruck, a 2024 model, pulled up to the Trump hotel's glass entrance doors on Wednesday morning, officials said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred. Gasoline and camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building.",
      "The Cybertruck explosion, which is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, killed the driver of the car and injured seven people outside of the vehicle.",
      "The body was \"burnt beyond recognition,\" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a briefing Thursday, but the coroner's office later confirmed it was Livelsberger. Investigators said Livelsberger's military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",

      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \"Hey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",

      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",

    "summary": "The Fed has been pushing down borrowing cuts since September, yet mortgage rates remain close to 7%. Here's what to expect in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Americans started to see some financial relief in 2024 as cooling inflation led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times after jacking up borrowing costs to their highest level in 23 years in a bid to hose down red-hot prices.",
      "The Fed's policy shift raises questions about what 2025 might bring for borrowers, especially on the home-buying front, where mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high despite the rate cuts. On Jan. 2, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage inched up to 6.91%, its highest point in almost six months, Freddie Mac said\u00a0on Monday.",
      "Complicating the financial picture are President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans. Those could include\u00a0sweeping new tariffs\u00a0on foreign goods and more tax cuts, policies economists warn could reignite inflation. If that occurs, the Fed could be hard-pressed to continue its rate-cutting push.",
      "To be sure, Trump may be using the threat of aggressive new tariffs chiefly as a bargaining tactic to win better trading terms from other nations, while inflation may continue to drift lower this year, giving the Fed room to continue cutting rates. For now, however, uncertainty over Trump's policies and their potential impact on the economy, according to Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, leaves unanswered questions for investors and consumers.",
      "\"For much of the past year, investors have viewed rate cuts as a key ingredient that would take pressure off struggling portions of the economy and lead to a broadening of the market,\" he noted, in a research note last month.",
      "Read on about to see what financial experts predict for interest rates for 2025.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates again in 2025?",
      "Most economists think the Fed will continue to cut rates this year, although many have pared their forecasts for the number of cuts given stickier-than-expected inflation in the second half of 2024.",
      "At its December policy meeting, the Fed\u00a0projected that it will loosen rates less next year than it had previously expected. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September.",
      "Some economists are projecting three rate cuts this year, including Goldman Sachs, whose economists expect rates to end 2025 in the range of 3.5% to 3.75%, down from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Economists are currently split on whether the Fed will again lower its benchmark rate at its January 28-29 meeting.",
      "\"Stubborn inflation and economic growth that has surprised to the upside in 2024 will give way to stubborn inflation and slower, still solid economic growth in 2025,\" Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride predicted in an email.",
      "Will mortgage rates drop in 2025?",
      "Mortgage rates around the U.S. have remained high despite the Fed's three rate cuts, which have lowered the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "Despite that step-down, mortgage costs haven't seen a commensurate decline. The typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now about 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in January 2024, when it stood at about 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac data.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't dipped along with the Fed's cuts because they're based on several factors besides the central bank's benchmark rate. Those issues include the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, and experts now say home buyers might not see significant relief in 2025.",
      "\"Continued economic growth and worries about inflation and government debt will keep mortgage rates elevated,\" McBride wrote.",
      "Mortgage rates could end 2025 at 6.5%, he predicted.",
      "That jibes with a forecast from Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, who told CBS MoneyWatch in November that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is likely to hover around 6.5% for much of 2025, although rates might bounce around between 6% and 7% over the course of the year.",
      "Will credit card rates fall in 2025?",
      "Credit card rates will likely decline along with additional Fed cuts in 2025, but people with revolving balances are still going to be paying high fees. It could also take up to three months for rate cuts to result in lower card APRs, McBride noted.",
      "He expects the typical credit card to charge about 19.8% by the end of 2025. Currently, the average APR for new card offers is about 24.4%, according to LendingTree.",
      "How will rates on CDs and savings account change in 2025?",
      "One bright spot during the Fed's regime of interest-rate hikes was that it boosted returns for savers, who could earn healthy returns on their money held in savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts.",
      "Rates for these products will likely decrease if the Fed makes additional rate cuts in 2025, as they did after the central bank cut rates in late 2024. But shopping around could help savers find better deals, McBride said.",
      "For instance, he predicted the national average for savings accounts will be 0.35% at the end of 2025, but top-yielding offers could stand at 3.8% by year-end. Top-yielding 1-year CDs could pay about 3.7%, while five-year CDs may pay 3.95% by the end of 2025, McBride forecast.",

    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 23:36:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to remove special counsel Jack Smith from his post and either decline to release Smith's upcoming report detailing his investigations into the president-elect or hand over the matter to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released Monday.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his dual investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\" The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his upcoming administration.",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The classified documents case was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida who ruled in July 2024 that Garland unlawfully appointed Smith, a finding the Justice Department disputed and was appealing in the runup to the presidential election. The 2020 election-related charges against Trump were dismissed after Trump was re-elected. The special counsel wrote that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Federal regulations dictate that upon the completion of any special counsel probe, the investigative team is to submit a report detailing its findings to the attorney general for review. Garland has previously pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and so far kept to that promise, including after a separate special counsel, Robert Hur, submitted his findings about President Biden's handling of classified records. Mr. Biden's legal team raised objections to the attorney general over characterizations in that report, which were rebuffed by Justice Department officials when the complete findings \u2014 including characterizations of Mr. Biden's age \u2014 were publicly released.",
      "Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. Following its submission, the special counsel is expected to resign as other independent prosecutors have done, the sources said.",
      "In Monday's letter, Trump's attorneys revealed that they reviewed a draft of Smith's report over the last few days at the special counsel's office and raised objections, arguing the preparation of a report would violate federal law related to official appointments and presidential transitions.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote. They also said they would seek legal recourse should Garland deny their requests.",
      "Should Garland opt to hand over the report to Trump's incoming Justice Department for consideration, as the letter suggested, much of the decision-making could fall to the president-elect's current defense team who will hold key leadership positions within the department, and his selection for attorney general, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "The letter to the attorney general was included as an exhibit in a simultaneous effort by Trump's former codefendants in the classified documents case to ask a court to intervene and stop the release of the special counsel's report.",
      "Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira asked Judge Aileen Cannon to stop the release of the report, arguing they would \"suffer harm as civilian casualties\" to the case. The pair were charged alongside Trump as part of an alleged effort to obstruct the classified documents probe. Both men pleaded not guilty and in Monday's letter accused Smith of improper motivations.",
      "While Smith dropped his appeal of the case against Trump citing Justice Department policy, he opted to keep going with the appeal in Nauta and de Oliveira's case in an effort to reverse the legal precedent created by Cannon's ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed.",
      "On Monday, attorneys for the men turned to Cannon, urging her to step in and stop the special counsel from completing his report. They alleged such a move would be improper after the judge had previously dismissed the case. They also contended any public release could affect the ongoing appeal and infringe on the defendants' rights.",
      "\"The Final Report is meant to serve as a Government verdict against the Defendants contrary to all criminal justice norms and constitutional guideposts,\" the attorneys wrote. \"The filing of such a report, by an unauthorized person, is clearly improper in this context and will cause grave harm given the pendency of criminal proceedings, now on appeal, at counsel Smith's own insistence.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment.",
      "The news comes days after a top lieutenant to the special counsel, Jay Bratt, retired from the Justice Department. Bratt, a 34-year federal prosecutor and former head of the Justice Department's counterintelligence section, played a key role in the origins of the classified documents probe and went on to prosecute the case against Trump as part of Smith's team.",
      "While no date has been publicly announced for the release of Smith's report, the defense attorneys asked Cannon to issue a ruling by Friday.",
      "Aaron Navarro\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 When Congress convenes on Monday to count Electoral College votes from each state and finalize\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election, the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted the joint session four years ago will be looming over the proceedings.",
      "But unlike on\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, when then-Vice President Mike Pence faced pressure to unilaterally toss out electoral votes from battleground states, Monday's joint session will be governed by a revised set of procedures that clarify the vice president's role to prevent attempts to overturn the results of an election.",
      "\"The 2020 election exposed how ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act could be exploited to sow chaos and disrupt the peaceful transfer of presidential power,\" said Holly Idelson, a policy strategist at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. \"The bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 will help ensure future transitions proceed smoothly and honor the will of the voters.\"",
      "What is the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022?",
      "In December 2022, Congress approved the changes as part of a broader government spending package. The legislation updated the Electoral Count Act, an 1887 law that laid out the framework for the casting and counting of Electoral College votes after a presidential election.",
      "Called the Electoral Count Reform Act, the revised measure clarified the process that begins in the wake of Election Day and culminates with Congress confirming the winner of the presidential election during a joint session on Jan. 6. The goal of the legislation was to address ambiguities in the 1887 law that Trump's allies seized on in 2020 to challenge the results of the election.",
      "Trump faced federal charges as a result of the alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power in 2020 but they were dismissed in late November after he won a second term. Several of the president-elect's allies who allegedly helped orchestrate or participated in the plans were charged by local prosecutors in Arizona and Georgia. Some have agreed to plead guilty while others have denied wrongdoing.",
      "What's different about Jan. 6 this time?",
      "Who certifies the state's appointment of electors",
      "After states make their pick for the White House on Election Day, \"certificates of ascertainment\" are issued that name the electors selected by the winning candidate for president and vice president.",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act makes clear the certificates of ascertainment are issued by each state's executive, defined as the governor unless otherwise specified, no later than six days before the date the Electoral College meets, which was Dec. 17.",
      "It also states that those certificates issued by governors \"shall be treated as conclusive in Congress\" with respect to the electors appointed. Under the law, federal courts are also the final deciders of questions regarding the appointment of electors arising under the Constitution or federal law, and their determinations \"shall be conclusive in Congress.\"",
      "Following the 2020 election, groups of Trump's electors met in key battleground states on the same day the Electoral College convened to cast votes for president and vice president based on the election results. They signed fake certifications falsely claiming they were the legitimate electors, according to federal and congressional investigations. Some of them were mailed to the vice president and other government officials.",
      "Federal prosecutors said that under the plan developed by Trump and his allies, submitting the fraudulent slates of electors would create a fake controversy on Jan. 6 and position Pence to replace legitimate electors with those backing Trump.",
      "The legitimate electors' signed certificates, though, were added to the certificates of ascertainment from state executives before they were sent.",
      "The limited role for the vice president",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act clarifies the role of the vice president \u2014 who serves as the president of the Senate \u2014 when overseeing the counting of electoral votes. Under the law, the vice president's role is limited to \"performing solely ministerial duties.\" It explicitly denies the vice president the power to \"solely determine, accept, reject or otherwise adjudicate or resolve disputes over the proper certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors, the validity of electors, or the votes of electors.\"",
      "The provisions regarding the vice president are a direct response to the 2020 election, when Trump and his allies pressured Pence to reject the legitimate electoral votes from seven battleground states and either send them to state legislatures for review or use the fake slates of electors that supported Trump.",
      "Pence resisted the pressure, writing in a letter to lawmakers on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, that the Constitution constrained him \"from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.\" He said the vice president's role as presiding officer during the joint session is \"largely ceremonial,\" an opinion the 2022 law formally adopted.",
      "\"I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the vice president with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the joint session of Congress, and no vice president in American history has ever asserted such authority,\" Pence wrote.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated in November, will preside over the joint session Monday and reaffirm the president-elect's win.",
      "A higher threshold for objections",
      "The law also changed the procedures for objections to a state's electoral votes. Under the Electoral Count Reform Act, an objection must be made in writing and be signed by at least one-fifth of senators and one-fifth of House members. Previously, objections had to be signed by just one senator and House member.",
      "There are only two grounds for objections under the law: when a state's electors were not lawfully certified under a certificate of ascertainment, or when the vote of at least one elector has not been regularly given.",
      "If an objection is made and meets these requirements, the House and Senate separately consider them. An objection is sustained by a majority vote of each chamber.",

      "While Congress meets Monday to count the Electoral College votes and affirm President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election, the roughly 1,500 people accused of storming the Capitol four years ago will be focused on what happens next.",
      "Charged as part of the largest Justice Department's investigation in history, they have been waiting to see if Trump fulfills his promise to pardon them or commute their sentences.",
      "Prosecutors have charged more than 1,580 defendants with crimes tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, including more than 170 who are accused of using deadly or dangerous weapons like fire extinguishers and bear spray against officers. While a majority were charged with nonviolent misdemeanor crimes, some were accused of conspiring to use force to resist the peaceful transfer of power. Others admitted to fighting officers and attacking members of the media.",
      "More than 1,000 defendants have since pleaded guilty, and about 220 more were convicted at trial. Federal investigations said they are also seeking the public's assistance in locating at least five known fugitives.",
      "According to the Justice Department, 1,100 defendants have already had their cases fully adjudicated, and hundreds have already completed prison terms.",
      "The outgoing U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., has continued to bring new charges against defendants.",
      "\"The Department continues to pursue those criminally culpable, especially those who assaulted law enforcement officers and engaged in disruptive or obstructive conduct that interfered with the peaceful transfer of power,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.",
      "But with Trump's pledge to pardon at least some defendants and shut down the investigation, many of those who breached the Capitol four years ago could see their convictions erased and records wiped clean.",
      "Some Jan. 6 defendants had prior criminal convictions",
      "For some of those hoping for a pardon, their actions on Jan. 6, 2021, were not their first crimes.",
      "A CBS News investigation examined federal sentencing documents to catalog the criminal histories of the Jan. 6 defendants, including those eligible for release, should Trump decide to pardon rioters once he takes office.",
      "This analysis found that at least 159 of the Jan. 6 convicts who have been sentenced have prior criminal records. They include at least 41 people who had been convicted of at least one violent crime prior to their actions on Jan. 6, and at least 5 people with prior records involving violence or threatening behavior toward law enforcement.",
      "Additionally, the CBS News analysis found at least 10 people convicted for their roles on Jan. 6, 2021, also carry past convictions for domestic violence offenses prior to Jan. 6. At least four have faced sex crime allegations.",
      "CBS News' analysis draws on sentencing memoranda filed by Justice Department prosecutors, each of which included a section discussing the defendant's criminal history, if any.",
      "In at least 19 of these sentencing memoranda, prosecutors used a common phrase to describe a defendant's past, noting that Jan. 6 \"was not an isolated event in an otherwise law-abiding life.\"",
      "Among those with criminal histories prior to the Capitol breach is Peter Schwartz, who prosecutors said \"has a jaw-dropping criminal history of 38 prior convictions going back to 1991, several of which involved assaulting or threatening officers or other authority figures.\"",
      "\"Schwartz's conduct on January 6, 2021 was not at all out of character for him,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Instead, the violence he displayed that day was just the most recent episode in a three-decade history of assault, violence, and weapons.\"",
      "Schwartz was convicted of nine felonies and two misdemeanors for his role on Jan. 6 \u2014 including four counts of felony assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement officers using a dangerous weapon \u2014 and is currently serving a 14-year sentence.",
      "Potential pardons",
      "Trump told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in December he's \"inclined to pardon many\" of the defendants immediately upon his inauguration, although he has also said some \"got out of control\" and might not receive a pardon. He expressed sympathy for Jan. 6 defendants, who he said had \"suffered long and hard.\"",
      "The Constitution gives presidents unfettered power to pardon any federal crime. Recently, President Biden used the authority to pardon his son, Hunter, a move that was met with bipartisan criticism. In December, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people who were convicted of nonviolent crimes and \"demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation.\"",
      "Usually, presidents work with the Justice Department's pardon attorney to consider clemency requests. The Trump transition team has not disclosed how it plans to handle the gargantuan task of reviewing pardons for hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Trump transition spokeswoman Caroline Leavitt told CBS News that Trump would \"pardon Americans who were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted by the weaponized Department of Justice.\"",
      "Fallout in court",
      "Trump intends to nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be attorney general, and he plans to tap former defense official Kash Patel to be FBI director. If confirmed, Bondi and Patel \u2014 who has said he opposes the Jan. 6 prosecutions \u2014 would have the power to shut down the Capitol breach investigations altogether and weigh in on the administration's clemency strategy.",
      "Ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jan. 6 defendants have been asking judges to pause their cases or delay proceedings, citing Trump's pardon promises.",
      "A day after the election, attorneys for one defendant, Christopher Carnell, wrote that their client \u2014 who faced nonviolent disorderly conduct charges \u2014 is \"expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\" A federal judge in D.C. rejected Carnell's request to delay his case. He was later convicted on multiple counts and sentenced to six months in prison.",
      "Like Carnell, the majority of the Jan. 6 defendants were charged with nonviolent crimes, like illegal entry into the Capitol or unlawful picketing. Prosecutors say they opted not to charge individuals who merely protested outside the Capitol that day and focused instead on those who entered the building.",
      "Advocates for Jan. 6 defendants say they deserve pardons, contending that some faced charges that were too harsh, some jury pools were unfair or some received unduly harsh penalties for the crimes.",
      "A group of family members and supporters have regularly gathered outside the D.C. jail where some defendants are being held and pushed for clemency. At his campaign rallies, Trump often played a recording of the National Anthem sung by defendants in the jail. According to the U.S. attorney in Washington, about 10 defendants are currently being housed in the D.C. facility either pending trial or waiting to be moved to a federal prison.",
      "Some defendants faced more serious charges, like assault. Members of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were charged with seditious conspiracy, the most severe charge levied by prosecutors. Juries in those cases found numerous defendants, including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, guilty of using force to oppose the federal government. Tarrio received the longest of the Jan. 6 sentences \u2014 22 years in prison \u2014 while Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years.",
      "James Lee Bright, who represented Rhodes during his criminal trial but has withdrawn from the case, said, \"I absolutely think a pardon for him is warranted.\"",
      "Bright has also represented other Jan. 6 defendants, and he described a sense of \"dismay\" that courts and prosecutors haven't acknowledged the looming possibility of Trump pardons.",
      "Rhodes' current attorney did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Nayib Hassan, an attorney for Tarrio, wrote a letter to Trump on Monday formally asking for a \"full and complete Presidential Pardon.\"",
      "\"[Tarrio] is nothing more than a proud American that believes in true conservative values,\" Hassan said.",
      "Both Rhodes and Tarrio are appealing their convictions.",
      "Attorney Carmen Hernandez represented a Tarrio codefendant who was also convicted of seditious conspiracy. In an interview, she argued \"at a minimum,\" the seditious conspiracy charge for all defendants should be pardoned.",
      "\"I think the seditious conspiracy convictions of the Proud Boys should be pardoned. There is no reason for those men to have been charged and convicted for seditious conspiracy,\" Hernandez said. She said pardoning them would enable defendants who are also veterans to maintain some of their benefits.",
      "Hernandez represents at least a dozen other Jan. 6 defendants and said almost all of her clients with open felony cases hope to be pardoned when Trump takes office. But the process for requesting clemency remains uncertain, and it's not expected to begin until Trump is inaugurated. Trump told Time magazine he'd consider the Jan. 6 cases soon after he takes office.",
      "\"I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes,\" he said",
      "Alexis Loeb, a former federal prosecutor who helped lead the Capitol attack investigation until last October, said she stood by the cases and noted they were based on a uniquely large amount of evidence.",
      "While she declined to discuss any individual case or internal Justice Department deliberations, Loeb said, \"These were prosecutions that were staffed by career employees. And the cases often had a remarkable amount of evidence given all of the video that was taken that day.\"",
      "An uncertain future",
      "The federal judges overseeing the Jan. 6 cases in district court in Washington, D.C., are also grappling with the uncertainty that lies ahead. Nearly all of these judges have been involved in the roughly 1,500 cases. A CBS News review of court hearings and records over the last four years showed judges appointed by presidents from both parties, including by Trump, have condemned the Jan. 6 riot and warned of future unrest.",
      "Judge Royce Lamberth \u2014 a senior judge appointed to the bench by Ronald Reagan who has been an outspoken critic of attack \u2014 recently defended the court's handling of the cases.",
      "\"Just as the President must make decisions on matters of clemency without interference from the coordinate branches, so too must our judiciary independently administer the laws and sentence convicted offenders,\" Lamberth wrote. \"No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending, the true story of what happened on January 6, 2021 will never change.\"",
      "Should Trump decide to pardon some of the Jan. 6 defendants, the cases would be wiped from the judges' dockets and closed. Lamberth and his colleagues would no longer have jurisdiction over the defendants.",
      "Loeb, the former prosecutor, argued that any pardons would be \"a real affront to the victims\" of the riot, including police officers, members of Congress and their staff. More than 140 officers were assaulted during the attack, according to the Justice Department. Multiple people died during the breach, including Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a U.S. Capitol Police officer. At least five officers died in the aftermath, including four by suicide.",
      "Federal judges, Loeb contended, have served in a unique position during sentencing hearings, where they both note the significance of Jan. 6 and look \"at the criminal conduct, the individuals' history and characteristics and the need for deterrence among other factors.\"",
      "Pardons would risk repeat occurrences of the violence, Loeb said, and undermine any deterrent effect of the convictions.",
      "There are also questions about how pardon or clemency decisions would be communicated to the courts and the federal prison system, which has housed more than 600 individuals tied to Capitol breach over the last four years.",
      "\"I don't know what the president is planning to do,\" Hernandez said. She suggested \"an easy first step\" for Trump would be to sign a blanket order commuting the sentence of all Jan. 6 defendants. After that, Hernandez said, the cases could be evaluated at a more detailed level.",
      "As for the future of Jan. 6 investigations, Hernandez said she anticipates at a minimum the charging and plea decision-making processes within a Trump Justice Department would avoid what she characterized as the \"overcharging\" of the last four years.",
      "For Loeb, who helped lead the Justice Department's Capitol riot unit beginning in February 2021, potential pardons aren't sitting well. \"If you look at the publicly available facts presented in court, the facts fit the crimes,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt, Trump's spokeswoman, alleged the media \"still refuses to report the truth about what happened that day,\" and criticized the work of the congressional committee that investigated the attack.",
      "\"The American people did not fall for the Left's fear mongering over January 6th. They reelected President Trump by a resounding margin because they want him to unify our country through success, and that's exactly what he will do,\" Leavitt added.",

    "story": [
      "Four years later, the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol continues to be met with disapproval from a large and bipartisan majority of Americans, although Republicans' disapproval has become more tempered, a trend that first emerged in CBS News polling just months after the attack.",
      "The percentage of Republicans who strongly disapprove of the Jan. 6 attack has dropped more than 20 points since January 2021 \u2014 from 51% then to 30% now \u2014 the lowest level since the attack, recent CBS News polling shows.",
      "Along with that softening of disapproval comes majority-Republican support for Donald Trump to pardon those who forced their way into the Capitol, something most Americans overall would oppose.",
      "Overall, there is more public opposition to the actions of those who forced their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6 than there is to pardons for those actions. This is partly because most of those who somewhat disapprove of the Jan. 6 attack, rather than strongly disapprove of it, favor Trump pardons for those involved \u2014 a group that includes many Republicans and 2024 Trump voters.",
      "With Congress set to formally count the electoral votes of the 2024 presidential election, nearly all Republicans consider Donald Trump to be the legitimate winner, as does most of the country, according to a November CBS News poll. Republicans' views about 2024 are a reversal of their views of the 2020 presidential election. Just weeks after the 2020 election, most Republicans said President Biden was not the legitimate winner, a belief they have continued to hold.",

      "The request was denied late Monday by Merchan, who wrote that Trump's arguments \"are for the most part, a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past.\" Merchan added that they \"are for the most part, factually distinguishable from the actual record or legally inapplicable.\"",
      "Trump's lawyers argued their appeal means proceedings in the case must automatically be paused, and if the delay isn't automatic, Merchan should grant one anyway. On Monday, they also filed a demand that an appellate court hear their arguments Tuesday morning.",
      "Their filing indicates they also intend to file a separate lawsuit to prevent sentencing from moving forward.",
      "Trump's spokesperson Steven Cheung reiterated in a statement to CBS News Trump's claim that his prosecution was \"unlawful.\" He added that Trump's return to the White House requires \"an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and all of the remaining Witch Hunts.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court's historic decision on Immunity, the state constitution of New York, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed,\" Cheun said.",
      "A unanimous jury in May made Trump the first former president ever to be convicted of crimes. Sentencing has been delayed repeatedly in the months since. It was initially scheduled for July 11, but Trump asked for a delay while filing a motion to dismiss, based on a landmark Supreme Court ruling related to presidential immunity.",

      "That motion was later rejected by Merchan. A Sept. 18 sentencing date was pushed back after Trump asked to move it until after the election. It was then scheduled for Nov. 26, but delayed again after Trump won the presidential election. Trump's team filed another motion to dismiss after his victory, saying it was unconstitutional to hold criminal proceedings related to a president-elect. Prosecutors and Merchan disagreed.",
      "Merchan said Trump's own motion to dismiss acknowledged that a president-elect is not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, the transition period between election and the taking of the presidential oath is one filled with enormous responsibility,\" Merchan wrote on Jan. 3. \"Yet, even (the) defendant in his motion refers to presidential immunity as one relating specifically to a sitting president no fewer than 33 times.\"",

    "title": "Pentagon agrees to historic legal settlement with LGBTQ+ veterans",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 15:20:10 -0500",
    "summary": "If approved by a federal judge, the agreement means the military would help thousands of veterans seek honorable discharges.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon has reached a historic legal settlement with more than 35,000 gay and lesbian military veterans who were dismissed because of their sexual orientation, and in many cases denied an honorable discharge and the array of services they had earned, CBS News has learned.",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, veterans whose discharge papers reference their sexual orientation as a reason for their separation from the military can now avoid a cumbersome legal process and be re-issued paperwork that eliminates any reference to their sexuality. If they were denied an honorable discharge, they will also be eligible for an immediate upgrade review, the agreement says.",
      "\"When I was discharged because of my sexual orientation, I felt that my country was telling me that my service was not valuable \u2013 that I was 'less than' because of who I loved,\" said Sherrill Farrell, a U.S. Navy veteran who was a plaintiff in the case. \"Today, I am once again proud to have served my country by standing up for veterans like myself, and ensuring our honor is recognized.\"",
      "The settlement, which still must receive approval from a federal judge, would resolve the claims from a group of LGBTQ+ veterans who were kicked out of the military years ago because of their sexual orientation. The veterans filed a federal civil rights suit in August 2023 over the Defense Department's failure to grant them honorable discharges or remove biased language specifying their sexuality from their service records following the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" in 2011.",
      "The class action lawsuit, which was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims the Pentagon's failure to correct this \"ongoing discrimination\" represents a violation of constitutional rights.",
      "It's been more than a decade since the military lifted its longstanding ban on openly gay and lesbian troops. But thousands of those discharged under past discriminatory policies like \"don't ask, don't tell\" are still carrying less than honorable discharges today, depriving them of the full spectrum of benefits including VA loan programs, college tuition assistance, health care and some jobs.",
      "A CBS News investigation has documented the Pentagon's long-running failure to restore honor to the service records of thousands of veterans who were deprived of veterans benefits after their military careers were cut short. A series of reports documented the ways these veterans' often traumatic separation from the military shaped the course of their lives.",
      "The settlement would establish a streamlined process for LGBTQ+ veterans who were discharged honorably but whose dismissal was attributed to their sexual orientation \u2014 enabling them to be re-issued papers that make no reference to it. And for those who were denied an honorable discharge, the Pentagon would commit to a streamlined upgrade review process.",
      "\"This proposed settlement delivers long-overdue justice to LGBTQ+ veterans who served our country with honor but were stripped of the dignity and recognition they rightfully earned due to discriminatory discharge policies,\" said Elizabeth Kristen, a senior staff attorney with Legal Aid at Work, a group that helped file the suit. \"It marks a crucial step in addressing this deep-seated injustice and ensuring these veterans receive the acknowledgment and respect they have long been denied.\"",
      "The Pentagon has issued a series of pledges in the past year to right the wrongs inflicted on gay and lesbian service members in the past year. Both the Pentagon and the Department of Justice declined comment on the proposed settlement when reached Monday.",
      "At the time the civil rights suit was filed, a Pentagon spokesman said the military had made attempts to streamline the upgrade process to a short, two-page application. The department said legal representation was no longer required to apply for a discharge review and that the discharge review boards \"continue to strive to finalize 90% of all cases within 10 months as required by statute.\"",
      "But the lawsuit, prepared by the Impact Fund, Legal Aid at Work and the law firms King & Spalding LLP and Haynes & Boone LLP, called that a \"constitutionally inadequate\" response, saying it placed the burden on individual veterans to spend months or years obtaining old personnel records before they could file the applications. Those reviews would then take months or years to be processed, they alleged.",
      "The lawsuit did not seek monetary damages, though the settlement allows the court to approve a $350,000 payment by the Pentagon to cover the plaintiffs' legal costs.",
      "\"This case is not about damages,\" Jocelyn Larkin, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said at the time it was filed. \"This case is about simply changing that piece of paper because the effect of changing that piece of paper is so incredibly consequential for our clients.\"",
      "While the full scope of past discrimination against gay and lesbian service members remains unknown, Larkin believes the lawsuit could at least help some 35,000 veterans already identified by a Defense Department Freedom of Information Act request, first reported by CBS News in June 2023. The true figure could be significantly higher. According to the most recent data available from the Pentagon, just 1,375 veterans have been granted relief in the form of a discharge upgrade or correction to their record.",

      "A stack of employment offer letters is expected to go out Monday to political appointees in the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter, with just two weeks to go before the inauguration.",
      "The Trump transition had set a goal of bringing on as many as 2,000 political appointees on Jan. 20, Day One of the administration, but it's falling short of that target, two sources told CBS News. About 4,000 political appointees serve across the federal government currently.",
      "Around 1,200 political appointees were in place when Trump assumed the presidency in January 2017, aides estimated. President Biden's transition chair Ted Kaufman said in 2021 his administration had 1,136 political appointees on Inauguration Day.",
      "Sources told CBS News that candidates for senior management posts want to give their private sector companies two weeks' notice before they leave for government service. Some are reluctant to resign their current roles without hiring letters from the transition.",
      "Hiring and vetting staffers is a big lift for any incoming administration. Trump has warned against bringing in anyone who might subvert his agenda and was highly involved in selecting his Cabinet-designees and several top management posts. But he has left the decisions about the bulk of staffing for mid- and lower-level positions to those on his team who will lead departments and agencies.",
      "\"Let me be clear: anyone working under President Trump in the NSC will be fully aligned with his America First agenda,\" incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz posted Monday on X.",
      "A serious matter of debate in the MAGA movement in recent days has been about filling Trump jobs with establishment Republicans, conservative insiders said.",

But a significant number of as-yet-unannounced staff have long histories of being vocally 'never Trump,' and working for prominent figures who have repeatedly undermined the President,\" wrote Steinman, who was the National Security Council senior director for cyber during the first Trump administration.",
      "Another factor affecting the speed of hiring is the number of candidates being considered for the same Senate-confirmed post or other senior-level jobs. And Trump applicants have been going through a multi-step process, with an initial review of their background, followed by interviews with subject-matter experts and an interview with the person who will lead their department, sources said.",

    "story": [
      "President Biden on Sunday signed legislation expanding Social Security benefits for millions of retired Americans, including firefighters, police officers and teachers.",
      "\"Americans who have worked hard all their life to make an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,\" Mr. Biden told a gathering at the White House before signing the Social Security Fairness Act, which he said would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "\"That's a big deal in middle-class households like the one I grew up in and many of you did,\" the president added.",
      "Those beneficiaries will also receive a lump sum in the thousands of dollars to make up for the shortfall in benefits they should have received in 2024, the president said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act\u00a0eliminates two federal policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"Biden is the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans.\"",

      "The new law came in just under the wire, with Mr. Biden signing it only weeks before the end of his presidency and after the Senate on December 21\u00a0voted 76-20\u00a0to pass the measure in the waning hours of the 118th Congress. House lawmakers approved the bill, known as H.R. 82, in November.",
      "Long, hard road",

      "The Social Security Fairness Act had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Specifically, the new Social Security law repeals policies known as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which together act to reduce Social Security payments to 2.5 million retirees.",
      "International Association of Fire Fighters General President Edward Kelly in a statement Sunday said Congress \"broke a promise\" when it enacted the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "\"Today, that promise has been restored, and retired fire fighters and emergency medical workers will now receive the full Social Security benefits they've earned and paid into,\" Kelly said.",
      "How much more in benefits?",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated in September that eliminating the WEP would increase monthly payments to affected Social Security recipients by an average of $360 by December 2025, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Scrapping the GPO would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, the agency found. The increase would amount to an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "\"The law that existed denied millions of Americans access to the full Social Security benefits they earned,\" Mr. Biden said after signing the bill into law.",

      "In an update Monday, the Social Security Administration said it is evaluating how to implement the act. Beneficiaries don't need to take any action to receive the enhanced payments other than verifying that the agency has their current mailing address and direct deposit information.

    "summary": "President Biden is taking executive action to protect more than 625 million acres of the American ocean from offshore drilling, the White House announced.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden is taking executive action to protect more than 625 million acres of the American ocean from offshore drilling, the White House announced early Monday.",
      "The move to ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters includes the entire East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and additional portions of the North Bering Sea in Alaska where future oil and natural gas leasing could not take place.",
      "\"My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement.",
      "\"As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,\" he said.",
      "The move is a last-minute effort to block possible action by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling.",
      "A Trump spokesperson called the move by the Biden administration \"disgraceful.\"",
      "\"This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices,\" Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. \"Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Trump himself has a complicated history on offshore drilling. He signed a memorandum in 2020 directing the Interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina until 2032. That was after he initially moved to vastly expand offshore drilling, before retreating amid widespread opposition in Florida and other coastal states.",
      "Trump has vowed to establish what he calls American \"energy dominance\" around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from Mr. Biden's focus on climate change.",
      "Environmental advocates hailed Mr. Biden's action, saying new oil and gas drilling must be sharply curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. 2024 was the hottest in recorded history.",
      "\"This is an epic ocean victory!\" said Joseph Gordon, campaign director for the environmental group Oceana.",
      "Gordon thanked Mr. Biden \"for listening to the voices from coastal communities\" that oppose drilling and \"contributing to the bipartisan tradition of protecting our coasts.\"",
      "Mr. Biden's actions build on the legacy of Democratic\u202fand Republican\u202fpresidents to protect coastal water from offshore drilling, Gordon said, adding that U.S. coastlines are home to tens of millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a clean environment, abundant wildlife and thriving fisheries.",
      "In balancing multiple uses of America's oceans, Mr. Biden said it was clear that the areas he is withdrawing from fossil fuel use show \"relatively minimal potential\" that does not justify possible environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling.",
      "Mr. Biden has proposed up to three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, but none in Alaska, as he tries to navigate between energy companies seeking greater oil and gas production and environmental activists who want him to shut down new offshore drilling in the fight against climate change.",
      "A five-year drilling plan approved in 2023 includes proposed offshore sales in 2025, 2027 and 2029. The three lease sales are the minimum number the Democratic administration could legally offer if it wants to continue expanding offshore wind development.",
      "Under the terms of a 2022 climate law, the government must offer at least 60 million acres of offshore oil and gas leases in any one-year period before it can offer offshore wind leases.",
      "Mr. Biden, whose decision to approve the huge Willow oil project in Alaska drew strong condemnation from environmental groups, has previously limited offshore drilling in other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.",

Again, no evidence that he was. And, of course, we constantly see these lone wolf attackers who get radicalized, maybe on social media, maybe in some other location.",
      "And \u2013 and, you know, I would certainly agree with Mike's characterization of the danger out there, but just add that, as Americans think about the people who are protecting them \u2013 and I think the chairman would agree with me on this \u2013 the people and assets that we put up against this threat are the best in the world.",
      "It is also true that lone wolf attackers, that is, an individual who's not communicating with somebody abroad, who's not sending texts or sending e- mails, are extraordinarily difficult to detect. And, you know, though our people are the best in the world, that is hard to find.",
      "And, by the way, there's a role for people. You know, in New York City, if you go on the subway, it says, if you see something, say something. And so there's a role for everybody out there, you know, to help try to solve, to help try to stop these kinds of lone wolf attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as one official said to me, this isn't a problem you solve with another aircraft carrier to the Middle East. Some of these things run deeper in terms of the lone wolf element. That's the term you've used.",
      "How do you diagnose and deal with that, Chair Turner, if people are able to be radicalized online, and whether it's political violence or just another form of domestic violent extremism?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, on the issue of New Orleans, we \u2013 we don't know yet whether or not he \u2013 he will evolve as \u2013 as the actual lone wolf, where he operated completely alone.",
      "As Jim is saying, as the investigation unfolds, he himself indicated that he joined, as he claimed it, ISIS in the summer. We don't know what that involved. We don't know if it's going to turn out that he was tasked. Excuse me. He \u2013 he went to New Orleans also in October.",
      "There may have been opportunities or times at which he could have been found and could have been prevented. We'll learn what those are and ways in which he might have been \u2013 been found, and maybe we could have intervened.",
      "But those will give U.S. greater opportunities at which we'll look to how we might be able to in the future find others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, we've spoken to both of you on this program, in particular, about the heightened threat environment many times. And back in June, when there was that arrest of those eight men from Tajikistan who were ISIS-linked. We spoke in depth about that.",
      "Chair Turner, shortly after that, you said on this program: \"We have terrorists that are actively working inside the United States that are a threat to Americans.\"",
      "Do you know if there are active terror cells in the United States right now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think the \u2013 the issue of cells \u2013 and you and I were talking about that at the beginning of the show.",
      "Are there individuals that are affiliated with ISIS and terrorist groups and organizations that have crossed the border that are inside the United States? Director Wray, FBI director, has said so. We certainly have intelligence that says so. I agree with his assessment. I \u2013 Jim has also seen it.",
      "He's testified before our committee publicly of that fact. Those individuals are working in conjunction with \u2013 with ISIS, with the intention of harming Americans. The director has said it directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are known to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, is what you're\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And we are working diligently to try to take them down, to prevent them from doing so.",
      "And that's why the director is publicly saying such. And that's what the new administration is going to be handed, the fact that these individuals are here, that we need to locate them, we need to remove them, we need to bring them to justice, and prevent them from doing harm to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we have spoken about this issue in the past, you characterized particularly the arrest of the eight as a success story, because there was no plot carried out. They were disrupted.",
      "Are the individuals that are of concern, do we know where they are? In terms of those eight, they are \u2013 we know they were detained, and five of them were actually sent back to Tajikistan.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You never know what you don't know. And so none of us certainly in positions of responsibility would ever say that there's not terrorists in the United States.",
      "Now, I will say what I said before, which is that we have the very best people and the very best technology looking to root these people out and find them. But let's \u2013 if the question is, what should Americans be afraid of, what has killed Americans since 9/11? It hasn't been people sneaking across the border.",
      "And that's not to say that the border shouldn't be secure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: The border must be secure. But what has been killing Americans? Whether it was Fort Hood in 2009, I think, whether it was the New York attacks that killed eight people in 2017, what we just sad \u2013 sadly, saw in New Orleans, it's actually Americans who are in this country, actually, in a bizarre number of cases, servicepeople.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: That was the Fort Hood attacks. That was what we saw in New Orleans. That was \u2013 though I don't \u2013 it doesn't seem to be shaping up as a terrorist attack, what we saw in Las Vegas.",
      "So, again, that's hard, right? Why is that hard? Because if you're in this country, you have constitutional rights, meaning the FBI can't say, without a warrant, I want your Facebook posts, I want your e-mails. That's what makes this very hard.",
      "And, again, let's look at what has actually killed Americans in the 20 years. And, sadly, it has been radicalized other Americans. So this gets to the question of, what are the mechanisms by which they are radicalized, and how can we as a community push back on that radicalism?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which is why I asked you. That's a harder problem to solve for.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Much harder, because you have constitutional rights and because \u2013 you know, let me give you an example.",
      "If somebody is standing out on the street corner right now saying ISIS is the greatest thing in the world, and the president is a traitor, that \u2013 people would say, boy, we should interview that person. That is constitutionally protected speech.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And I wonder how some of my colleagues would respond to the idea, because this individual in New Orleans did post some Facebook posts saying, I pledge allegiance to ISIS.",
      "You know, what if we had that debate? Should \u2013 should Facebook have instantly submitted that to the FBI? And, if so, where's the line?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: If I say I'm not a big fan of the next president, and I don't believe that he was, you know, whatever, should that go to the FBI? It's a tough conversation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Margaret, there's no question that \u2013 that that is what we're seeing from New Orleans.",
      "But the answer to your question is, no, we don't know where they are. We don't know where the people are that Director Wray has indicated\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The people who have exploited vulnerabilities at the southwest border.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 that has come across the border, that are terrorists affiliated with ISIS, that intend to do American harm \u2013 Americans harm that are here in our country, we do not know where they are.",
      "And part of the work and part of the reason why he's raising the alarm is, we need to find them to protect Americans. Now, what Jim's saying is absolutely correct. And that \u2013 that obviously, is the part that also breaks our heart and makes what happened in New Orleans so hard is, is that we had an American who was killing Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, American-born Army vet.",
      "I want to ask you both about China as well. In terms of traditional adversaries, they are looming large here. We learned just in the past few days that China hacked the U.S. Treasury Department. This is on top of the major cyber espionage against nine telecom companies, against hacking of U.S. infrastructure that incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said was planting cyber time bombs in U.S. infrastructure.",
      "How much of a trump card is this? I mean, can the U.S. expel China from these systems and get control?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, so, I mean, let's start with what we know.",
      "China has been absolutely predatory in just about every dimension. They've stolen our I.P. \u2013 our I.P., our intellectual property. You know, they've manipulated the trading system to hollow out our industrial base, absolutely predatory.",
      "And, by the way, I happen to believe \u2013 and it'll be interesting the chair \u2013 if the chairman agrees with me on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: They believe they can operate inside our networks without consequence, and that needs to change immediately.",
      "They need to understand that we're as good at this stuff as they are. And if they get into our networks and start planting beacons or start planting landmines or whatever, we're going to do the same to them, so that we establish deterrence.",
      "Now, you also have to acknowledge that China does and the U.S. do about $800 billion in trade back and forth, right? And if you snap your fingers and make that go away, you think COVID inflation was bad? Wait until you see that. By the way, they own a trillion dollars of our Treasuries.",
      "So, the point I'm making here is that I think we need to be a lot tougher on them on the areas in which they are predatory against us, even as we recognize that there are areas where we need to tread very carefully, including that economic interconnection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know that we're going to have you both back to talk about exactly this problem.",
      "I'm out of time today, but thank you both.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There have to be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There \u2013 we will stay\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: What he said.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow marks four years since the attack on the U.S. Capitol, and we spoke to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just a short while ago this morning. She's recovering from a fall last month.",
      "And we began by asking her why she thinks so many Americans decided that Donald Trump's support for the rioters in 2020 should not disqualify him from a second term as president.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California): I wouldn't say that the American people disregarded this. They just had a different view as to what was in their interest, economically and the rest.",
      "So I don't \u2013 I don't call this a disregard of January 6. I just call it something that they saw in their interest economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even just last night at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump was screening a documentary about the 2020 election, claiming his win and trying to talk about the legal challenges he had. There seems to be a continued effort to claim that he won in 2020.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: It's really sad. It really is sad.",
      "And I don't know about the film that he had and the rest, but it's \u2013 it's almost sick that he would be thinking that in 2020. He's won the election now. That will be clear. That will be clear, and, tomorrow, he will be clearly \u2013 we will be accepting the results of the Electoral College.",
      "So he should be triumphant about that. But to be still trying to fight a fight that he \u2013 he knows he lost is \u2013 is really sad.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the president-elect has said that, in the first nine minutes of his new term, he will pardon many of those who participated in January 6. He said he'll look at it on a case-by-case basis.",
      "But in looking back at what happened four years ago, there are recordings, there's video evidence of what happened. This is personal for you, some of these rioters in your office, chanting your name.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of them, one of the defendants: \"We were looking for Nancy to shoot her in the frigging brain, but we didn't find her.\"",
      "For you, this is personal. So, when you hear about pardons, do you think the nonviolent attackers deserve to be pardoned?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The nonviolent \u2013 I think that's a violent attacker, with the intention\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The violence itself.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The violent language, you think\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The violent language, yes, the intention, and, of course, the intention to attack the vice president of the United States.",
      "Now, it didn't end that day. As you know, he called out to these people to continue their violence, my husband being a victim of all of that. And it still \u2013 he still has injuries from that attack. So it just goes on and on. It isn't something that happens and then it's over.",
      "No, once you are attacked, you have consequences that continue. So I don't \u2013 it's really a strange person who's going to be president of the United States who thinks that it's OK to pardon people who were engaged in an attack.",
      "But let's \u2013 you know, let's do this. Let's just say OK to the American people. This is what this is about. Do not be conned by the denial of the election of 2020. And why would he be saying that? But he \u2013 but he is, and then, on top of that, the denial of what happened on January 6.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But some of the 1,600 defendants here were really only charged with trespassing. And when you look at the profiles, University of Chicago did a study. About half of those who broke into the Capitol were white-collar workers. They were small business owners, didn't necessarily have a criminal record.",
      "When you look at that profile, you said intention. It \u2013 it was the intention itself, you think, that needs to be considered more so than the crime, you know that \u2013 that it casts the crime itself of trespassing in a different light for you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, the president said he would go on a case-by-case basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So I assume that \u2013 that some of those people may not have engaged in the violent activities that some of the others did.",
      "Look, at this beautiful Capitol, the dome built by Lincoln, under Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War, they said, don't build the dome. It takes too much steel and person power, manpower, they said, from the war effort. And he said, no, I have to show the resilience of America.",
      "And then under that dome, you saw \u2013 you saw flags, the flags that \u2013 you know, just horrible flags under the dome of Lincoln. And so it was a tragedy, and we cannot be in denial about what it was.",
      "If the president is going to go on a case-by-case basis, I hope he does, and then maybe\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trespassers, you would be comfortable with pardoning?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, just depends on how they define what that is.",
      "But the \u2013 but I know that some of that encouragement and then the follow- up that \u2013 that so many people were threatened, including me and \u2013 and to my home, looking for me, and finding my husband, and, as I say, who still suffers from head injuries from \u2013 on that day.",
      "So, these things don't just happen and go away when you have a head injury.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: But, anyway, to \u2013 to \u2013 to see the threat to so many people in elective office, now, going beyond me, but so many people in elective office, it shouldn't be a threat to your family that you have chosen to do public service.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote in your book about that 2022 attack on your husband, and you said your daughter told you, if she had known what you were signing up for, she would never have given you her blessing to run for office in the first place.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that this threat of domestic violent extremism is having a chilling effect on new talent and \u2013 and anyone running for office?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I certainly hope not.",
      "But, over the years, when I was encouraging people to run for office, especially women, they would say, we could never take the abuse that you take. And that was really just abuse. It wasn't physical, it was criticism and the rest of that, and that we don't want our children subjected to that.",
      "And, yes, I do think it will have a negative impact on people running for public office. Just \u2013 you know, in other words, if you're \u2013 if you're a mom, and they go after you as a \u2013 as a mom, and your child comes home crying from school because somebody said a negative thing because they saw it on TV, that the other side said something bad about you, you might not run for office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think it will discourage particularly women\u2026",
      "NANCY PELOSI: Particularly women.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 from running?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes, I do.",
      "I mean, I know that it has. But I hope that it will not, that we will have \u2013 shine a bright light on this and just say, this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. See, for women, they always \u2013 they always \u2013 women are known to be more, shall we say, ethical than men. And so, when they go after women candidates, they go after their ethics.",
      "And they'll say this, that and the other thing. And then the child comes home from school crying because somebody said a bad thing about mom on TV. And nobody \u2013 nobody wants that. So, hopefully, the bright light shining on that will reduce \u2013 reduce that.",
      "But I think that women have a \u2013 proven that they are \u2013 are more ethical, and that they \u2013 they are \u2013 well, maybe they're not more ethical, they're all ethical, but that they can then withstand that criticism.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE (R-SD): It's always challenging, and especially in the - in this current political environment. We don't always agree on (ph) Republicans within the family. But I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Particularly among Republicans.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: But why - but I think when it comes to the big issues, securing the border, rebuilding the military, strengthening the economy, you know, generating energy dominance for this country, those are all things on which we agree.",
      "With respect to even narrow margins, I think we're going to have a - hopefully a very unified effort when it comes to those core issues. We'll disagree on the margins, and the process and all that sort of thing. But when it comes to the things we need to get done, those are all things I think we agree on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've had disagreements with Donald Trump in the past. As part of this advise and consent role -",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The role of the Senate, will you tell him when you think he's wrong?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: I will. And I think my job is to do everything I can to help him achieve success, be a successful president, which, in my view, means it will be a successful country. We have the same set of objectives. We want to get to the same destination. But I think at times there will be differences in how we get there. And understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the president and - and help him understand, I think, what the - you know, what the contours are, what we can accomplish here in the Senate and what's realistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a 53-seat majority over here, which means you can only lose three votes. If Democrats remain unified in their opposition to some of Mr. Trump's picks for his cabinet, do you expect them all to make it through?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: What I promised is a fair process for all of them. When it comes to his picks, and I would say this of any president, they deserve a lot of latitude. His picks are going to come through a process where if they get reported out of the committee, come across the floor of the Senate, we'll make sure that they get the - the vote. And I think that - I suspect a lot of them will get through. And - and we'll see about all of them remains to be seen. But I think that's why we have the process, adhere to that process, and give all of these nominees an opportunity to make their cay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said you have to see if Democrats play ball or not. But you don't need Democrats to get these through. So, does that mean you already know some of your Republican senators won't vote to confirm Kash Patel at the FBI or Pete Hegseth at the pentagon?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: We don't have, at this point, I don't think, clarity on that. I think these are nominees who are new enough, they've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, frankly, have gone very well. But they still have to make their case in front of - of the committee.",
      "And, you know, we don't know all the information about some of these nominees. I think we know a lot about them. But they deserve a fair process.",
      "We have a three-vote margin in the Senate, as you point out, but I do think that in most cases at least, most of our Republican senators are inclined to give the president the people that he wants in these positions, given, you know, the process that they go through and whether or not they can manage the committee process and ensure that they get to the floor for a vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that include FBI background checks? I know often the ranking members get them on Armed Services, for example, but some of your colleagues, they want to see Pete Hegseth's FBI background check before they vote.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Right. And I think that's going to be determined largely by the committee chairs. I think there will be an interest, obviously -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you encourage that?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, sure. I mean I think that you want to have as much background as possible and that is available to the committees as they make their decisions. I have a high level of confidence in our chairs that they will ensure that as members of the committee and of the full Senate have an opportunity to consider these nominees, that they've got all of the information available to them that they should have.",

      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, it's one of those issues that has become incredibly divisive for the country. And there aren't very many people left in the middle. Reconciliation enables us - it doesn't come along very often where you have unified control of the government. In a lot of cases it doesn't last very long. It's a couple of years.",
      "The Democrats provided a template in the last couple of years for how to expand the scope of what's available to get done through the reconciliation process. It's the only process in the Senate that enables you to enact legislation with a 51-vote threshold as opposed to 60.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's out of the gate saying, we're not going to work with Democrats.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, I'm not saying what - they came out of the gate. They had their first reconciliation bill done in four weeks coming out - when they got the majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: $2 trillion.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, and they spent -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: With the Covid bill. And you didn't like it.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You faulted them for using reconciliation. Exactly.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: It would be ideal if we could figure out a way to do things at the 60-vote threshold. And there are a number of things we will. We think that a generational investment in the border is necessary given where we are after the last four years of a - what I think is a very failed Biden/Harris border policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 1.4 million people here with deportation orders.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Orders of removal against them. I've seen numbers that put the cost of expelling them at between $80 to $100 billion annually. Can you get that kind of money in the first hundred days?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: What we're trying to do is get an assessment from the people who are going to be in place. They're going to be implementing a lot of the president's policies when it comes to the border to determine what that - that resource allocation is going to need - need to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They don't know yet.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, I think that what we do know is we need physical barriers, we need technological barriers, we need more ICE agents, we need more Border Patrol agents and - and, yes, we're going to need ways of deporting people that are on that - on that list that you mentioned. And so, it's going to take some resources to do that, which is why I would argue that when the president takes office, and he's going to do a lot of things on the border by executive order, by executive action, that we're going to need to be able to provide the resources in order for him to do that. And that's why I've suggested that we take that border issue on right away and enable him to do the things that he needs to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it true you're going to put some defense spending in that as well?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, I think one of the things that we always argue about around here is the amount of money that we need to spend on defense. If you look at every Biden administration budget, there wasn't a single one of them when it came to military spending that came up - kept up even with inflation. So, we have a military readiness in this country. You know, we have the defense commission strategy group that comes out with a report all the time and tells us we are dramatically underfunded relative to countries like China and that we don't have the capacity -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those should be bipartisan issues, right? So -",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, and we don't have the capacity and capability to do what needs to be done to protect the country. There's a big difference in delta in the two parties and how they approach the issue of defense and, you know, and military readiness. And I think we are dramatically underfunding our military today. I think the president believes that, President Trump. And I think a lot of our Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate share that view.",
      "So, can we do this through reconciliation? We're obviously looking at our options.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to make sure I ask you about the other big promise you made in terms of delivering on tax reform and reconciliation.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The estimates are it could add $4 trillion over the next decade. Is that really something you think is going to pass on a party-line vote and without any revenue or spending cuts?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well, they're -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can't be comfortable.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: These are tax laws that will expire at the end of this year if Congress doesn't take action to extend them. And it would represent a $4 trillion tax increase on the American people if we don't extend that policy.",
      "We're going to have a very robust conversation about tax reform. There's a lot riding on it economically. I think regulatory policy, tax policy, energy policy are going to be really essential to the strength of our economy, how fast we can grow and expand and creator better paying jobs in this country.",
      "So, I'm a big believer in pro-growth tax policy. I believe you get a lot of that back through growth in additional revenue. Every 1 percent -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not tariffs, as Mr. Trump has promised?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: Well - well, that's - that's a different subject. But I would say every 1 percent increase in - in GDP, in economic growth, we're told, generates about $3 trillion in additional tax revenue. So, you're going to get some back in terms of a growth dividend. And there will be spending cuts. There's no question about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going out of the gate with two big issues on party- line votes, aren't you concerned that will blow up your chances at working with Democrats on some of those bigger immigration issues, or bigger policies?",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: We need to continue to work on those big policy issues. But I also think that we have some immediate concerns, matters that need to be addressed. One of which is national security, given the increasingly dangerous world in which we live. And, of course, I would argue, that starts with the border. So, border, national security. I think energy policy, energy dominance, is a huge objective and goal. And I would hope that a reconciliation bill could also address that issue. If we do something on taxes, that traditionally has been in the past. The Democrats did it twice while they had the majority in the last session of the Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump did that in 2017, too, with taxes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN THUNE: And that's - and both sides have done it. And that's the unique aspect of having unified control of the government. But I think those are all important and they are things that, as a country, if we don't get right, I fear what the results and the outcome will be.",
      "And, yes, it would be ideal if you could do it bipartisan. I hope that there are some Democrats who would vote for some of the tax policies that we have, but I'm not - I'm not expecting that at the moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Deportations are now at a decade high. They were at the end of 2024. Nearly 300,000 people deported by the Biden administration.",
      "The incoming administration has promised the largest deportation operation in history. What's the number? What's the measure of success?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, let's talk about this administration, what they claim is a huge deportation number this year. Actually, if you drill into the numbers, about 80 percent of those numbers are actually Border Patrol arrests that the enforcement (INAUDIBLE) operation of ICE processed and moved back across the border. They weren't (INAUDIBLE) enforcement arrest.",
      "If you look at the historic number of illegal entries the last four years, ICE, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, has the lowest number of deportations in the history of the agency. So, they're playing a numbers game, just like they played a numbers game with a number of people coming across to border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: So, even though they claim they've got the highest number of deportations, look at those deportations, who actually made those arrests, who actually removed those people, it's not ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. It's still a higher number than the Trump administration. But I want to ask you, for the income Trump administration, what's - what's the measure? It is not deportations at the border. You're saying you are going to measure success by people who are already internal in the country to deport. That's how you're going to measure it. And what's that figure?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, again, let's get the numbers straight. You say they were higher than the Trump administration. This isn't about how many got deported because Trump had illegal border crossings at a 45-year low. So, of course removal is going to be lower. The numbers, how many were released into the United States that - that are not in the country legally? Under the Biden administration we have millions of people released in the United States who have lost their hearings and we've got millions of people that are, you know, released in the United States despite a statute saying that you cannot be released in the United States without proper documentation and you shall be detained. So, you can compare the numbers of deportations under Trump versus Biden, but when you consider a 45-year low in crossings, of course the number of deportations is going to be lower because we don't have that population to process and deport.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, I'm just right to measure success going forward.",
      "For day one, can you help us understand what the plan is?",
      "You know, a number of industries in this country hire undocumented workers because they are cheap labor. On day one, are you going to re-start raids on work sites, on construction sites?",
      "TOM HOMAN: The - President Trump's been clear, as I've been clear from day one, that the president is going to concentrate on public safety threats and national security threats. And as you heard from your previous segments, we have a huge national security issue in this country. The southwest border has become the biggest national security vulnerability we've seen in this nation. FBI Director Wray agrees with me. We know there's people in this country pose a national security threat. They've arrested a record number of people on the terrorist watch list. A 3,500 percent increase in people on the terrorist watch list being arrested at the border.",
      "We've got over 2 million known got-aways. We know 2 million people crossed the border, weren't arrested, weren't vetted, weren't fingerprints.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: So, you've got to ask yourself, why did 2 million people pay more to get away. Why didn't they pay less, turn themselves into Border Patrol, get a free airline ticket to the city of their choice -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Get a free hotel room, get three meals a day, get free medical care. Why did 2 million people pay more to get away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I'm not disputing that it is a hemisphere-wide crisis. We're talking about how you're going to deal with it. That's why I'm asking you, when you say \"criminals,\" does that mean you are going to go into already-existing prisons, at local level, and deport people who are in those prisons? Are you going to go to workforces? I mean, how do you know where the criminals are I guess is the question? And if they're working at a work site, are you going to show up to surprise them?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, look, we know where a lot of the criminals are. ICE does - they're great at this work. We know where some are, but they simply haven't been able to go arrest them because of Secretary Mayorkas' priorities, it handcuffed ICE. So, we know where a lot of criminals are. They've been prevented from arresting them. We're going to arrest starting day one.",
      "As far as being in jails and prisons, we would love to work in local jails, but sanctuary cities won't allow us into those jails. It's much easier to arrest a public safety threat and the safety and security of public jail than out in the street because the officer is after that way, the alien is safer that way, the community is safer that way. But sanctuary cities who continue to release public safety threats back into the community -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: To the immigrant community, that puts that community at greater risk of crime.",
      "And here's what's going to happen. When we go to the community and find that person, find that criminal alien -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: He's probably going to be with others, others who we'll have to arrest. So, it's not safe for the community, not safe for the officers, not safe for anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TOM HOMAN: Let us arrest the bad guy in the jail cell where you chose to arrest somebody and put him in a jail cell because obviously, he's a public safety threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. When you just said in there, it sounds like you were talking about collateral arrests. So, you're going to target people you know are criminals. But if they happen to be living in a house where there are other undocumented people, you're going to sweep them up, too. That's what I think you were just saying there.",
      "I wonder how you're going to parse out some of those collateral arrests. For example, will dreamers be protected? Donald Trump has said he wants to work with Democrats to protect them and give them status. That takes a long time in Congress. What do you do in the meantime? How do you make sure they're not caught up in drag net?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Look, every person ICE arrests, they do what they call a fugitive operation spreadsheet. They know exactly who they're going to arrest, they know exactly where they're probably likely to find him, and they have a lot of information on that arrest. Other people that are there that may be illegal, they'll handle them by a case-by-case basis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: The concentration - I want to be clear on some public safety threats, if we - more agents in the jails means less agents in the neighborhood. That's why I'm pleading with sanctuary cities, let us into the jail to arrest the bad guy, that way you're not forcing into the community. So, you know, if you go to an immigrant community and ask them, would you rather have ICE operating in your local jails or would you want them in the community, what do you think they're going to say? They don't - they don't want bad - bad criminal aliens in their neighborhoods, either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "TOM HOMAN: So, let us work with the jails. Let us work with law enforcement. Sanctuary cities are not safe for the immigrant community, they're not safe for our officers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, that's like Secure Communities Act kind of - kind of action. But then where do you send people? Because some of these countries, like Venezuela, don't accept deportations right now. Mexico's president indicated her country might be willing to receive non-Mexican migrants who are deported. How does that work? Does the U.S. pay Mexico to then ship those people off somewhere else?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, first of all, we've got President Trump coming into the Oval Office and he's proven, during his first administration, his leadership on illegal immigration was a game changer because, for instance, El Salvador wouldn't take back MS-13 members when I was the ICE director. It took President Trump 48 hours to get El Salvador to take back their criminal aliens into their prisons. And Mexico didn't want to do the remain in Mexico program, but President Trump was able to get remain in Mexico established in Mexico. He was able to get Mexico to put military on their southern and northern border. President Trump's a strong president.",
      "This administration has not forced these countries to take them back. And we have what we call a third save (ph) countries. We already have countries talking about taking back people from other countries if - if, for instance, Venezuela don't want to take their people back, there's others ways we can do it. There's other countries that will be willing to accept them. We're hoping that President Trump will work with Venezuela, like he did with Mexico and El Salvador and get these countries to take them back. If they don't, they're still going to be deported, they're just going to be deported to a different country.",
      "We've not going to be held up by removing public safety threats in this country. We've got to put - we've got to put the safety of the American people first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TOM HOMAN: We've got too many young women murdered and raped and burn alive by members of Venezuelan gangs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

Actually, if you drill in- drill into the numbers, about 80% of those numbers were actually Border Patrol arrests that the Enforcement and Removal Operations of ICE processed and moved back across the border.

So you're going to target people you know are criminals, but if they happen to be living in a house where there are other undocumented people, you're going to sweep them up too. That's what I think you were just saying there. I wonder how you're going to parse out some of those collateral arrests. For example, will Dreamers be protected? Donald Trump has said he wants to work with Democrats to protect them and give them status. That takes a long time in Congress. What do you do in the meantime? How do you make sure they're not caught up in a dragnet?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Look, every- every- every person ICE arrests, they do what we call fugitive operations spreadsheet. They know exactly who they're going to arrest. They know exactly where they're probably likely to find them, and they have a lot of information on that arrest. Other people that are there that may be illegal, they'll handle by case-by-case basis. The concentration- I want to be clear on some public safety threats. If more agents in the jails means less agents in the neighborhood, that's why I'm pleading with sanctuary cities, let us in the jail to arrest the bad guy. That way you're not forcing in the community. So- you know, if you go to an immigrant community and ask them, would you rather have ICE operating in your local jails? Would you want them in the community? What do you think they're going to say? They don't- they don't want bad- bad criminal aliens in their neighborhoods either. So let us work with the jails. Let us work with law enforcement. Sanctuary cities are not safe for this- for the immigrant community, not safe for our officers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so that's like, Secure Communities act- kind of- kind of action. But then where do you send people? Because some of these countries, like Venezuela, don't accept deportations right now. Mexico's president indicated her country might be willing to receive non-Mexican migrants who are deported. How does that work? Does the U.S. pay Mexico to then ship those people off somewhere else?",
      "TOM HOMAN: Well, first of all, we got President Trump coming to the Oval Office, and he's proven during his first administration, his- his leadership on illegal immigration was a game changer, because, for instance, El Salvador wouldn't take back MS-13 members when I was the ICE Director. It took President Trump 48 hours to get El Salvador to take back their criminal aliens into their prisons. And Mexico didn't want to do the Remain in Mexico program. But President Trump was able to get Remain in Mexico- Remain in Mexico established in Mexico. He was able to get Mexico put military on the southern and northern border. President Trump's a strong president. This administration has not forced these countries to take them back, and we have what we call third safe country. We already have countries talking about taking back people from other countries if- if for instance, Venezuela don't take their people back. There's other ways we can do it. There's other countries be willing to accept them. We're hoping that President Trump will work with Venezuela and like he did with Mexico and El Salvador, and get these countries take them back. If they don't, they're still gonna be deported. They're just gonna be deported to a different country. We're not gonna be held up on removing public safety trust in this country. We gotta put- we gotta put the safety of the American people first. We've had too many young women murdered and raped and burned alive by members of Venezuelan gangs. They need to be a priority under this administration. They're gonna be a priority starting day one, and they will be deported.",

      "\"He called out to these people to continue their violence, my husband being a victim of all of that,\" Pelosi said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Pelosi, a frequent recipient of Republican ire who was among the targets of some of the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, connected the events of that day to an attack on her husband the next year, noting that her husband still suffers from a head injury after a man broke into their San Francisco home and bludgeoned him with a hammer in October 2022.",

      "Her comments come as lawmakers are gathering Monday to certify Trump's victory in the 2024 election, four years after a violent mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol to prevent Congress from affirming President Biden's 2020 win.

    "summary": "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found matching dinosaur footprints on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "Last year, engineers working to prevent flooding on a beach in the U.K. made a \"dramatic discovery\" of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "\"While Parker Solar Probe was closer to the Sun than any other human-made object in history, it operated just as it was designed to do, and made observations that no one has been able to make before,\" Parker Solar Probe Project Manager Helene Winters said in a statement. \"From the heat shield to the solar array cooling system, there was so much enabling technology required to fly this mission, and to gather data scientists have awaited for decades. Parker Solar Probe's ability to thrive in the hostile environment around the Sun is a tribute to the team that designed and built this remarkable spacecraft.\"",

      "NASA advises viewing meteor showers in areas well away from city and street lights. The Quadrantids are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere, and observers in the Northwest and Pacific region will likely have the best viewing opportunities this year.",
      "Those heading outside to catch the celestial show should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing northeast and look up. Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Viewers should also bring along a blanket or sleeping bag to help with the chilly January weather.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",

    "story": [
      "Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to remove special counsel Jack Smith from his post and either decline to release Smith's upcoming report detailing his investigations into the president-elect or hand over the matter to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released Monday.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his dual investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\" The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his upcoming administration.",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The classified documents case was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida who ruled in July 2024 that Garland unlawfully appointed Smith, a finding the Justice Department disputed and was appealing in the runup to the presidential election. The 2020 election-related charges against Trump were dismissed after Trump was re-elected. The special counsel wrote that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Federal regulations dictate that upon the completion of any special counsel probe, the investigative team is to submit a report detailing its findings to the attorney general for review. Garland has previously pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and so far kept to that promise, including after a separate special counsel, Robert Hur, submitted his findings about President Biden's handling of classified records. Mr. Biden's legal team raised objections to the attorney general over characterizations in that report, which were rebuffed by Justice Department officials when the complete findings \u2014 including characterizations of Mr. Biden's age \u2014 were publicly released.",
      "Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. Following its submission, the special counsel is expected to resign as other independent prosecutors have done, the sources said.",
      "In Monday's letter, Trump's attorneys revealed that they reviewed a draft of Smith's report over the last few days at the special counsel's office and raised objections, arguing the preparation of a report would violate federal law related to official appointments and presidential transitions.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote. They also said they would seek legal recourse should Garland deny their requests.",
      "Should Garland opt to hand over the report to Trump's incoming Justice Department for consideration, as the letter suggested, much of the decision-making could fall to the president-elect's current defense team who will hold key leadership positions within the department, and his selection for attorney general, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",

      "Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira asked Judge Aileen Cannon to stop the release of the report, arguing they would \"suffer harm as civilian casualties\" to the case. The pair were charged alongside Trump as part of an alleged effort to obstruct the classified documents probe. Both men pleaded not guilty and in Monday's letter accused Smith of improper motivations.",
      "While Smith dropped his appeal of the case against Trump citing Justice Department policy, he opted to keep going with the appeal in Nauta and de Oliveira's case in an effort to reverse the legal precedent created by Cannon's ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed.",
      "On Monday, attorneys for the men turned to Cannon, urging her to step in and stop the special counsel from completing his report. They alleged such a move would be improper after the judge had previously dismissed the case. They also contended any public release could affect the ongoing appeal and infringe on the defendants' rights.",
      "\"The Final Report is meant to serve as a Government verdict against the Defendants contrary to all criminal justice norms and constitutional guideposts,\" the attorneys wrote. \"The filing of such a report, by an unauthorized person, is clearly improper in this context and will cause grave harm given the pendency of criminal proceedings, now on appeal, at counsel Smith's own insistence.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment.",
      "The news comes days after a top lieutenant to the special counsel, Jay Bratt, retired from the Justice Department. Bratt, a 34-year federal prosecutor and former head of the Justice Department's counterintelligence section, played a key role in the origins of the classified documents probe and went on to prosecute the case against Trump as part of Smith's team.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 21:27:10 -0500",
    "summary": "A 3-year-old boy has died of injuries in the massive explosion of fireworks at a home in Honolulu on New Year's Eve.",
    "story": [
      "A 3-year-old boy who died Monday was the fourth person to succumb to injuries from a massive explosion of fireworks on New Year's Eve at a Honolulu home, and a doctor said six others faced long recoveries in Arizona, where they were sent to be treated for severe burns.",
      "The blast also killed three women and injured more than 20 people, many of whom have burns over most of their bodies. Two of the people who were killed had been declared dead at the scene.",
      "The Honolulu medical examiner identified the toddler as Cassius Ramos-Benigno. The cause and manner of death were listed as pending.",
      "The child's death comes a few days after Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said at a press conference following the explosion on New Year's Day, \"I think that there is likely going to be one or two children under age 10 that will be either forever disfigured or dead in the coming hours.\"",
      "The U.S. military flew six of the injured to Phoenix for treatment on Saturday because Hawaii's lone burn center doesn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "After the disaster, Hawaii's leaders intensified their oft-repeated calls to crack down on the state's vast illegal fireworks trade with stepped-up enforcement and greater penalties.",
      "Green had said authorities intercepted 187,000 pounds of illegal fireworks in 2023 and more than 40,000 pounds this year.",
      "The six taken to Arizona are all in their 20s or 30s and have extensive burns, Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center, said at a news conference streamed online.",
      "The person with the least has burns over 45% of their body while the most has burns over nearly 80% of their body. Each of the six is using a breathing tube and most are in medically induced comas.",
      "Foster said they are all doing \"very well\" and have good vital signs. But it will be six months to a year before any are able to return to anything resembling a normal life, Foster said. Four patients will likely have to remain intubated and in a coma for months, he said.",
      "The patients will likely suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, Foster said, adding the burn center has two full-time psychologists and a psychiatrist hospital on staff to help them.",
      "\"There's something uniquely and particularly horrifying about being burned, especially from this type of injury,\" Foster said. \"And we anticipate that all of these patients are going to have some adjustment issues.\"",
      "Many required emergency surgery before leaving Hawaii and a number had traumatic injuries in addition to burns, because of the explosions and resulting projectiles, he said.",
      "The Arizona Burn Center operated on all six on Sunday, performed three other surgeries Monday and plan three others Tuesday. By then, doctors should be done with removing burns and will progress to closing wounds and grafting skin, Foster said. Infections are the most dangerous and feared complication for burn patients, he said, while also predicting all would likely get them at some point.",
      "\"It's just the way burn injury works, especially when you have large percent-of-total-body-surface-area burns like this,\" Foster said.",
      "The scars, and the physical limitations that come with them, will likely be the biggest thing that the patients have to deal with and are what will make these wounds lifelong injuries, he said.",
      "Foundations affiliated with the burn center and the hospital it is a part of, Valleywise\u202fHealth, are providing housing for patient relatives. Some burn center employees have even volunteered their homes, Foster said.",
      "Hawaii's diverse population has long celebrated New Year's with fireworks, but in recent years, professional-grade aerial explosives have been growing in popularity even though they are illegal for amateurs. Neighborhoods across Oahu light up for hours as residents launch aerial fireworks into the sky from the narrow streets in front of their homes.",
      "Honolulu authorities say a person attending a party lit a bundle of aerial fireworks, which fell on its side and shot explosives into two crates that contained additional aerials. Video of the resulting explosion shows a rapid series of blasts shooting fireworks in the air and around the front of a house.",
      "Hawaii's counties have varying rules on other types of fireworks. On Oahu, the state's most populous island, only certain types of firecrackers are allowed to be used during specific timeframes on New Year's Eve, Chinese New Year and Fourth of July. However, many residents set off fireworks of all kinds year-round.",

The attacker is dead, and FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia said the attack was an act of terrorism. The FBI has identified the man responsible as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas and Army veteran who had posted several videos proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "The president and first lady on Monday afternoon laid flowers at a memorial site on Bourbon Street and stood in silence with their heads bowed. They later attended an interfaith prayer service hosted by the Archdiocese of New Orleans at the Cathedral-Basilica of Saint Louis. The president privately met with the grieving families, survivors and local law enforcement ahead of the evening vigil, the White House said.",

    "summary": "A confidential report warned that bollards needed to be fixed. New Orleans didn't start to replace them for five years.",
    "story": [
      "A 2017 report by the city of New Orleans identified Bourbon Street as a potential terrorism target, citing FBI warnings and announcing the installation of bollards to protect pedestrians from possible vehicle ramming attacks.",
      "The report, released in January of that year, highlighted the dense pedestrian crowds on Bourbon Street as a vulnerability. \"This presents a risk and target for terrorism and the FBI has identified it as a concern that the City must address,\" the report stated.",
      "Eight years later, U.S. Army veteran Shamsud-din Jabbar, who officials say pledged allegiance to ISIS, drove a truck nearly three blocks down Bourbon Street, killing 14 people. The bollards installed in 2017 to help prevent such attacks were undergoing replacement ahead of the Super Bowl, which New Orleans will host on Feb. 9.",
      "A confidential report reviewed by CBS News showed that city officials were warned in 2019 that bollards needed to be fixed and improved \"immediately.\" Debris had caused some of the removable barriers to become inoperable, the report said, even as construction was underway to install additional bollards along the same street.",
      "The report was written by New York-based security consultancy Interfor International and submitted to the French Quarter Management District, a state group that manages the area, in November 2019.",
      "\"The risk of terrorism - specifically mass shootings and vehicular attacks - remains highly possible while moderately probable,\" the report states.",
      "\"Interfor strongly recommends bollard mobilization to be fixed/improved immediately,\" the report later said, adding that the New Orleans Police Department was best positioned to oversee the improvements.",
      "The CEO of Interfor International, Don Aviv, told CBS News he did not hear from the management district again after they published a summary of the confidential report in August 2020.",
      "\"That was abnormal,\" Aviv said, adding that they usually brought in to present strategies and methodologies to follow up on recommendations.",
      "An update from Mayor LaToya Cantrell's office that same month said the city had started to assess and repair the bollards. Four years later, minutes from an April 2024 meeting showed the Department of Public Works was still \"looking into replacements\" for the bollards on Bourbon Street.",
      "Construction work to replace the bollards didn't begin until November 2024, five years after the report that recommended they be fixed immediately. An online bulletin from Dec. 19 showed that bollards were being installed near where Jabbar mounted the pavement to enter Bourbon Street.",
      "Following the attack, New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said police had taken actions to \"harden those target areas where the bollards\" previously were by installing patrol cars and other measures. \"We did have a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there, and they still got around.\"",
      "Officials have also said that the bollards alone would not have prevented an attack, and would not have stopped the attacker from mounting the sidewalk. Temporary, moveable steel barriers that the city has previously used to block sidewalks were not deployed on Bourbon Street on New Year's Eve.",
      "However, a June 2017 report published by the city's Department of Public Works, prepared by infrastructure consulting firm AECOM, cited bollards as a way to save lives during such an attack.",
      "The report drew comparisons to vehicle ramming attacks in Nice, France, and in New York's Times Square, where fixed bollards were credited with saving lives. It proposed operable bollards for Bourbon Street to prevent unauthorized vehicle access while maintaining flexibility.",
      "Unlike the fixed bollards in New York City, the report noted that the proposed bollards would be removable, accommodating delivery vehicles and emergency access. Permanent installations had faced opposition over concerns they could restrict access to businesses.",
      "\"The City has developed affordable options for using operable bollards to control access along Bourbon Street,\" the report said. \"When closed, these bollards will provide sufficient protection to prevent any unauthorized vehicle from accessing the roadway.\"",
      "New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced in an FBI news conference Sunday the city is reviewing the newly installed bollards amid concerns they may only withstand vehicle impacts at speeds of up to 10 miles per hour.",
      "\"The thorough assessment that I am asking for will determine whether they are strong enough,\" Cantrell said. \"I can't say with surety that's the case but an expert will be able to do so, and we'll respond accordingly.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the district said: \"The French Quarter Management District had nothing to do with the selection or contracting process for the Bourbon Street bollards; that decision was made by the Mayor's Office/ The Department of Public Works for the City of New Orleans.\"",

      "Along with that softening of disapproval comes majority-Republican support for Donald Trump to pardon those who forced their way into the Capitol, something most Americans overall would oppose.",
      "Overall, there is more public opposition to the actions of those who forced their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6 than there is to pardons for those actions. This is partly because most of those who somewhat disapprove of the Jan. 6 attack, rather than strongly disapprove of it, favor Trump pardons for those involved \u2014 a group that includes many Republicans and 2024 Trump voters.",

    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",

      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 15:20:10 -0500",
    "summary": "If approved by a federal judge, the agreement means the military would help thousands of veterans seek honorable discharges.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon has reached a historic legal settlement with more than 35,000 gay and lesbian military veterans who were dismissed because of their sexual orientation, and in many cases denied an honorable discharge and the array of services they had earned, CBS News has learned.",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, veterans whose discharge papers reference their sexual orientation as a reason for their separation from the military can now avoid a cumbersome legal process and be re-issued paperwork that eliminates any reference to their sexuality. If they were denied an honorable discharge, they will also be eligible for an immediate upgrade review, the agreement says.",
      "\"When I was discharged because of my sexual orientation, I felt that my country was telling me that my service was not valuable \u2013 that I was 'less than' because of who I loved,\" said Sherrill Farrell, a U.S. Navy veteran who was a plaintiff in the case. \"Today, I am once again proud to have served my country by standing up for veterans like myself, and ensuring our honor is recognized.\"",
      "The settlement, which still must receive approval from a federal judge, would resolve the claims from a group of LGBTQ+ veterans who were kicked out of the military years ago because of their sexual orientation. The veterans filed a federal civil rights suit in August 2023 over the Defense Department's failure to grant them honorable discharges or remove biased language specifying their sexuality from their service records following the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" in 2011.",
      "The class action lawsuit, which was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims the Pentagon's failure to correct this \"ongoing discrimination\" represents a violation of constitutional rights.",
      "It's been more than a decade since the military lifted its longstanding ban on openly gay and lesbian troops. But thousands of those discharged under past discriminatory policies like \"don't ask, don't tell\" are still carrying less than honorable discharges today, depriving them of the full spectrum of benefits including VA loan programs, college tuition assistance, health care and some jobs.",
      "A CBS News investigation has documented the Pentagon's long-running failure to restore honor to the service records of thousands of veterans who were deprived of veterans benefits after their military careers were cut short. A series of reports documented the ways these veterans' often traumatic separation from the military shaped the course of their lives.",
      "The settlement would establish a streamlined process for LGBTQ+ veterans who were discharged honorably but whose dismissal was attributed to their sexual orientation \u2014 enabling them to be re-issued papers that make no reference to it. And for those who were denied an honorable discharge, the Pentagon would commit to a streamlined upgrade review process.",
      "\"This proposed settlement delivers long-overdue justice to LGBTQ+ veterans who served our country with honor but were stripped of the dignity and recognition they rightfully earned due to discriminatory discharge policies,\" said Elizabeth Kristen, a senior staff attorney with Legal Aid at Work, a group that helped file the suit. \"It marks a crucial step in addressing this deep-seated injustice and ensuring these veterans receive the acknowledgment and respect they have long been denied.\"",
      "The Pentagon has issued a series of pledges in the past year to right the wrongs inflicted on gay and lesbian service members in the past year. Both the Pentagon and the Department of Justice declined comment on the proposed settlement when reached Monday.",
      "At the time the civil rights suit was filed, a Pentagon spokesman said the military had made attempts to streamline the upgrade process to a short, two-page application. The department said legal representation was no longer required to apply for a discharge review and that the discharge review boards \"continue to strive to finalize 90% of all cases within 10 months as required by statute.\"",
      "But the lawsuit, prepared by the Impact Fund, Legal Aid at Work and the law firms King & Spalding LLP and Haynes & Boone LLP, called that a \"constitutionally inadequate\" response, saying it placed the burden on individual veterans to spend months or years obtaining old personnel records before they could file the applications. Those reviews would then take months or years to be processed, they alleged.",
      "The lawsuit did not seek monetary damages, though the settlement allows the court to approve a $350,000 payment by the Pentagon to cover the plaintiffs' legal costs.",
      "\"This case is not about damages,\" Jocelyn Larkin, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said at the time it was filed. \"This case is about simply changing that piece of paper because the effect of changing that piece of paper is so incredibly consequential for our clients.\"",
      "While the full scope of past discrimination against gay and lesbian service members remains unknown, Larkin believes the lawsuit could at least help some 35,000 veterans already identified by a Defense Department Freedom of Information Act request, first reported by CBS News in June 2023. The true figure could be significantly higher. According to the most recent data available from the Pentagon, just 1,375 veterans have been granted relief in the form of a discharge upgrade or correction to their record.",

    "story": [
      "The New Year is starting with a fresh warning for those who work with animals in Texas. The state's Parks and Wildlife Department is asking hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts to watch out for animals that may be impacted by dangerous \"maneater\" parasites from flies that lay eggs in open wounds, nostrils, eyes and mouths.",
      "The advisory, posted by the department on Dec. 30, was issued for outdoor enthusiasts in South Texas after the New World Screwworm was recently found in a cow in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas.",
      "According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the New World Screwworm has been making its way further north through the Americas.",
      "\"As a protective measure, animal health officials ask those along the southern Texas border to monitor wildlife, livestock and pets for clinical signs of NWS and immediately report potential cases,\" the department said.",
      "What is the New World Screwworm?",
      "According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the New World Screwworm \"is a devastating pest.\"",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the USDA says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds, and in rare cases, people.\"",
      "The Texas parks department says the maggots will lay eggs in \"open wounds or orifices of live tissue such as nostrils, eyes or mouth.\" Such an infestation is known as New World screwworm myiasis.",
      "\"These eggs hatch into dangerous parasitic larvae, and the maggots burrow or screw into flesh with sharp mouth hooks. Wounds can become larger, and an infestation can often cause serious, deadly damage or death to the infected animal.\"",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"maneater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"It is an appropriate name,\" the agency added, saying that the screwworm was once prevalent in the U.S., with 230,000 cases reported just in 1935. But then scientists developed a way to release sterilized male blow flies, and since female blow flies only mate once, the agency says it \"effectively removed that female and her potential offspring from the population.\"",
      "It's believed that the elimination of the New World Screwworm has saved U.S. agriculture workers nearly $900 million in lost livestock annually, the agency said.",
      "Where are New World Screwworms found?",
      "New World Screwworms are endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and countries in South America. The USDA says that cases of the parasite, however, are also spreading north to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.",
      "\"Although USDA eradicated NWS from the United States in 1966 using sterile insect technique, there is a constant risk of re-introduction into the United States,\" the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service says. \"To prevent the northward movement of this pest from South America to NWS-free areas in Central and North America, APHIS collaborates with Panama to maintain a barrier zone in eastern Panama.\"",
      "What to know about New World Screwworm Myiasis",
      "The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says that female New World Screwworm flies are \"drawn to the odor of a wound or natural opening on a live, warm-blooded animal.\" There, just one fly can lay up to 300 eggs at a time, and she may lay up to 3,000 eggs during her lifetime.",
      "After eggs hatch, they become larvae or maggots that burrow into an opening to feed. Once they feed, they drop to the ground, burrow into the soil and emerge as adult flies. The adult flies can travel long distances, the department says, \"and the movement of infested livestock or wildlife can increase the rate of spread.\"",
      "Signs of NWS Myiasis include irritated or depressed behavior, loss of appetite, head shaking, the smell of decaying flesh, the presence of maggots in wounds and isolation from other animals or people.",
      "To prevent an infestation, Texas officials say to clean and cover all wounds when spending time outdoors, especially in NWS-affected areas, and to apply insect repellant to outdoor clothing.",

      "Beijing \u2014 \u00a0A strong earthquake killed at least 53 people in Tibet on Tuesday and left many others trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the region of western China and across the border in Nepal.",
      "The official Xinhua News Agency said 62 other people were injured, citing the regional disaster relief headquarters.",
      "About 1,500 fire and rescue workers were deployed to search for people in the rubble, the Ministry of Emergency Management said.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 6 miles. China recorded the magnitude as 6.8.",
      "The epicenter was about 50 miles northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the border. The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world's tallest peaks.",

      "State broadcaster CCTV said there are a handful of communities within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter, which was 380 kilometers (240 miles) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, known as Xigaze in Chinese.",
      "About 140 miles away in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes, into the streets. No information was immediately available from the remote, mountainous areas of Nepal closer to the epicenter.",

    "summary": "The human metapneumovirus is reportedly surging in China, but should Americans be concerned? Here's what to know about HMPV symptoms and more.",
    "story": [
      "The human metapneumovirus, also known as HMPV, is reportedly surging in China, raising questions about what the illness is and if it's a concern to those in the U.S.",
      "Chinese health officials have not confirmed that HMPV is what is driving hospitalizations in the country, and recent reports from China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicate the increase may actually be due to influenza A. But with less public knowledge around HMPV in the U.S., worries of a potential new pandemic have risen \u2014 though experts say there isn't need for alarm.",
      "\"The concern for a pandemic can be put at rest,\"\u00a0Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno,\u00a0Children's Medical Center Plano director of infection prevention and control, told CBS News, adding not only is the virus fairly stable, it's also not a novel virus like COVID-19 was. \"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity against this human metapneumovirus.\"",
      "What is HMPV?",
      "HMPV is a virus that can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus.",
      "The length of illness varies depending on the severity on an individual's case but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "HMPV symptoms",
      "According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include:",
      "CoughFeverNasal congestionShortness of breath",
      "Cough",
      "Fever",
      "Nasal congestion",
      "Shortness of breath",
      "\"Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections,\" the CDC's website notes.",
      "Is HMPV a new virus?",
      "HMPV is not new. It was first discovered in 2001 and is part of the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, according to the CDC.",
      "It may have been circulating even earlier \u2014 for decades or over a century, Garcia Carreno said.",
      "In the U.S., HMPV typically circulates beginning in the winter and lasts until or through spring, the CDC says, and can circulate simultaneously with RSV and the flu during the respiratory virus season.",
      "Is HMPV worse than COVID?",
      "Experts say the HMPV outbreak in China is not of major concern \u2014 it is neither a new, mystery illness nor responsible for as many cases as COVID or other infections even this season. According to the latest CDC data, HMPV accounts for less than 2% of weekly positive tests of respiratory viruses. In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week.",
      "For a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks. At 1.9%, Garcia Carreno said it's not close to the numbers of flu, COVID and RSV.",
      "Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "\"Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia,\" the clinic's website adds.",
      "HMPV transmission and prevention",
      "HMPV is transmitted through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus.",
      "\"Unfortunately, compared to flu, RSV and COVID, we don't have a vaccine for human metapneumovirus, so we don't have that advantage of priming over or boosting our immune system to fight these viruses,\" said Garcia Carreno. \"But still, everything else that we learned for COVID can apply to methane.\"",
      "To prevent illness, take similar steps to preventing other respiratory viruses, meaning wash hands with soap and water and avoid close contact with sick people.",
      "\"If somebody's sick, try to avoid crowding so they don't expose everybody, especially the vulnerable people,\" said Garcia Carreno. \"If that person is sick and can not avoid going to a place where other people are, then try to use a mask, use cough and sneezing etiquette and good hand washing.\"",

      "Mr. Biden said in his meeting that the U.S. will continue to hold Maduro and his representatives accountable for their anti-democratic and repressive actions, accoring to the official White House readout.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez told reporters that they had a long, fruitful, and cordial conversation and thanked Mr. Biden for his support. His team is also in touch with President-elect Donald Trump's team.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez's White House visit is the first stop on an international tour of defiance to Venezuelan inauguration and gathering of international support. He has been living in exile in Spain since a Venezuelan judge issued an arrest warrant following the July presidential election.",
      "Venezuela's National Electoral Council declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. Electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, unlike previous presidential elections.",
      "Ahead of the elections, the United States made a bargain with the Maduro government that the U.S. would temporarily lift some sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas in exchange for a commitment for a free and fair election.",
      "The Maduro regime did not uphold its end of the agreement and sanctions were reinstated. In September, the U.S. sanctioned 180 Venezuelan officials for not accepting the results of the election and committing human rights abuses including killings, repression, and mass detention of protesters."

      "The police official in charge of the investigation, Marcos Veloso, told a press conference on Monday that there was \"strong evidence\" incriminating the family member who was arrested.",
      "Her identity was not revealed by the police, but Brazilian media reported she was the daughter-in-law of the woman who prepared the cake.\u00a0G1 reported that the woman researched about arsenic on the internet before the incident, officials confirmed to RBS TV.",

      "Veloso said the family members had noticed a \"spicy\" and \"unpleasant\" flavor to the cake. The woman who baked the cake asked them to stop eating it, but it was too late.",
      "Six relatives were hospitalized. Two sisters, aged 58 and 65, as well as the 43-year-old daughter of the eldest sister, died within hours of each other.",

      "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer hit back at Elon Musk on Monday after the world's richest man repeatedly lobbed a host of inflammatory allegations at the country's leader over his government's record on a long-running national child grooming scandal.",
      "Musk has accused the United Kingdom leader of being \"complicit in the rape of Britain\" on his X platform and has repeatedly elevated claims without evidence that Starmer knowingly refused to prosecute child groomers when he was the country's top lawyer.",
      "Throughout the past 48 hours alone, Musk has called for Starmer to be imprisoned and posted a poll to his X followers posing the question as to whether \"America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.\"",
      "While the British leader did not name Musk directly, he widely condemned what he said was the spread of false information.",

      "Musk's barbs are in reference to a years-long scandal in Britain over the state's response to child sexual exploitation and grooming gangs, mostly consisting of Pakistani men, who targeted vulnerable young girls in multiple towns across northern England.",
      "A 2014 government-commissioned report found that some 1,400 vulnerable children were targeted and sexually abused in the town of\u00a0 Rotherham\u2013 the largest specific case of child grooming in the country\u2014 between 1997 and 2013. The report detailed how children as young as 11 years old were subject to trafficking, rape and other forms of physical assault.",
      "That report was heavily critical of \"the collective failures of political and officer leadership\" and said that \"growing evidence that child sexual exploitation was a serious problem in Rotherham\" was ignored and even suppressed by authorities.",
      "Starmer served as director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, a role that in practice made him the top prosecutor in the country when the child grooming scandals came to light.",

      "Until briefly imposing martial law on December 3, Yoon had been a darling of President Joe Biden's administration for his pro-U.S. policies on the global stage.

When it does, it will be on the basis of the plan that President Biden put forward and that virtually the entire world supports.\"",

    "summary": "On a lakeside peninsula in Eastern Africa, archaeologists have found clues about a society that lived there over 3 million years ago.",
    "story": [
      "On a lakeside peninsula in Eastern Africa, archaeologists have found clues about a society that lived there over 3 million years ago.",
      "The Homa Peninsula, in Kenya, is part of the East African Rift Valley, a part of the world often called \"the cradle of humankind.\" So many of the oldest clues about humanity's earliest days have been preserved under the valley's fertile, human soil, including the remains of \"Lucy,\" an ancient human relative who lived more than 3 million years ago.",
      "Tom Plummer and his team are the latest to make discoveries in the area, working at a site on the peninsula called Nyanga. The team found flakes, or little knives, at the dig site. The blades are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth \u2014 and even after more than 3 million years, they still have a sharp edge.",
      "Plummer, an archaeologist at the City University of New York, said the blades were made by hammering one stone against each other. The knives would have been used to peel and cut fruits and vegetables, and to cut the flesh off prey like hippos, Plummer said. The meat would then be pounded between stones to tenderize it. The knife and stones are known as the Oldowan tool kit, and likely set the stage for further technology advancement down the line.",
      "\"I \u00a0think the Oldowan technology is probably the most important technological innovation that ever happened in human history,\" Plummer told \"CBS Saturday Morning.\"",
      "\"It allowed (the pre-human ancestors) to access a whole array of foods that they would never have had access to before.\"",
      "Plummer said that new diet would have fueled body and brain growth, starting a \"feedback loop\" that created more sophisticated beings who \"start doing more with technology.\" An similar, even older cutting tool was also found in Kenya, but that technology apparently died out, so Plummer believes this tool is the one that can be credited for those developments.",
      "\"I think that's all starting with the Oldowan,\" Plummer said.",
      "Who made the tools is another surprise. Along with the tools, Plummer's team found the tooth of a paranthropus, an early hominin that is not a direct ancestor of humans. That suggests that the first tool making is not a human legacy, but an idea humanity's ancestors copied, then used to dominate other hominins, who ultimately died out.",
      "Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, said that discovery can help frame humans' existence on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "Searching for pre-human history",
      "The search for these early artifacts has the look and intrigue of an \"Indiana Jones\" film. Finding the splintered rocks that showed evidence of being used as tools was one thing, but the archaeology team then had to find the cut marks on animal bones that confirmed how the knives were being used.",
      "Blasto Onyango, a local archaeological legend who helped uncover the Turkana Boy, the most complete early hominin skeleton ever discovered, said that his impressive find took \"four or five years\" to find. As the time passed, he and other archaeologists found \"different parts of the\" skeleton, working slowly but surely to uncover the remains of a young boy who lived over one and a half million years ago.",
      "Paleontology researcher Rose Nyaboke said that kind of painstaking, slow research is what makes up the day-to-day work of an archaeology dig. Sometimes, she and other researchers find small pieces of bone, but have to leave those fragments where they were found.",
      "\"We don't just pick anything. It has to have a paleontological meaning,\" Nyaboke explained. \"We tell it 'Sorry. We can't pick you today.'\"",
      "The bones that matter are ones that can lend context to the area, such as pig's teeth. Pigs evolved so quickly their skeletons help date the surrounding area. The site is too old for carbon dating, and the ancient volcanic ash that has preserved the artifacts makes other dating methods too hard to use. The area had actually been mostly abandoned by researchers after artifacts from the Homa Peninsula led to inaccurate claims about human origins. Despite all that, Potts started digging on the peninsula nearly 40 years ago.",
      "\"We found a place that's difficult to date, but we didn't leave, because science takes persistence,\" Potts said.",
      "That persistence has been rewarded with discoveries like Plummer's. New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "\"Some of the things that we thought occurred in a very short period of time, within the last one million years, are now stretched out over a 6 million year period,\" Potts said. \"That includes tool making.\"",

      "Upon learning that Schwarzenegger planned to ship the equipment overseas, the then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell, stepped in.",
      "\"He says, 'Arnold, I'm not gonna be that stupid and ship this over with a ship, but you never heard that,'\" Schwarzenegger told Jocko. \"'I'm gonna fly the f---ing thing over there. It's gonna be there in two days.'\"",
      "\"And then all of a sudden, three weeks later, I was getting letters from guys on the front lines saying, 'Thank you, Arnold, for helping us get these weights. We just received weights. We are now working at the barracks with the dumbbells and the barbells and stuff. We just don't have enough, obviously, because there's so many of us that are into weight training. But it is a great, great beginning,'\" Schwarzenegger remembered.",
      "Schwarzenegger was instrumental in bringing weight training equipment to military members. (Greg Mathieson/Mai/Getty Images)",
      "Schwarzenegger went on to recount how he traveled to visit the troops stationed in Iraq during the Second Gulf War in 2003. The actor made the trip to screen his film \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\"",
      "He said it was important to him that the men and women serving in Iraq \"be the first ones to see it before anyone else, any critic or anyone else sees it. I was very fanatic about that.\"",
      "\"I went to various different places over there to show them the movie,\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"That's when I saw, all of a sudden \u2014 gyms where they were working out. The craziest thing was when I went back there in 2009 . . . I saw gymnasiums that were much bigger than any gymnasium in the world.\"",

      "\"It was insane,\" he continued. \"That's when I realized that we have now gotten to the point where there is no fire station that doesn't have weights, no police station that doesn't have weights, no military station that doesn't have weights.\"",
      "\"This is what happened in the period between the '70s and the '90s. It was an explosion in every direction,\" he added. \"And that was my way of being useful. I believe in this. I feel passionate about this.\"",
      "\"Because I felt like the bigger I make the sport, the healthier the people are going to get.\"",

      "Princess Diana's biographer Andrew Morton, author of \"The Queen: Her Story,\" weighs in on the future for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.",
      "COMMENTARY: Some might suggest that 2024 was not the best year for the British royal family, but as we take a peek back at what went right and wrong, what can we look forward to in 2025?",
      "As we all know, Princess Catherine had the most devastating year when it was announced that she was suffering from cancer, but good things came out of the bad and, according to a very well-placed source, Catherine has rediscovered herself as an individual and, more importantly, is now looking forward to returning to full-time royal duties with a renewed vigor. However, this is not without its initial problems.",
      "This is simply because she\u2019s rediscovered the joys of motherhood and spending time away from the media spotlight, something she\u2019s had to live with for the last 12 years plus since her marriage to Prince William. He himself, though, has mainly flown solo this year and admitted in an interview that it had been a brutal year.",

      "But a huge turning point in William\u2019s life happened only last month, and that was his meeting with the 47th President-elect, Donald J. Trump. The two were at the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral with William representing His Majesty the King, who has had limited travel due to his own health issues.",
      "Prince William met with President-elect Donald J. Trump in France at the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. (Ludovic Marin)",
      "But what truly emerged was William not only engaging incredibly well with President-elect Trump, but also receiving high praise, which reverberated around the world. According to my sources, both William and Catherine, along with the King and Queen, have all been invited to Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20 in Washington, D.C.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, has been reactivating all the charitable good works that she started out with in 2023, which came predominantly to a shuddering halt with her cancer diagnosis.",
      "What is really going on behind the scenes is simply this: both William and Catherine are being fast-tracked to take on more royal duties and this is the simple fact of age. As we all know, his Majesty the King and the Queen are now in their 70s.",
      "Unlike the previous Prince of Wales, William does not have the luxury of time, and Catherine also knows that once the inevitable does happen, her life will change beyond all recognition, regardless of her children's ages, and can only hark back to the very young Queen Elizabeth and how she had to dedicate her life to the crown.",
      "Both Prince William and Kate Middleton are being fast-tracked to take on more royal duties as King Charles and Queen Camilla are now in their 70s.\u00a0 (Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)",
      "Expect to see a more developing role from the young Prince George in 2025. We saw a streak of independence at the Christmas walkabout when, for the first time, the 11-year-old broke away from his parents to independently meet the public. Once again, there will have to be a focus on the fact that he, too, will now be being fast-tracked behind the scenes into royal protocol and life.",

      "George is fully aware more than ever, having sat through his grandfather\u2019s coronation in May 2023, of just what the future holds, and according to a source, he knows exactly what the public, the Commonwealth and the world will expect of him. But as you can see, he is already a fine, capable, upstanding young man.",
      "Prince George understands what his future holds as second in line to the throne. (The Duchess of Cambridge/Kensington Palace via AP)",
      "Princess Charlotte is also becoming more and more independent and, according to our source, has been a rock to her mother, Princess Catherine, during the very difficult periods and dark moments of illness. My sources told me that Catherine is very much aware that, had Charlotte not been born into a royal family, she would\u2019ve simply enjoyed a life perhaps inside the dance arena. Ballet is a hobby that\u2019s truly taken time, thought, and dedication in the young Princess\u2019s life.",

      "Prince Andrew continues to dominate the news, but for all the wrong reasons. However, unlike certain royal relatives, he has resisted the temptation to try to rectify himself by writing a book. According to a well-placed source, Andrew at some point would like to see a low-key return to royal life, predominantly focusing on charitable works and also mostly out of the media spotlight.",
      "All that remains, of course, is the thorny topic of whether he can continue living at Royal Lodge, something he\u2019s fighting hard to keep.\u00a0According to a source, he sees that as a final bastion of independence and one that was promised to him by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth. Others might suggest, though, that this is something of a pipe dream and that he can never return to the royal fold, no matter what he wishes to do.",

      "As for the ex-Royals, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the biggest problem is simply money!",
      "This is because Prince Harry and Meghan have an extravagant lifestyle with a dedicated 24/7 security team and, of course, a sprawling mansion with their Netflix deal hanging by a thread after the colossal disaster of Prince Harry\u2019s polo show. Everything now hinges on Meghan Markle being able to cook up success in her forthcoming cooking show for the streaming company.",
      "Harry and Meghan continue to live in Montecito, California, with their two children. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)",
      "To brighten up our New Year, Meghan decided to post on her brand-new Instagram account, which has actually secretly been running for two years, but now she\u2019s admitted it. Well, her new cooking show for Netflix has finally arrived. Apparently she wants to wrap her arms around everyone so that we can enjoy food, gardening and friendship. You don\u2019t see any good-time friends like Gayle King, Oprah or, indeed, Ellen DeGeneres, but they are so 2024.",
      "The bottom line is, if this fails and does as well as Prince Harry\u2018s polo show, then, despite writing in the sand 2025 in her other Instagram post, she may wish that the waves wash over yet another obvious debacle.",
      "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle took trips to Nigeria and Colombia in 2024. (Photo by Eric Charbonneau/Archewell Foundation via Getty Images)",
      "The Sussexes had hoped, following their quasi-royal tours to Nigeria and Colombia, that many other countries would have been willing to book them. But with colossal fees attached for flights, security, and all that comes with having ex-members of the British monarchy in tow, it seems, so far, that not many countries have taken up this strange and bewildering offer.",
      "I\u2019m also told that Harry has closed the book on any more revealing tell-alls. Even though the original deal was for four books, it now appears that Harry has run out of steam and, more importantly, Penguin Random House, who paid a hefty signing-on fee, despite all the publicity so far, have not regained their initial outlay.",

      "Prince Harry, though, is still hopeful that his original dream of moving over to Africa and living out a quiet life is something that he could persuade his very media-demanding wife she could also benefit from. But many people realize that without the glare of the spotlight, Meghan finds it incredibly hard to even breathe.",

However, many people feel that the king in fact should slow down, take better care of his health and perhaps take time out, letting Catherine and William undertake some of the more demanding overseas tours.",
      "But Charles is adamant that he is not slowing down and relishing the opportunity of taking control and the direction of his own personal reign. However, 2025 looks as exciting and thrilling as the last year, and we are genuinely all truly grateful for the work, fun, glamour and hard work the British Royal Family brings us.",

      "Many people assume that the behavior itself is the problem, Jaffe said \u2014 but there is almost always an underlying reason for those unhealthy or harmful choices.",
      "\"The behavior was actually a medicine of sorts for a problematic undercurrent.\"",
      "\"The reason you do it is that at some point earlier in your life, there was pain or struggle or emotional discomfort,\" he said.",

      "\"We try to stop ourselves from doing what we don't like,\" he noted. \"Especially around New Year\u2019s, people might say, \u2018I'm going to stop eating bad foods or I'm going to stop being lazy.\u2019\"",

      "The most important aspect of kicking a bad habit is to replace the negative behavior with a positive one. (iStock)",
      "\"We have to stop trying to just eliminate bad habits \u2014 it doesn't work,\" Jaffe said. \"We have to replace them with something else.\"",
      "For example, if someone wants to quit smoking, they might keep gum or sunflower seeds in their pocket, he said.",
      "\"You just have to keep going.\"",
      "Or, if someone is too focused on work, that might mean letting go of some tasks and delegating them to other people.",

      "But the jockeying sheds light on a dilemma that Trump may face in a city that he controls, with both houses of Congress under Republican management (and Kamala Harris peacefully certifying the transfer of power yesterday, four years to the day after the Capitol riot).",
      "The flip side of nearly unlimited clout is that when things go wrong, there\u2019s no one else to blame.",
      "And then there\u2019s the black hole known as Congress. Having dragged Mike Johnson across the finish line in the election for speaker, by making calls even from his golf course, Trump now faces a dilemma after the Christmas debt ceiling battle that just delayed the budget fight until March.",
      "Using a process known as reconciliation, which lowers the threshold from 60 Senate votes to 51 \u2013 both parties have used this for party-line dominance \u2013 Trump favors \"one big beautiful bill.\" That would include budget cuts, energy deregulation, tax cuts, the border crackdown and other presidential priorities.",

That\u2019s because after reaching the limit for assistant jobs, the only alternative was to create a bunch of deputy slots.",
      "Wiles, for her part, has told Axios: \"I don't welcome people who want to work solo or be a star\u2026 My team and I will not tolerate backbiting, second-guessing inappropriately, or drama. These are counterproductive to the mission.\"",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the incoming press secretary, is also being deprived of the big office that has been used by her predecessors for at least three decades. That\u2019s going to another communications aide.",
      "I can remember being in that second-floor office when Mike McCurry was press secretary, and Bill Clinton walking in and chatting while I was working on my book \"Spin Cycle.\" The reason for the large office was the gaggles taking place with the press, and sometimes interviews, which could not be accommodated by most smallish West Wing offices.",
      "Anyone in Wiles\u2019 sensitive position would invariably upset some officials during a process that determines winners and losers. But Trump views her as a grandmother and doesn\u2019t yell at her the way he might at other officials over a disagreement.",
      "As for Elon Musk\u2019s powerful role, Trump enjoys the company of wealthy people, and the X owner is the richest person on the planet. So he has influence until he doesn\u2019t, if there is a future falling out.",

      "Hackers are exploiting browser extensions as a gateway to steal sensitive user data through a variety of methods. These compromised extensions are exposing over 2.6 million users to data exposure and credential theft, as reported by\u00a0The Hacker News.",
      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",
      "The first company to shed light on the campaign was cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven, one of whose employees were targeted by a phishing attack on December 24, allowing the threat actors to publish a malicious version of the extension.",
      "Once these malicious extensions are published and pass the Chrome Web Store's security review, they are made available to millions of users, putting them at risk of data theft. Attackers can use these extensions to exfiltrate browsing data, monitor user activity and even bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.",
      "In some cases, developers themselves may unknowingly include data-gathering code as part of a monetization software development kit, which stealthily exfiltrates detailed browsing data. This makes it difficult to determine whether a compromise is the result of a hacking campaign or an intentional inclusion by the developer.",

These emails often create a false sense of urgency, urging you to click on malicious links. Always verify the sender\u2019s email address and avoid clicking on links without double-checking their authenticity. When in doubt, go directly to the official website rather than using a provided link.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Having strong antivirus software is an essential line of defense against malicious software. These tools can detect and block malicious code, even if it has been embedded in browser extensions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install strong malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Limit extension permissions:\u00a0Be cautious about the permissions you grant to browser extensions. Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",
      "4) Limit the number of extensions: Only install extensions that are genuinely needed and regularly review and uninstall those no longer in use.",
      "5) Keep your browser updated: Always update your browser to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities exploited by malicious software. Using an outdated browser increases the risk of being targeted by attacks that could have been prevented with a simple update. Enable automatic updates to ensure you\u2019re always protected. If you are unsure how to update your browser, check out my\u00a0detailed guide for Google Chrome.",
      "6) Regularly audit your extensions: Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions and remove any that are unnecessary or pose potential security risks.",
      "7) Report suspicious extensions: If you encounter a suspicious extension, report it to the official browser extension marketplace.",

      "Here are seven essential steps to help you choose a reliable VPN and safeguard your online privacy.",
      "1. Stick to official app stores:\u00a0Always download apps from trusted platforms like the App Store for iOS or the Google Play Store for Android. These stores have built-in security measures that help detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites or third-party stores, as they are more likely to host malicious software. Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",
      "2. Pay attention to app permissions:\u00a0Be careful about the permissions you grant to apps during installation. A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "3. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement\u00a02FA for your VPN accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.",
      "4. Keep software updated: Regularly update all VPN-related software, including clients, servers and associated networking hardware, to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.",
      "5. Use strong encryption: Look for VPN services that use robust encryption protocols like AES-256 to protect your data.",
      "6. Monitor VPN traffic: Continuously monitor VPN traffic and logs for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.",
      "7. Invest in strong antivirus software: A strong antivirus program can help detect and remove malware before it compromises your device. Many antivirus apps also come with features like web protection, anti-phishing tools and the ability to scan new apps for threats. While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection. Look for a trusted name in cybersecurity when choosing an antivirus solution.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Fake VPN apps are everywhere, and they\u2019re bad news. They\u2019re not just useless. They can turn your device into a tool for cybercriminals. The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free. They often come with weak security, leak your data or demand permissions that put your privacy at risk. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your online activity, invest in a trusted, paid VPN service.",

      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",

Scammers can also buy shockingly detailed information about you, from your full name to your health care and financial information. These scams are the most dangerous, with the attackers knowing enough about you to breeze past many of your defenses.",

Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Always go to the source of the communication via official channels from a secure device to confirm what\u2019s happening. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Don\u2019t give out sensitive information: If a message or email can put you under enough pressure to do something you shouldn\u2019t (like follow a link to a phishing site), imagine what a phone call can do. Any request for personal information should raise red flags. If something seems off, hang up.",

      "4. Verify identities before handing over money or information: Always verify who you are dealing with before providing any personal details (name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial information, etc.) or money. If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails. Hang up or set the message aside, find the legitimate contact information for the organization in question and reach out through official channels (not social media) to confirm the request.",

      "In the early hours of Jan. 1, 2025, two horrific attacks shook the nation, raising serious questions about car-sharing platform security and potential terrorism links. In Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others.",
      "Meanwhile, in New Orleans, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, plowed into crowds on Bourbon Street, resulting in at least 15 fatalities and dozens of injuries.",

      "The Las Vegas incident",
      "At approximately 8:40 a.m. PT on Jan. 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck pulled up to the valet area of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Within 15 to 20 seconds, the vehicle exploded, killing the driver and injuring seven bystanders. Investigators discovered that the Cybertruck was packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters.",
      "The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of terrorism. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on social media that the explosion was caused by large fireworks or a bomb in the bed of the Cybertruck and was unrelated to the vehicle itself.",
      "The New Orleans attack",
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, rammed through police barricades on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter. The driver, identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an Army veteran from Texas, mowed down pedestrians over a three-block stretch while firing into the crowd.",
      "The attack resulted in at least 15 deaths and dozens of injuries. Jabbar was killed in a subsequent shootout with police. The FBI is treating this incident as an act of terrorism, noting that an Islamic State flag was found on the vehicle and improvised explosive devices were discovered inside.",
      "The Turo connection to both incidents",
      "Both vehicles used in these incidents were rented through\u00a0Turo, a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform. This connection has raised significant questions about the company's security measures and screening processes.",
      "What is Turo?",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with people looking to rent cars. Often described as the \"Airbnb for cars,\" Turo allows individuals to list their personal vehicles for rent, providing an alternative to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Founded in 2010 as RelayRides and rebranded to Turo in 2015, the company has grown into an international vehicle-sharing marketplace with more than 14 million users worldwide. Turo is available in more than 16,000 cities across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",

      "How does Turo work?",
      "The Turo process is straightforward:",
      "Listing: Car owners list their vehicles on the Turo platform, including details like make, model, price and availability.Booking: Renters search for available cars in their desired location and dates, then book directly through the Turo website or app.Verification: Both car owners and renters must verify their identities through the platform.Pick-up: Renters meet the car owner to pick up the vehicle or arrange for contactless check-in.Return: At the end of the rental period, the renter returns the car to the owner.",

      "Identity verification",
      "Background checks (though the specific extent of these checks is not clear)",
      "Turo requires users to upload a valid driver's license to the app to be cleared for use. In some instances, Turo may collect additional identity verification information such as photographs or scanned copies of driver's licenses, passports or other forms of identification.",
      "The company has stated that they were \"devastated\" by the recent events and that their trust and safety team is actively cooperating with law enforcement. Importantly, Turo said in a statement to CyberGuy, \"We do not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.\"",

      "Regulatory landscape for peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms",
      "The regulatory landscape for peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms like Turo is in a state of flux, with at least 13 states having enacted laws specifically governing this industry, distinct from regulations applied to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Turo has been proactive in advocating for additional regulations in various states to establish clearer operational guidelines. A significant development occurred in 2022 when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed SB 6715 into law, providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car-sharing operations in the state. This legislation aims to expand transportation options and create economic opportunities for New Yorkers while addressing safety and insurance concerns.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "These tragic events have highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the peer-to-peer car-sharing model. As investigations into these incidents continue, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of Turo's operations and security measures. The car-sharing industry may face calls for stricter regulations and enhanced screening processes. Turo and similar platforms might need to reevaluate and strengthen their security protocols to prevent such incidents in the future.",

Its amphibious capabilities allow it to navigate through mud, slush and even dive into rivers, emerging unscathed on the other side.",
      "What sets the RT-G apart is its rapid acceleration. It can hit speeds of about 19 mph in 2.5 seconds, giving it a significant advantage in pursuit scenarios. This quick burst of speed, combined with its ability to handle drops from knee-high ledges and potentially roll down staircases, makes it a persistent and resilient force in the field.",

      "THE FUTURE OF SECURITY JUST ROLLED IN, AND HER NAME IS ATHENA",
      "Advanced technology at its core",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G is equipped with an array of advanced sensors and technologies that make it a sophisticated piece of equipment. These include GPS for precise positioning, multiple cameras and ultrasonic sensors for environmental awareness, obstacle avoidance capabilities and threat and target tracking systems. These features enable the RT-G to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions with people and objects. Additionally, the robot uses gyroscopic self-stabilization to maintain its balance and keep its wide contact patch firmly on the ground, ensuring smooth and quiet operation.",

In Wenzhou, a city in China's Zhejiang province, these robotic spheres are assisting police patrols in commercial zones. This real-world trial is providing valuable insights into the effectiveness and practicality of the RT-G in actual law enforcement scenarios.",
      "However, despite its impressive capabilities, the RT-G is not without its limitations. Video footage shows that the robot can be somewhat unstable when making turns, and its pursuit capabilities may be easily thwarted by a flight of stairs. These challenges highlight the ongoing need for development and improvement in robotic law enforcement technology.",
      "Rotunbot RT-G (Logon Technology)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G's amphibious nature, high-speed capabilities and non-lethal arsenal make it a versatile tool for police forces. However, like any new technology, it raises questions about privacy, surveillance and the increasing automation of policing. The RT-G may be rolling into the future of law enforcement, but we must carefully consider the implications of deploying such advanced robotic systems in our communities.",

      "Beware scam calls: Avoid unknown numbers and protect your personal information. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson talks about the increasingly common scam.",
      "Receiving unexpected international calls can be a source of anxiety for many individuals. Whether it\u2019s a single ring from an unknown number or multiple missed calls from abroad, the uncertainty can leave you wondering about the implications for your privacy and security.",
      "Kathy S. recently reached out with a concern many of us can relate to: \"I have received calls from Beijing and Russia on my cellphone. I did not answer them. Can you tell me why this is happening? Is my phone at risk?\"",
      "If you've experienced similar calls, you're not alone. Let's examine this issue and discover what's really going on.",

      "A man receiving an international call on his cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of international call scams",
      "International call scams have become increasingly common in recent years. One particularly prevalent scam is known as \"Wangiri,\" which originates from Japan and means \"one-ring-and-cut.\" These scammers typically let your phone ring once or twice before hanging up, hoping to pique your curiosity and prompt a callback.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Why are you receiving these international scam calls?",
      "There are several reasons why you might be receiving calls from unfamiliar international numbers.",
      "Wangiri scam: Scammers use automated systems to call thousands of numbers, disconnecting after one ring. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate number, incurring significant charges.",
      "Telemarketing and robocalls: Some companies use international numbers to bypass local regulations and reach a wider audience.",
      "Number spoofing: Scammers can make their calls appear to come from different countries, tricking you into answering.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Is your phone at risk?",
      "While receiving unexpected international calls doesn't necessarily put your phone at immediate risk, there are several potential dangers to be aware of.\u00a0The primary risk lies in potential financial losses if you engage with these scammers. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate service number owned by the fraudster. You could also be charged heavily for these calls, with the scammer aiming to keep you on the line to increase the billed amount.",
      "While less common with Wangiri scams, there's always a risk of personal information theft if you engage with unknown callers. Sharing sensitive data like bank account numbers or Social Security numbers could lead to identity theft.",
      "Answering or returning these calls may signal to scammers that your number is active, potentially leading to more scam calls in the future. Although not typically associated with Wangiri scams, some sophisticated phone scams can potentially install malware on your device if you click on certain links, prompts or follow instructions given by the scammer.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself",
      "While these international calls can be concerning, there are several steps you can take to safeguard yourself and your personal information. Here are six effective strategies to help protect against potential scams and unwanted calls.",
      "1) Don't answer or call back: If you receive a call from an unknown international number, resist the urge to answer or return the call.",
      "2) Block suspicious numbers: Use your phone's built-in features to\u00a0block these numbers and prevent future calls.",
      "3) Report the calls: Inform your phone carrier and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about these suspicious calls.",
      "4) Use call-blocking apps: Consider installing\u00a0call-blocking apps to identify and block spam calls.",
      "5) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive data over the phone, especially with unfamiliar callers.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using services that remove your personal data from the internet, reducing the chances of scammers obtaining your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "While unexpected international calls can be alarming, understanding the nature of these scams empowers you to protect yourself. By staying informed and following the preventive measures outlined above, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to these schemes. Remember, your best defense is a combination of caution, awareness and proactive steps to safeguard your personal information.",

    "summary": "Two men who were among the 37 federal inmates on death row whose sentences were commuted by President Biden are rejecting clemency.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' Brooke Singman provides details on President Biden's record-setting act of clemency.",
      "Two of the 37 inmates on federal death row whose sentences were commuted to life without parole last month by President Biden are rejecting clemency.",
      "Shannon Agofsky, 53, and Len Davis, 60, who are both in the\u00a0U.S. Penitentiary in\u00a0Terre Haute, Indiana, are refusing to sign the paperwork to accept the president's clemency action due to the legal avenues they are afforded on death row, according to court documents.",
      "The pair filed emergency motions in federal court on Dec. 30 requesting an injunction to block the change to their death sentences, saying that accepting their commutations would remove the heightened scrutiny that death penalty appeals receive.",
      "Heightened scrutiny is a legal process in which the courts examine cases like death penalty appeals closer for errors because these cases are a matter of life or death.",
      "BIDEN COMMUTES SENTENCES OF 37 FEDERAL DEATH ROW INMATES IN FINAL MONTH OF PRESIDENCY",
      "Two of the 37 federal inmates on death row whose sentences were commuted to life without parole by President Biden are rejecting clemency. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)",
      "\"To commute his sentence now, while the defendant has active litigation in court, is to strip him of the protection of heightened scrutiny,\" Agofsky's filing reads. \"This constitutes an undue burden, and leaves the defendant in a position of fundamental unfairness, which would decimate his pending appellate procedures.\"",
      "Davis, a former New Orleans police officer, \"has always maintained that having a death sentence would draw attention to the overwhelming misconduct\" against the Justice Department, he wrote in his filing.",
      "But, as Davis noted, case law on this issue is \"quite murky\" and there is no guarantee the two inmates can have their death sentences restored.",
      "Notably, the Supreme Court ruled in 1927 that a president may grant reprieves and pardons without the convict's consent. Both inmates wrote in their filings that they never requested commutation.",
      "BIDEN'S RATIONALE BEHIND CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR DEATH ROW KILLERS FOGGY AT BEST: EXPERT",
      "A jury convicted Agofsky in the 1989 murder of Dan Short, an Oklahoma bank president. His body was found in a lake after prosecutors said Agofsky and his brother, Joseph Agofsky, kidnapped and killed Short before stealing $71,000 from the bank.",
      "Joseph Agofsky was found not guilty of murder, but was sentenced to life in prison for the robbery. He died behind bars in 2013.",
      "Shannon Agofsky was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted on murder and robbery charges.\u00a0 He was later convicted in the 2001 stomping death of fellow inmate, Luther Plant, while he was incarcerated in a Texas prison. A jury recommended a death sentence in that case in 2004.",
      "A Texas jury recommended Shannon Agofsky be sentenced to death after he was convicted of killing a fellow inmate while incarcerated.\u00a0 (AP)",
      "Agofsky said in his filing last week that he is disputing how he was charged with murder in Plant's death and that he is also seeking to \"establish his innocence in the original case for which he was incarcerated.\"",
      "His wife, Laura, who married him in 2019 over the phone, told NBC News that his lawyers had encouraged him to seek a presidential commutation, but he refused because he was afforded legal counsel crucial in his appeals as a death row inmate.

      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the Catholic community in our nation\u2019s capital and for the confidence His Holiness has placed in me, but I have truly loved the last ten years I\u2019ve spent as bishop of San Diego,\" McElroy said in a statement, according to the Washington Post. \"I have never in my life felt more welcomed, more supported or more rewarded.\"",

      "McElroy was an open critic of Trump during his first administration regarding immigration and the border wall, among other issues.",
      "Just a month into Trump's first presidency, McElroy, a bishop at the time, notably said in a speech before a February 2017 conference of faith groups in California that \"well now, we all must become disruptors.\"\u00a0\"We must disrupt those who would seek to send troops into our streets to deport the undocumented, to rip mothers and fathers from their families. We must disrupt those who portray refugees as enemies rather than our brothers and sisters in terrible need. We must disrupt those who train us to see Muslim men, women and children as forces of fear rather than as children of God,\" McElroy said at the time, according to Catholic News Agency.",
      "McElroy's criticism of Trump continued. In a statement released by the Diocese of San Diego reacting to a 2018 Trump border visit, McElroy said, \"It is a sad day for our country when we trade the majestic, hope-filled symbolism of the Statue of Liberty for an ineffective and grotesque wall which both displays and inflames the ethnic and cultural divisions that have long been the underside of our national history,\" according to Millennial Journal.",
      "McElroy has been one of a minority of U.S. bishops harshly criticizing the campaign to exclude Catholic politicians who support abortion from Communion, a campaign Francis has publicly criticized by insisting that bishops must be pastors, not politicians.",
      "He has also questioned why the U.S. bishops\u2019 conference, which has leaned conservative in its leadership, consistently insists on identifying abortion as its \"preeminent\" priority. He has questioned why greater prominence was not given to issues such as racism, poverty, immigration and climate change. He has also expressed support for LGBTQ youth and denounced the bullying often directed at them, further aligning himself with Francis\u2019 priorities as pope.",

      "Several plans for Gaza\u2019s future have been proposed, with differing visions for how Israel should proceed.",
      "Retired Major General Giora Eiland, former head of Israel's National Security Council, has advocated for a more militaristic approach. His \"general plan\" calls for the evacuation of northern Gaza\u2019s population, followed by the encirclement and siege of Gaza\u2019s northern region. By cutting off supplies like water, fuel and food, Eiland believes Hamas will be forced to submit, and the hostages could be freed.",
      "In the long term, Eiland envisions an Israel that controls parts of Gaza but only militarily- with no Israeli citizens entering and no settlements on the ground. Eiland told Fox News Digital, \"If we have control over the northern part of Gaza and Hamas is no longer in power, then we can start the process of rebuilding Gaza with international cooperation.\"",
      "While the approach could weaken Hamas, critics warn it might exacerbate Gaza\u2019s dire humanitarian crisis. One senior security official told Fox News Digital, \"If we carry on like this, we risk an endless cycle of violence. It\u2019s crucial to have a strategic endgame that involves dismantling Hamas but also considering international law.\"",

      "Eiland argues that his strategy aligns with international law and could force Hamas into negotiations. \"When I prepared this plan, I read the manual that is published by the American Department of Defense. Twelve hundred pages of explanation of what American doctrine is in regard to the implementation of international humanitarian law. And according to this manual, all that I propose so far is written explicitly in this manual,\" Eiland added, \"Hamas cares only about two things: humiliation and losing land. If we can make them lose control over land, they will be under real pressure.\"",
      "In contrast, Major General (res.) Amos Yadlin is supportive of a diplomatic solution. \"We proposed a mechanism of Palestinian technocrats who have ties to the Palestinian Authority symbolically, but not practically. These technocrats would be mentored by Arab groups such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Morocco.\"",
      "PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT ABBAS SAYS US IS THE 'ONLY POWER' CAPABLE OF ORDERING ISRAEL TO END THE WAR",
      "Yadlin, who is the CEO of the Israeli think tank\u00a0Mind Israel, envisions Gaza\u2019s future being shaped by Arab states. He said they have the necessary influence to stabilize Gaza, after Israel dismantled\u00a0Hamas military infrastructure. \"No one will rebuild Gaza while Hamas remains in control,\" Yadlin told Fox News Digital. \"Hamas can be a political party, based on acceptance of the Quartet conditions from 2017: acknowledging Israel and condemning terror,\" he said.",
      "The IDF said that it finished its operation in the Bani Suheila area of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, destroying infrastructure used by Hamas.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces)",
      "One issue that Yadlin is more pragmatic about, and which is a red line for the current Israeli government, is the role of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Gaza. Israeli officials have made it clear that the PA will not be involved in the post-Hamas governance of Gaza. \"No scenario includes the Palestinian Authority,\" one official said. \"We see its inability in the West Bank and do not want to bring that capability to Gaza.\"",
      "This exclusion of the PA raises questions about Gaza\u2019s future governance and the potential for political stability. While Israel favors a technocratic approach, it remains uncertain whether such a model can function without the involvement of the Palestinian Authority.",

The UAE\u2019s willingness to engage in humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts has drawn attention, particularly as the region looks for alternatives to Hamas. \"The UAE is the most relevant player in Gaza\u2019s future,\" one Israeli security official said. \"They have the resources and the desire to contribute, but we are only talking about the civil aspects.\"",

    "summary": "Two federal prisoners who are among 37 inmates whose death sentences were commuted last month by Biden say they are refusing to accept his clemency action",
    "story": [
      "Two prisoners who are among the 37 federal inmates whose death sentences were commuted last month by President Joe Biden \u2014 a move that spares them from the death chamber \u2014 have taken an unusual stance: They're refusing to sign paperwork accepting his clemency action.",
      "Shannon Agofsky and Len Davis, both inmates at the\u00a0U.S. Penitentiary in\u00a0Terre Haute, Indiana, filed emergency motions in federal court in the state's southern district on Dec. 30 seeking an injunction to block having their death sentences commuted to life in prison without parole.",
      "The men believe that having their sentences commuted would put them at a legal disadvantage as they seek to appeal their cases based on claims of innocence.",
      "The courts look at death penalty appeals very closely in a legal process known as heightened scrutiny, in which courts should examine death penalty cases for errors because of the life and death consequences of the sentence. The process doesn't necessarily lead to a greater likelihood of success, but Agofsky suggested he doesn\u2019t want to lose that additional scrutiny.",
      "\"To commute his sentence now, while the defendant has active litigation in court, is to strip him of the protection of heightened scrutiny. This constitutes an undue burden, and leaves the defendant in a position of fundamental unfairness, which would decimate his pending appellate procedures,\u201d according to Agofsky's filing.",
      "Davis wrote in his filing that he \"has always maintained that having a death sentence would draw attention to the overwhelming misconduct\" he alleges against the Justice Department.",
      "He also wrote that he \"thanks court for its prompt attention to this fast-moving constitutional conundrum. The case law on this issue is quite murky.\"",
      "But inmates face a daunting challenge in having their death sentences restored, said Dan Kobil, a professor of constitutional law at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, who has represented defendants in death penalty and clemency cases.",
      "A 1927 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, for example, maintains that a president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons, and \"the convict's consent is not required.\"",
      "There are instances of prisoners who have refused a commutation because they would rather be executed, Kobil said, but just like \"we impose sentences for the public welfare, the president and governors in states commute sentences for the public welfare.\"",
      "Robin Maher, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, added that the vast majority of inmates on federal death row were grateful for Biden's decision, \"which is constitutionally authorized and absolute.\"",
      "The Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.",
      "Agofsky was convicted in the 1989 murder of an Oklahoma bank president, Dan Short, whose body was found in a lake. Federal prosecutors said Agofsky and his brother, Joseph Agofsky, abducted and killed Short before stealing $71,000 from his bank.",
      "A jury declined to convict Joseph Agofsky of murder, but he received a life sentence for the robbery, while Shannon Agofsky received a life sentence on murder and robbery charges. Joseph Agofsky died in prison in 2013.",
      "Shannon Agofsky, while incarcerated in a Texas prison, was convicted in the 2001 stomping death of a fellow inmate, Luther Plant, and a jury recommended a death sentence in 2004.",
      "In his filing seeking an injunction for Biden's commutation, Agofsky, 53, said that he is disputing how he was charged with murder in the stomping death and that he is also trying to \"establish his innocence in the original case for which he was incarcerated.\"",
      "\"The defendant never requested commutation. The defendant never filed for commutation,\" the filing says. \"The defendant does not want commutation, and refused to sign the papers offered with the commutation.\"",
      "Agofsky's wife, Laura, who married him in 2019 in a ceremony over the phone, said Monday that his lawyers had urged him to request a presidential commutation in his case, but he refused because his status as a death row inmate afforded him legal counsel that is critical in his appeals.",
      "However, Laura Agofsky said her husband still has lawyers who are helping him. Solely having his sentence commuted is \"not a win for him,\" she said, because she believes there is evidence that can prove his innocence.",
      "\"He doesn't want to die in prison being labeled a cold-blooded killer,\" Laura Agofsky said in a phone interview.",
      "Davis, a former New Orleans police officer, was convicted in the 1994 murder of Kim Groves, who had filed a complaint against him accusing him of beating a teenager in her Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood. Prosecutors said Davis hired a drug dealer to kill Groves and charged the officer with violating Groves' civil rights. Davis' original death sentence was thrown out by a federal appeals court but reinstated in 2005.",
      "The case was part of a sprawling federal investigation into corruption within the New Orleans police force.",
      "Davis, 60, \"has always maintained his innocence and argued that federal court had no jurisdiction to try him for civil rights offenses,\" his filing says.",
      "Both Davis and Agofsky are asking a judge to appoint a co-counsel in their requests for an injunction of the commutations.",
      "Maher, of the Death Penalty Information Center, said all people accused of federal crimes have a constitutional right to counsel for trial, as well as a statutory right in appeals if they are convicted, regardless of whether they are death row cases.",
      "\"Death sentences are the most extreme sanction that can be given in a criminal case, and they deserve the highest quality legal representation and judicial scrutiny,\" Maher said.",
      "Biden's decision to commute the sentences of 37 of the 40 federal death row prisoners, all men, came after weeks of speculation. He was praised by a coalition of human rights and anti-death penalty groups that have expressed opposition to President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to expand federal executions in his second term.",
      "The Justice Department under Biden imposed a moratorium on executions.",
      "\"I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level,\" Biden said in a statement announcing the commutation. \"In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\"",
      "Biden, however, declined to grant commutations to three federal death row prisoners who were involved in either mass killings or terrorist attacks.",
      "Still, the president has faced criticism for commuting the sentences of the 37 others.",
      "The Office of the Independent Police Monitor in New Orleans, a civilian police oversight agency created in 2009, said commuting Davis' death sentence is \"a painful reminder that justice is not always served as it should be.\"",
      "\"In this action, President Biden showed more mercy for Davis than this corrupt officer ever showed for Kim Groves, her children and family, and the people of New Orleans,\" the office said in a statement.",
      "Laura Agofsky, a German citizen who first connected with her husband as pen pals and has yet to meet him in person, said she realizes that reversing the commutation is an uphill battle, but he remains focused on appealing his case.",
      "\"We've been talking about the possibility of a commutation ever since Biden was elected, given his past statements about the death penalty,\" said Laura Agofsky, who has become an advocate for her husband and works with the German\u00a0Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. (Germany does not have capital punishment.)",
      "While Biden's announcement was \"a very black day for us,\" she added, \"now, with the knowledge he will keep his lawyers, we know they will fight for him.\""

Instead, the event transpired in the way it was meant to unfold, pro forma, taking only 30 minutes.",

That allows them to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, where Republicans have 53 seats \u2014 and after Jan. 20, a tiebreaking vote from incoming Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and can cut Democrats out of the process.",
      "One bill or two?",
      "Key senators, including Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have been pushing to break it up into two bills \u2014 allowing Republicans to score a quick victory on border funding and take some time to craft a second tax bill.",
      "But Johnson and Trump say they prefer a single package.",
      "\u201cThe plan in the House has been one bill. We met for two days over the weekend \u2014 two full days of discussion and strategizing with that in mind. And so that\u2019s our assumption right now,\u201d Johnson told reporters Monday. \u201cThe Senate has a little different opinion and perspective on reconciliation and what the wisest strategy is than the House. And that\u2019s OK; that\u2019s part of this process.",
      "\u201cWe are going to get this mission accomplished,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told NBC News that renewing Trump\u2019s tax cuts, trillions of dollars of which expire at the end of this year, is the more difficult ask.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do the tax aspect in the first bill, we\u2019re going to have to really saddle up and ride. Because that\u2019s going to be, obviously, the most complicated part,\u201d Kennedy said Monday before Congress certified Trump\u2019s election win. \u201cIronically, the immigration part, the border security, is probably going to be the easiest thing that we\u2019ll tackle.\u201d",
      "To appease lawmakers and Trump allies who want to deal with the border immediately, House and Senate Republicans will bring a series of immigration and border security bills up for votes in the coming weeks, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got six months to a year to demonstrate to the American people that we\u2019re going to bring change,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cNow, whether you do it in one bill or two bills, frankly, I can teach that round or flat. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chair of the Budget Committee, which will oversee the Senate process, warned against a one-bill strategy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d he said Sunday on Fox News. \u201cIf we don\u2019t put border first and get it done, it\u2019s going to be a nightmare for our national security. ... If you hold border security hostage to get tax cuts, you\u2019re playing Russian roulette with our national security.\u201d",
      "Thune also weighed in Monday, saying Republicans are \u201cworking through\u201d how to proceed when he was asked about one versus two bills.",
      "\u201cThe process issues here are a lot less important than the results,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "House Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., said Trump\u2019s preference for a single bill means the debate is settled.",
      "\u201cThe House is doing one bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been decided.\u201d",
      "Limitations on the bill",
      "The 50-vote reconciliation process means the package must follow strict rules and be limited to matters involving taxes and spending. Under what\u2019s called the \u201cByrd Rule\u201d (named for late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.), senators from either party can challenge parts of a reconciliation bill that don\u2019t meet those criteria. The Senate parliamentarian must rule whether those provisions are really about taxes and spending or not \u2014 and if not, they\u2019re stripped out.",
      "The only way to avoid that is to overrule the parliamentarian, which even some hard-line rank-and-file Republicans are already saying they prefer not to do.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty committed to preserving the filibuster, and that\u2019s kind of like blowing up the filibuster,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a Trump ally, said last month, adding that Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t need to change policy\u201d to achieve their goals on the border.",
      "A serious complication is Johnson\u2019s call to use the party-line bill to lift the debt ceiling, which Congress will need to do this year to prevent an economically calamitous default on U.S. obligations. It\u2019s an issue many Republicans hate to deal with, usually requiring Democratic votes, and Johnson\u2019s majority includes plenty of members who have never voted to raise the country\u2019s borrowing limit.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what amount he\u2019s talking about or what time frame, but if you\u2019re going to increase the debt ceiling, you need real cuts. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in an interview Monday.",
      "\u201cWe suck at cutting. If we could cut 12 cents I\u2019d freaking throw a God-darn parade,\u201d he said, before making clear he was joking about the latter.",
      "Roy declined to identify a dollar amount. \u201cWe need meaningful, significant cuts. I wouldn\u2019t want to pre-negotiate that,\u201d he said, making it clear that \u201cwe need to decrease deficits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole point of reconciliation is to get to deficit neutrality,\u201d he added.",
      "That will be very difficult to achieve in a bill that would be likely to add trillions of dollars to the long-term debt by extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts before they expire at the end of this year. Trump is also calling on Congress to attach his \u201cno tax on tips\u201d proposal, which is projected to increase the cost of the package.",
      "There are other potential nuisances that Republicans may encounter. A massive package goes against perennial GOP demands to legislate in smaller, single-subject bills. And an undertaking of such magnitude would have to be negotiated by party leaders, which frequently raises hackles among conservatives who say legislation should be developed from the bottom up at the committee level.",
      "In a Truth Social post Sunday night, Trump called for Congress to advance his agenda in \u201cone powerful Bill.\u201d But on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show Monday, he kept the door ajar to the two-bill strategy, saying he sees the advantages of it.",
      "\u201cI favor one bill. I also want to get everything passed. And you know, there are some people that don\u2019t necessarily agree with it. So I\u2019m open to that, also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy preference is one big, as I say, one big, beautiful bill. Now, to do that takes longer. You know, to submit it takes longer, actually. But, so it\u2019s a longer process. I would say I\u2019d live with that. ... To me, it just is a cleaner, it\u2019s cleaner. It\u2019s nicer. Now, with that being said, we\u2019d get some border work done a little bit earlier, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d",
      "Kennedy said Trump and Republicans need to make that decision quickly and get to work.",
      "\u201cI just want to know what the president thinks. I just want to have an agreement. Again, I\u2019m not wedded to either one bill or two bills,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think we need to all get in the same room and say, OK, here\u2019s our game plan. And some will be happy, some will be sad. Because there\u2019s some people that feel strongly in the Senate that we ought to split them up. But I understand the House\u2019s position, too. We can probably clear a lot of that up with the president with a phone call.\u201d"

      "A federal judge in New York has found former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court for not complying with orders to turn over information about his assets to a pair of former Georgia election workers he defamed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman made the contempt finding Monday afternoon after Giuliani testified over two days to answer questions about why he\u2019d failed to hand over assets and court-ordered discovery information to help satisfy Ruby Freeman and Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss\u2019\u00a0$146 million defamation judgment\u00a0against him.",
      "Giuliani, the former New York mayor and U.S. attorney, \"willfully violated an unambiguous order of the court\" by failing to provide information when he was supposed to, Liman said.",
      "\"The defendant has attempted to run the clock by stalling,\" he said.",
      "\"Discovery is not supposed to be a shell game where the hidden ball is moved around and around,\" he added.",
      "He said he'd rule on \"appropriate sanctions\" against Giuliani later.",
      "Giuliani testified remotely earlier in the day from his Florida home, telling his lawyer Joseph Cammarata that he had tried to comply with court orders in the case and blaming earlier failures to do so on his previous attorney. He also complained that he has had difficulty juggling his various court cases, including two criminal cases and two other defamation suits related to his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "\"Some days it is completely impossible because there are conflicting demands for material and appearances on the same day,\" Giuliani said.",
      "He also said he had found some key documents that Freeman and Moss had been waiting for \u2014 the proprietary lease for his multimillion-dollar Manhattan apartment and the title for his Mercedes-Benz convertible.",
      "Both documents, however, include his divorced wife on the titles and need to be amended before Freeman and Moss' attorneys can use them.",
      "Freeman and Moss had asked the judge to find Giuliani in civil contempt for failing to turn over information and to surrender numerous valuable assets \u2014 including a New York Yankees jersey autographed by Hall of Fame outfielder Joe DiMaggio \u2014 to pay down the $146 million judgment.",
      "The pair were awarded the sum in their defamation lawsuit against Giuliani, who they said had spread falsities about Trump\u2019s election loss in 2020 resulting in an onslaught of racist and violent threats against them.",
      "Their attorneys had urged Liman in a court filing to apply \u201cappropriate sanctions\u201d to prompt Giuliani\u2019s compliance with court orders after he repeatedly ran afoul of deadlines to turn over assets and financial data.",
      "Giuliani said Friday that the DiMaggio jersey was \u201cmissing\u201d and denied an assertion made by a friend, Monsignor Alan Placa, that he had seen it framed in Giuliani\u2019s property in Palm Beach, Florida, within the past two years.",
      "On Monday, Giuliani said he's still searching for the jersey. \"I don't know where it is, and it is hard to re-create who took it, and I am personally conducting my own investigation about this,\" he said.",
      "Testifying in court Friday, Giuliani denied having withheld other Yankees memorabilia, saying he wasn\u2019t \u201chiding\u201d a signed image of Reggie Jackson, another Hall of Famer, that the election workers\u2019 attorney said was listed as an asset in a bankruptcy document.",
      "Lawyers for Freeman and Moss have argued that Giuliani had demonstrated \u201ca consistent pattern of willful defiance of the Court\u2019s Turnover Orders,\u201d and they cited his failure to surrender the proprietary lease and co-op shares to the estimated $6 million Manhattan apartment, cash in his bank account and the title document for his Mercedes, which used to belong to Hollywood icon Lauren Bacall.",
      "Ted Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani, said in a statement, \u201cIt's tragic to watch as our justice system has been turned into a total mockery, where we have charades instead of actual hearings and trials.\u201d",
      "A trial will be held in the New York case on Jan. 16, to determine the status of Giuliani's Florida condo and possession of his Yankees World Series rings, which he says he gifted to his son years ago.",
      "Giuliani\u00a0is also facing\u00a0a second contempt proceeding in Washington, D.C., this week over whether he\u00a0should face sanctions\u00a0for continuing to defame Freeman and Moss on his\u00a0livestreamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor Live\u201d show\u00a0in defiance of a court-ordered agreement."

      "Hospital officials said they could not comment because of patient privacy laws.",
      "James H. Davis III, the lawyer Shannon Amos retained to investigate her father\u2019s death, said in an undated news release received by NBC News on Dec. 24 that the \u201cfamily deserves to know the full circumstances surrounding Mr. Amos\u2019 care and the events that led to his passing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are committed to pursuing all available avenues to ensure that these questions are answered,\u201d Davis said in the statement.",
      "Davis\u2019 hiring is the latest development in an ongoing dispute between John Amos\u2019 two children. Shannon Amos said that while K.C. Amos and Foster are in frequent contact with each other, neither speak with her because of the rift.",
      "According to Shannon Amos, the split between her and her brother began with differences over their mother\u2019s care and the handling of her estate. Their mother, Noel Mickelson, died in 2016 from sepsis caused by bed sores, and a malignant tumor, according to Shannon Amos.",
      "Though the siblings had reconciled after their mother\u2019s death, Shannon Amos said, K.C. Amos' struggles with \u201caddiction and financial mismanagement\u201d led to a \u201cmutual parting\u201d in August 2020, after which he moved in with their father.",
      "\u201cIt became increasingly difficult for family, friends, business associates and caregivers to contact my father,\u201d Shannon Amos said.",

      "The Colorado Bureau of Investigation and the Custer County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Colorado opened an investigation on June 9, 2023, into allegations that John Amos was being subjected to elder abuse, according to a news release from the sheriff\u2019s office. John Amos had been living in Westcliffe, Colorado, at the time.",
      "\u201cWe did conduct a criminal investigation. We did collect and analyze some evidence,\u201d Custer County Sheriff Lloyd Smith said. \u201cIn the end, the district attorney did not believe there was enough evidence to file charges.\u201d",
      "In a video K.C. Amos posted on Instagram on June 15, 2023, John Amos said that he had \u201congoing issues\u201d with his daughter and that he believed she was taking advantage of him.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s the one that I would attribute my elderly abuse to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a case of elderly abuse.\u201d",

Kevin Faler, a private investigator hired by John Amos, characterized it in a Dec. 24 interview with NBC News as \u201cfinancial elder abuse,\u201d but he provided no further details. Shannon Amos said that when Goudy asked John Amos about the allegation against Shannon Amos, he said, \u201cI have no recollection of that.\u201d",
      "Shannon Amos said her father was in a \u201cvulnerable state\u201d because the video was recorded while he was in the hospital with congestive heart failure and was on pain medication and suffering from dementia, which she said made him \u201csusceptible to K.C.\u2019s manipulation.\u201d Shannon Amos was not able to provide documentation of a diagnosis of dementia.",
      "Foster disputed that John Amos had been diagnosed with dementia.",
      "\u201cJohn Amos had his right mind,\u201d Foster said last month, adding that her client spent his final months working on projects and writing scripts.",

      "The criminal complaint states that Shannon was in \u201cimminent fear of death\u201d and believed \u201dthe immediacy of the threat and the likelihood it could be carried out, specifically by sending text messages with photos of firearms.\u201d",

    "summary": "The U.S. has recorded its first human death from bird flu, in a patient hospitalized in Louisiana. The case was considered the country\u2019s first severe human H5N1 infection.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has recorded its first human death from bird flu, a grim milestone that comes as at least 67 cases have been recorded in the country.",
      "The patient, who was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions, was hospitalized in Louisiana in December; the case was considered the country\u2019s\u00a0first severe human H5N1 infection.",
      "The Louisiana Department of Health said the patient had been exposed to a combination of a backyard flock and wild birds.",
      "\u201cThe Department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient\u2019s family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cDue to patient confidentiality and respect for the family, this will be the final update about the patient.\u201d",
      "All but one of the human bird flu infections confirmed so far in the U.S. were diagnosed in the last 10 months, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most cases have been relatively mild, with symptoms including pinkeye, coughs or sneezes.",
      "The majority of the patients became sick after exposure to infected cattle or poultry. The Louisiana patient was the first case linked to exposure to a backyard flock.",
      "Just two cases have involved patients who did not have known exposure to animals. One was a person in Missouri who was hospitalized with bird flu in September but recovered after being treated with antiviral medications. The other was a child in California who experienced mild symptoms in November.",
      "The CDC maintains that the immediate risk to public health is low. Public health officials have not found any evidence that the virus has spread person-to-person, which would mark a dire step in bird flu's evolution.",
      "\u201cWhile tragic, a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death,\u201d the agency said in a statement on Monday.",
      "\u201cThere are no concerning virologic changes actively spreading in wild birds, poultry, or cows that would raise the risk to human health,\u201d the statement added.",
      "However, samples of the virus collected from the Louisiana patient showed signs of mutations\u00a0that could make it more transmissible to humans, according to the agency.",
      "The strain of bird flu behind the ongoing outbreak began spreading globally among wild birds and poultry in 2020. Since it took root in the U.S. in 2022, more than 130 million birds have been infected or culled. The virus has also spread to dairy cows and other mammals. More than 900 bird flu cases have been detected in cattle since March.",
      "Rising transmission among animals increases the odds that humans could be exposed and that the virus could mutate in ways that could lead to a pandemic. Bird flu appears to spread efficiently on dairy farms, likely because cows shed the virus through their mammary glands, then infect other animals through their raw milk. The virus has also turned up in wastewater in several states, including in sites without dairy or poultry facilities.",
      "For people concerned about bird flu risk, the CDC advises against drinking unpasteurized raw milk and suggests avoiding contact with sick or dead animals. Workers on poultry or dairy farms affected by H5N1 should wear\u00a0personal protective equipment and monitor for symptoms.",
      "The federal response to bird flu ramped up a month ago, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture ordered testing of the national milk supply, starting in six states. The Biden administration also set aside $306 million last week for additional surveillance, laboratory testing and medical research for bird flu.",
      "But some experts have criticized the U.S.'s response for being too slow or limited.",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration has been mishandling the outbreak in cattle for months, increasing the possibility of a dangerous, wider spread,\u201d two former Food and Drug Administration\u00a0officials wrote in an editorial in The Washington Post on Friday."

    "story": [
      "A new report once again raises the question of whether there is a link between fluoride in drinking water and lower IQ levels in children.",
      "The research, published in JAMA Pediatrics on Monday, is a review of 74 other studies exploring how the mineral may affect children\u2019s IQ levels.",
      "The analysis found a statistically significant association\u00a0between higher fluoride exposure and lower children\u2019s IQ scores. It showed that \"the more fluoride a child is exposed to, the more likely that child\u2019s IQ will be lower than if they were not exposed,\u201d Kyla Taylor, author of the study and a health scientist at the National Institute of Environmental Health Studies at the National Institutes of Health, wrote in an email. Taylor was not available for an interview.",
      "For every small increase of fluoride found in kids' urine, Taylor wrote, \u201cthere is a decrease of 1.63 IQ points in children.\u201d",
      "The researchers did not suggest that fluoride should be removed from drinking water. According to the study authors, most of the 74 studies they reviewed were low-quality ones. All were done in countries other than the United States, such as China, where researchers analyzed fluoride levels in water and in urine. Fluoride levels in China and other countries tend to be much higher than in the U.S., the researchers noted.",
      "Fluoride has been added to public water supplies in the U.S. for decades. No studies in the U.S. have flagged any measurable decreases in children's cognitive development since fluoride was introduced.",
      "There has been a growing pushback against fluoridated water in a number of communities across the country.",
      "Some have already voted to remove fluoride from public water supplies.",
      "Dentists worry the findings will be potentially damaging to public health.",
      "\"What we have seen in areas where fluoride has been removed, is that dental decay rates have increased dramatically,\" said Dr. Erica Caffrey, a pediatric dentist and chair of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry\u2019s Council on Clinical Affairs.",
      "Major public health groups, including the\u00a0CDC, the\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0and the American Dental Association, support the use of fluoridated water.",
      "An ADA spokesperson, Dr. Scott Tomar, said that if more robust studies prove a link between fluoride and brain development, public health leaders should take a closer look at the mineral's effects. That proof doesn't exist yet, he said.",
      "\"With the evidence that we have so far, that is not at all a clear case at this point, certainly not at the levels of fluoride that we use in community water fluoridation,\" said Tomar, also a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago College of Dentistry.",
      "He pointed to an Australian study published in December that found no link between early childhood exposure to fluoride and negative cognitive neurodevelopment. Researchers at the University of Queensland recruited young kids beginning in 2012 and then followed up a decade later, when they were teenagers.",
      "That study found a slightly higher IQ in kids who consistently drank fluoridated water. The levels in Queensland are consistent with U.S. recommendations.",
      "Despite fluoride's proven benefits in preventing tooth decay, some experts say any possible link to neurotoxicity in kids should be studied further.",
      "\"At a minimum, we need urgently to have an independent scientific panel come together to review the evidence,\" said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada. Lanphear wrote an editorial in support of the new research.",
      "The U.S. Public Health Service recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L of drinking water.\u00a0NIH\u2019s Taylor said there was not enough data to determine whether that level has any impact on children\u2019s IQs in the U.S.",
      "Steven Levy, a professor of preventive and community dentistry at the University of Iowa, wrote a second editorial that opposed the new report.",
      "\u201cThe evidence base is very weak for there being any concerns at these low levels,\u201d he said. \"The ongoing benefits of community water fluoridation at this time strongly outweigh the flawed analyzes that are presented in this paper.\"",
      "A federal judge in California ruled\u00a0in September that even though he couldn\u2019t conclude with certainty that fluoridated water was a danger to public health, the Environmental Protection Agency should strengthen water fluoridation regulations.",
      "Dr. Courtney Peterson, a pediatric dentist in private practice in Buffalo, New York, is concerned about the movement against the fluoride.",
      "\u201cI think people are going to freak out,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are going to look at the headline and say high levels of fluoride will lead to a whole bunch (of problems) without actually looking into it.\"",
      "Still, the battle over fluoride is likely to strengthen under President-elect Donald Trump's next term. His pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., previously said without credible evidence that fluoride is \"an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss,\" and other problems. Kennedy later told NBC News that \"fluoride is on the way out.\"",
      "A major sticking point in the debate of fluoride is that there's never been a double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial to examine how fluoride might affect children.",
      "Researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, however, have begun a study of families with babies under 6 months old who use either fluoridated or nonfluoridated bottled water in their formula and drinking water. The plan is to follow the children for four years."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 18:07:45 GMT",
    "summary": "A new study in the journal JAMA Pediatrics found that less than 0.1% of adolescents in the U.S. were prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.",
    "story": [
      "As policymakers around the world debate whether minors should have access to transition-related medications, a study published Monday in the nation\u2019s premier pediatric medical journal found that the drugs are rarely prescribed to youths.",
      "Less than 0.1% of adolescents with private insurance in the United States are transgender or gender-diverse and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones, according to the findings published in JAMA Pediatrics.",
      "The research note, which analyzed the private insurance claims for more than 5.1 million young patients ages 8 to 17 from 2018 to 2022, also found that no transgender patients under 12 were prescribed gender-affirming hormones. Private insurers covered 65% of the country as of 2023, per the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important for the public to understand that not everyone is getting access to gender-affirming care when they go to the doctor,\u201d said the report\u2019s lead author, Landon Hughes, a fellow at Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s not as ubiquitous as some may want us to believe, especially among youth.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not some massive wave of folks accessing care,\u201d Hughes added. \u201cIt is certainly a minuscule group of people who are getting access to this care, and it\u2019s certainly eaten up a lot of the public discourse in the recent political, legal climate.\u201d",
      "The study found that the use of puberty blockers and hormones was more common among trans minors who were assigned female sex at birth versus those assigned male at birth. The authors noted that this may occur because the onset of puberty happens sooner for people assigned female at birth.",
      "Puberty blockers are used to delay the onset of puberty or pause it as it is transpiring. The medication is designed to give children who are experiencing gender dysphoria more time to decide if they want to take more permanent steps to transition genders. Puberty resumes when the medication is no longer taken. Gender-affirming hormones are typically prescribed to replace hormones that a person\u2019s body naturally makes, but that do not align with their gender identity.",
      "Most major medical organizations in the United States support gender-affirming care for minors. The American Medical Association, which publishes JAMA, has referred to the care as \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d",
      "Dr. Alex S. Keuroghlian, who is the director of education and training at the LGBTQ health care organization Fenway Health and is not affiliated with the study, said he is \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the findings, because access to transition-related care is limited.",
      "\u201cThis particular type of care, there is such a bias against providing, that I would suspect not every transgender or gender-diverse youth who would have benefited from it in this dataset necessarily received it,\u201d he said. \u201cI see that in practice in the communities that we work with, even in privileged communities with private insurance. There could be a lot of barriers at the family level, at the practice level to that kid getting gender-affirming care.\u201d",
      "In December, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case involving state bans on puberty-suppressing medication and other forms of transition-related care for minors. The court is weighing the constitutionality of a state law in Tennessee that prohibits gender-affirming care for minors, and the justices appeared to lean toward upholding the law. Tennessee is one of more than two dozen states that restrict such care in the United States.",
      "Last month, the United Kingdom indefinitely banned new prescriptions of puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria. The indefinite ban came several months after an independent study commissioned by England\u2019s National Health Service concluded medical evidence around transition-related care for minors was \u201cremarkably weak.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration on Monday set maximum levels for lead in baby foods like jarred fruits and vegetables, yogurts and dry cereal, part of an effort to cut young kids\u2019 exposure to\u00a0the toxic metal\u00a0that causes developmental and neurological problems.",
      "The agency issued final guidance that it estimated could reduce lead exposure from processed baby foods by 20% to 30%. The limits are voluntary, not mandatory, for food manufacturers, but they allow the FDA to take enforcement action if foods exceed the levels.",
      "It\u2019s part of the FDA\u2019s ongoing effort to \u201creduce dietary exposure to contaminants, including lead, in foods to as low as possible over time, while maintaining access to nutritious foods,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Consumer advocates, who have long sought limits on lead in children\u2019s foods, welcomed the guidance first proposed two years ago, but said it didn\u2019t go far enough.",
      "\u201cFDA\u2019s actions today are a step forward and will help protect children,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cHowever, the agency took too long to act and ignored important public input that could have strengthened these standards.\u201d",
      "The new limits on lead for children younger than 2 don\u2019t cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, which some research has shown contain higher levels of lead. And they don\u2019t limit other metals such as cadmium that have been detected in baby foods.",
      "Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, called the limits \u201cvirtually meaningless because they\u2019re based more on industry feasibility and not on what would best protect public health.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for baby food maker Gerber said the company\u2019s products meet the limits.",
      "There\u2019s no safe level of lead exposure for children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The metal causes \u201cwell-documented health effects,\u201d including brain and nervous system damage and slowed growth and development. However, lead occurs naturally in some foods and comes from pollutants in air, water and soil, which can make it impossible to eliminate entirely.",
      "The FDA guidance sets a lead limit of 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals. The guidance covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes.",
      "The new guidance comes more than a year after\u00a0lead-tainted pouches of apple cinnamon puree\u00a0sickened more than 560 children in the U.S. between October 2023 and April 2024, according to the CDC.",
      "The levels of lead detected in those products were more than 2,000 times higher than the FDA\u2019s maximum. Officials stressed that the agency doesn\u2019t need guidance to take action on foods that violate the law."

      "President-elect Donald Trump and his former co-defendants in the Florida classified documents case launched an effort Monday to block the release of a final report by special counsel Jack Smith that also addresses the election interference case.",
      "Both cases against Trump have been dismissed.",
      "Lawyers for defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira filed a motion Monday night asking U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to block Smith, who prosecuted the case, from issuing his report. They cited the judge's previous ruling that Smith\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cThe Final Report promises to be a one-sided, slanted report, relying nearly exclusively on evidence presented to a grand jury and subject to all requisite protections\u2014and which is known to Smith only as a result of his unconstitutional appointment\u2014in order to serve a singular purpose: convincing the public that everyone Smith charged is guilty of the crimes charged,\u201d the four lawyers wrote.",
      "Defense lawyers asked Cannon on Monday to hold a hearing and rule on their motion by Friday, saying they believe the release of the report is \u201cimminent.\u201d",

If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump\u2019s incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\u201d they wrote.",

      "Smith appealed the dismissal, but the case was upended by Trump\u2019s election in November, because of the Justice Department\u2019s long-standing policy not to prosecute sitting presidents. An appeals court later agreed to dismiss the case against Trump at Smith\u2019s request.",
      "Smith was also forced to wind down the election interference case against Trump after\u00a0indicting him\u00a0in 2023 in connection with his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. A judge in November agreed to dismiss that case, too, at Smith\u2019s request.",

    "story": [
      "Six college students in Massachusetts were accused of luring an active-duty service member whom they falsely described as a sexual predator to their campus, where a group of more than two dozen people chased and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "One of the students who was charged told police that the plot was modeled on \u201cTo Catch a Predator,\u201d NBC\u2019s discontinued program that, during its three seasons, aimed to catch adults seeking to prey on minors using undercover cameras and decoys impersonating underage dates, according to a statement of facts in the case.",
      "\u201cCatch a predator is a big thing on TikTok currently,\u201d the facts document cites the student, Easton Randall, 19, as saying.",
      "Eleven Illinois teens were charged last month in a similar incident that authorities in Mount Prospect, northwest of Chicago, attributed to a \u201cviral social media trend.\u201d",
      "In a statement at the time, the city\u2019s police department did not provide additional details about the trend. Police Chief Michael Eterno pleaded with parents \u201cto take these incidents as an opportunity to talk with their teenage children about the seriousness of actively participating in these types of trends they see on social media.\u201d",
      "At Assumption University, the private Catholic university in Worcester where the six people charged in the plot are students, there was \u201cabsolutely\u201d no evidence that the man students accused of being a predator had been seeking sex with a minor, the statement says.",
      "Still, he was chased by what the statement describes as a \u201cmob\u201d of 25 to 30 people \u2014 some of them recording the pursuit \u2014 and ensnared in a conspiracy carried out by a group of six that includes allegations of \u201csystemic mistreatment, false imprisonment, physical assault and battery and potential character assassination,\u201d according to the university police sergeant who wrote the statement.",
      "Charged with kidnapping, conspiracy",
      "The statement identifies one of the students as a juvenile, whose charges are not included in a criminal complaint filed last month. The five other students, including Randall, were charged with kidnapping and conspiracy, the complaint shows.",
      "Two other students were accused of additional crimes. Kelsy Brainard, 18, was charged with intimidation. Kevin Carroll, 18, was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.",
      "Messages left with lawyers for Carroll and a second defendant were not returned. A relative of Randall\u2019s would not comment. A message left for another defendant on a phone number listed as that of a relative was not returned, nor was a message sent via Facebook to a profile with Brainard\u2019s name.",
      "In a statement, Assumption University President Greg Weiner said the behavior described in the court filing is \u201cabhorrent and antithetical to Assumption University\u2019s mission and values. In all circumstances, we expect our students to exercise sound judgment and uphold the principles of respect, responsibility, and character that define our community.\u201d",
      "Once the incident was reported, Weiner said, the school\u2019s Public Safety Department investigated the allegations and pursued criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThis situation is particularly sobering because the victim is an active-duty military service member,\u201d he said. \u201cHis service reminds us of the sacrifices made by those who defend our freedoms, including the opportunity to pursue a college education.\u201d",
      "Reached by phone, the victim\u2019s father told NBC News that his son is 22. He declined to identify which branch of the military his son serves in and said it appears that authorities are doing their job.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing their due diligence, and these kids seem to have hung themselves with their own words,\u201d he said.",
      "Home to attend a funeral",
      "According to the statement of facts, the incident on Oct. 1 was initially reported to university officials the next day, when Brainard said a \u201ccreepy\u201d Tinder app contact had come to campus looking to meet a 17-year-old girl. She texted a friend \u2014 Randall \u2014 who chased the person away, according to the statement.",
      "In a subsequent interview with campus police, Brainard reiterated this claim, saying she had been the victim of unsolicited contact, according to the statement.",
      "Campus authorities were later connected to the service member by the Worcester Police Department, which provided a starkly different account.",
      "He told campus police that he had been home to attend his grandmother\u2019s funeral and began messaging with someone on Tinder because he \u201cjust wanted to be around people that were happy,\u201d according to the statement.",
      "He and Brainard planned to connect, he told police, and she invited him to meet at a campus alumni hall, according to the statement.",
      "Attacked by a mob",
      "He had been inside the building for a few minutes, the statement says, \u201cwhen a group of people came out of nowhere and started calling him a pedophile and accusing that he liked 17-year-old girls.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was unable to leave due to being grabbed and held back from leaving,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThe subject reported that he was able to break free and ran up the stairs being chased by a group of 25 or more people.\u201d",
      "He told police he was chased to his car, punched in the head and had his car door slammed on him, the statement says. After he was able to flee campus, he dialed police, the statement says.",
      "A review of campus security video detailed in the statement confirmed the victim\u2019s account. The video captured students berating the victim as a sexual predator, recording the pursuit as they chased him and high-fiving one another a few minutes later, after one of the accused was captured slamming the man\u2019s car door on his head, according to the statement.",
      "A review of Tinder messages showed the service member believed he was meeting an 18-year-old, the statement says. The woman's profile indicated she was 18. When officers followed up with Brainard about where the information about an underage girl came from, the statement adds, \u201cshe could not answer.\u201d",
      "\u2018Call police or kick their ass\u2019",
      "Randall told authorities that after having learned that Brainard was messaging with the victim, six students came up with the idea of luring him to campus.",
      "\u201cHe reported that it was like the Chris Hansen videos where you \u2018catch a predator and either call the police or kick their ass,\u2019\u201d the statement says, referring to the host of \u201cTo Catch a Predator.\u201d",
      "The show, which aired from 2004 to 2007, used hidden cameras and people posing as minors in online chat rooms to lure alleged predators to houses where Hansen would confront them. The program did not condone or include any violence.",
      "After a Texas prosecutor who was the subject of one of the show\u2019s investigations died by suicide, his family sued the network for $105 million in 2007. NBC settled the following year for an undisclosed amount and said the matter had been \u201camicably resolved.\u201d",
      "In his interview with campus police, Randall said he and several others made suggestions about what Brainard should say in her messages to the service member, the statement says. After they lured him to campus, the group then \u201crallied\u201d others at the college using an alumni group chat \u2014 a move that provoked the \u201crabid response\u201d from the dozens who participated in the event, according to the statement.",
      "Afterward, according to the statement, Randall acknowledged to authorities: \u201cThis got out of hand and went bad.\u201d"

      "Winter weather has added another deadly challenge.",
      "\u201cIt is so cold now in winter that ... there have been three newborn deaths just in the last week because of the tents and the lack of foods available for them unfortunately,\u201d Dr. Mimi Sayed, an American emergency physician volunteering at the Al-Aqsa hospital, told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cNothing compares to what\u2019s happening in\u00a0Gaza,\u201d said Sayed.",
      "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, sounded the alarm Friday, warning they expected more infants to be affected by hypothermia. Speaking in a voice recording published by MSF in a post on X, Dr. Mohammad Abu Tayyem, a pediatrician at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, said that doctors were seeing an \"increased number of children with respiratory infections like acute bronchiolitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections and even bronchial asthma exacerbations.\"",
      "And, he said, \u201cdue to the increased number of premature babies and the low-birth-weight babies in this period in the ICU, we\u2019re expecting more babies to come to our ER complaining from hypothermia\" as he attributed their suffering to the cold weather and poor conditions children are being forced to live in amid Israel's offensive.",
      "Babies are unable to regulate their body temperature in the same way that adults can, making them particularly vulnerable to cold weather without adequate shelter and warm clothing \u2014 both in short supply.",
      "Asked to respond to reports of infants displaced by Israel\u2019s assault dying from the cold weather, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters the military had looked into those reports but could not find any \u201cinformation we can work with\u201d from sources who were \u201cnot Hamas-related.\u201d\u201cThe reality of war is a tough thing and obviously that\u2019s part of why we don\u2019t start wars,\u201d he said on Thursday, adding that hostages taken captive during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack were also experiencing winter in Gaza. He said Israeli officials were working to bring \u201cequipment for the winter\u201d into the enclave, but did not elaborate on those efforts.",
      "Meanwhile, video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed families across a tent encampment in Khan Younis trying to shovel and sweep dirty rainwater from their tents, while others gathered around a soup kitchen in the rain, holding out pots and pans and crying out for warm food.",
      "\u201cWe had a wonderful life, but look at how we have become,\u201d said 11-year-old Marwan Amer El-Akhres, who was helping his family try to move water away from their tent. \u201cWe have become so humiliated.\"",
      "\u201cIt is very hard and cold. It\u2019s freezing,\u201d he said.",
      "Recalling a time when his family, displaced from Rafah, had been able to sit safe and warm in their home \u201cenjoying the warm of winter,\u201d he said: \u201cNow, look at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIs this a life?\u201d"

      "2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Ukraine.",
      "After a year of significant gains for Russia, looming large is the presidency of Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war in \u201ca single day\u201d \u2014 even if he has indicated that he is in part sympathetic to Moscow\u2019s arguments and has remained skeptical of promising open-ended military aid to Kyiv.",
      "Some experts believe that, for this reason, it\u2019s likely that Ukraine, and Europe, will need to prepare for a prolonged war.",
      "\u201cTrump, with his unpredictable policy on military support for Kyiv and on how to end the war, will be the biggest challenge,\u201d Justyna Gotkowska, the deputy director of the Center for Eastern Studies, a think tank based in Warsaw, said in an op-ed last week.",
      "After more than 1,000 days of war, Ukraine is running short on manpower while the Kremlin has stepped up bombings of cities and infrastructure, launching missiles, drones and artillery rounds at civilian targets.",
      "Nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by the Russian forces, though Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive efforts have driven the fight onto Russian land, where large swathes of territory in the Kursk border region have been seized.",
      "And while the country has successfully fended off a number of air attacks in recent months, the Ukrainian military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, conceded on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops have advanced significantly in the eastern Donetsk region in the past few months. The area of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian defense linchpin, could especially pave the way for Moscow to seize swathes of more territory.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now walks a diplomatic tightrope.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy\u2019s greater challenge right now is to ensure continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine,\u201d said Ann Dailey, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank.",
      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cWe are not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukrainian membership in NATO for 20 years, as well as to introduce a peacekeeping contingent of British and European forces into Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov told state-owned TASS news agency.",
      "\u201cSince NATO\u2019s long-standing expansion was one of the main causes of the Ukrainian crisis, ensuring Ukraine\u2019s nonaligned status remains among the goals of the special military operation that must be achieved,\u201d the foreign minister said.",
      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",
      "Dailey said it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to think that \u201cyou could enter negotiations with Russia and believe you would get any concessions that you did not force them to concede at the tip of a spear.\u201d",
      "Put simply, Russia currently sees itself as having the advantage both militarily and politically.",
      "\u201cUnder these conditions, I do not anticipate Russia would concede much of anything,\u201d she added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s unease is underscored by the seemingly cordial terms between the American and Russian leaders.",
      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

      "Lead pollution likely dropped the average IQ in ancient Rome by 2.5 to 3 points, a study found.The research is based on an analysis of lead concentrations in ice cores extracted from Greenland.The findings offer evidence that lead may have contributed to Rome\u2019s downfall, a question historians and experts have debated for decades.",

      "The research is based on an analysis of lead concentrations in ice cores extracted from Greenland.",
      "The findings offer evidence that lead may have contributed to Rome\u2019s downfall, a question historians and experts have debated for decades.",
      "In ancient Rome, toxic lead was so pervasive in the air that it most likely dropped the average person\u2019s IQ by 2.5 to 3 points, new research suggests.",
      "The study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, amplifies long-standing questions about what role, if any, lead pollution played in the empire\u2019s downfall.",
      "The authors linked lead found in ice samples from Greenland to ancient Roman silver smelters and determined that the incredible amount of background pollution they produced would have affected much of Europe.",
      "Using studies about lead exposure in modern society, the researchers were able to determine how much lead most likely ended up in Romans\u2019 bloodstreams and the effects that would have had on their cognition.",
      "Lead, a powerful neurotoxin, remains a public health menace today. There is no safe amount to have in your body. Exposure is associated with learning disabilities, reproductive problems, mental health issues and increased risk of hearing loss, among other effects.",
      "The researchers behind the new study said the findings are the first clear example of widespread industrial pollution in history.",
      "\u201cHuman or industrial activities 2,000 years ago were already having continental-scale impacts on human health,\u201d said a lead author of the paper, Joe McConnell, a climate and environmental scientist at the Desert Research Institute, a nonprofit research campus in Reno, Nevada. \u201cRoman-era lead pollution is the earliest unambiguous example of human impacts on the environment.\u201d",
      "The story of the ancient pollution was buried in the Greenland ice sheet.",
      "The chemical composition of ice there and in other polar regions can yield key clues about what past environments were like. As snow falls, melts and compresses to form layers of ice, the chemicals trapped inside offer a kind of timeline.",
      "\u201cYou built up this layer cake year after year of environmental history,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "By drilling, extracting and processing long cylinders of ice, scientists can measure qualities like the atmospheric carbon dioxide in past climates or, as in this case, lead concentrations over time.",
      "The researchers analyzed three ice cores and found that lead concentrations rose and fell over roughly a millennium in ways that corresponded to key events in Rome\u2019s economic history. The level rose, for example, when Rome organized control over present-day Spain and ramped up silver production in the region.",
      "\u201cFor every ounce of silver you might produce, you might produce 10,000 ounces of lead,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAs you\u2019re producing silver, the Romans were smelting and mining silver for their coinage, for their economy, and they were introducing a lot of lead into the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "During the smelting process, lead would attach to particles of dust in the atmosphere, McConnell said. A small fraction of those particles were blown and deposited in Greenland.",
      "Once the researchers determined how much lead was concentrated in Greenland\u2019s ice, they used climate modeling systems to figure out how much lead the Romans must have been emitting to pollute Greenland to the level observed.",
      "Then the team analyzed modern-day information about exposure to lead and determined the health effects of the atmospheric lead present during the Pax Romana, a time of peace in the empire that lasted from 27 B.C.E. to A.D. 180.",
      "The researchers found that the average lead exposure was about one-third of what it was in the United States in the late 1970s, when the use of leaded gasoline was at its peak and before the Clean Air Act. The Roman lead levels were roughly twice what American children are exposed to today, McConnell said.",
      "The researchers think people living closest to silver mines in Iberia (modern-day Spain) would have had the most lead in their blood.",
      "\u201cVirtually nobody escaped,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "However, the results most likely do not speak to the full scope of lead\u2019s health consequences in ancient Rome, because Roman people were exposed through other sources, including wine sweetened in lead-lined vessels, lead plumbing and lead drinking goblets.",
      "Lead \u201cwas everywhere\u201d in ancient Rome, said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a lead expert and a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who was not involved in the study. So the new research is limited because it assesses only atmospheric lead, he said, which the authors acknowledge.",
      "\u201cTheir estimates are likely to be an underestimate,\u201d Lanphear said.",
      "Still, the findings may invigorate ongoing debates over what effect lead had on the decline of ancient Rome, since the study offers evidence that exposure may, indeed, have played a role.",
      "Historians and medical experts have for decades debated whether lead contributed to the empire\u2019s downfall and to what degree. Researchers in the 1980s suggested that Rome\u2019s elites were stricken with gout and erratic behavior because they drank copious amounts of lead-laced wine.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite convinced lead was one of the factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, but it was only one factor. It\u2019s never just one thing,\u201d Lanphear said.",
      "Joe Manning, a professor of history at Yale University, said most researchers think Rome fell for myriad reasons, including plagues, economic problems and shifts in climate. Manning said it is important to remember that ancient Rome was a tough place to survive, with life expectancies around 25 to 30 years.",
      "\u201cYou do not want to go into a city in the ancient world under any circumstances. It\u2019d be the last place you\u2019d want to visit. They\u2019re so dirty, disease-ridden, dysentery everywhere,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThe lead is on top of really horrible sanitary conditions.\u201d"

      "\u201cI did not take this step lightly,\u201d he added.",
      "Hundreds of protesters, including Jewish students and left-wing activists, gathered outside the presidential office in Vienna holding banners to boo and whistle, shouting \u201cNazis out.\u201d",
      "The development marks another boost for far-right lawmakers in Europe, where extreme political parties have gained momentum as incumbent centrists have struggled to build coalitions and hold on to power.",
      "In France, Marine\u00a0Le Pen's National Rally party has surged in the polls, while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance has slumped. In neighboring Germany, Alternative for Germany, which is currently being monitored by Berlin\u2019s own intelligence agency for suspected extremism, is expected to fare well in next month's election following a collapse in support for current Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",
      "\u201cThe overall trend is unmistakable: The far right is gaining ground,\u201d Matthijs Rooduijn, a politics professor at the University of Amsterdam told NBC News in October.",
      "\u201cThe ideas of these parties have been legitimized by many mainstream right-wing parties, and political as well as media discourse has shifted to the right,\u201d Rooduijn added. \u201cWhat was once considered radical has now become the new normal for many voters.\u201d",
      "Van der Bellen's announcement constitutes a major departure in the direction of Austrian lawmakers' attempts to form a government after the ruling conservatives held a crisis meeting Sunday following the resignation of current Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Saturday.",
      "The meeting, aimed at countering the FP\u00d6 by cobbling together a centrist coalition of the Social Democrats and liberals, was ultimately unsuccessful and left Van der Bellen\u00a0with few options.",
      "The Austrian president, whose job it is to ensure a workable government is created, had been trying to form a coalition since October. But those attempts failed after Nehammer\u2019s conservative Austrian People\u2019s Party, along with other parties, refused to work with the far-right FP\u00d6.",
      "Nehammer\u2019s party indicated it was open to collaborating under Kickl\u2019s leadership following his resignation.",
      "During Austria\u2019s parliamentary elections in September, the FP\u00d6 won an unprecedented 28.8% of the vote and came out on top. Opinion polls suggest that if an election were held now, support for the far-right party would be even stronger.",
      "The Russia-friendly FP\u00d6, which was founded by former Nazis, advocates for strict border controls and the suspension of asylum rights through emergency laws. It also wants to oversee the \u201cremigration of uninvited foreigners\u201d and to create a more \u201chomogeneous\u201d society."

    "summary": "Supporters of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol have adopted some of the symbols and slogans associated with President-elect Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 In some ways it is a familiar scene: American flags, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d posters and the occasional hat declaring \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d",
      "It isn\u2019t a Donald Trump rally, however, but a protest by conservative supporters of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who could become the East Asian democracy\u2019s first sitting president to be arrested after he plunged it into political instability last month with his botched attempt to declare martial law.",
      "Though opinion polls suggest the majority of South Koreans support removing Yoon from office, his impeachment and potential arrest have brought backlash from members of his base, some of whom have amplified claims of election fraud and other conspiracy theories promoted by right-wing YouTubers.",
      "Many of Yoon\u2019s supporters wave American flags to express support for the longtime South Korean alliance with the United States, whose backing they see as crucial for protecting South Korean democracy in a hostile neighborhood.",
      "They have also adopted some of the symbols and slogans associated with Trump, whom they see as a political kindred spirit to Yoon and one who is similarly persecuted.",
      "\u201cSouth Koreans, particularly conservatives, see parallels between Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 slogan and their own aspirations for a \u2018Great Korea,\u2019\u201d Choi Jin Nyoung, a commentator and lawyer in Seoul, told NBC News on Monday. \u201cThey view Trump\u2019s agenda as aligning with their desire to restore national pride and progress, especially after what they perceive as political and diplomatic setbacks during previous administrations.\u201d",
      "Yoon supporters cheered Friday when officials failed to execute an arrest warrant for Yoon at his official residence in central Seoul after an hourslong standoff with his security service. Thousands of pro-Yoon protesters had gathered outside the residence in recent days to \u201cprotect\u201d him from being arrested.",
      "Many of them dismissed the investigations against Yoon as politically motivated, echoing accusations by Trump supporters.",
      "\u201cThese actions were carried out as an overreach from the start, and the investigations were initiated unlawfully,\u201d Gang Sung-min, a pro-Yoon protester, said Friday. \u201cSo I believe that the people can step in to block such illegal acts.\u201d",
      "Investigators are seeking to question Yoon about possible rebellion charges in connection with his Dec. 3 martial law order, which he lifted hours later after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Warrants issued last week to detain Yoon and search his residence were set to expire at midnight local time, and the anti-corruption agency leading the joint investigation was said to be seeking an extension.",
      "Yoon, who narrowly won election to a single five-year term in 2022, has struggled to advance his legislative agenda against the opposition-controlled parliament. In a surprise late-night address last month, he said martial law was necessary to combat \u201canti-state\u201d forces he accused of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist North Korea, with which the South technically remains at war.",
      "He has also said the April parliamentary election, which the main opposition Democratic Party won in a landslide, was fraudulent, a claim for which there is no evidence. During his martial law declaration, Yoon sent troops to the National Election Commission headquarters to investigate his allegations, though the order was lifted before they were able to seize any computer equipment or personnel.",
      "Though Yoon provided no evidence for his accusations, they resonated with his supporters, many of whom are older, Christian conservatives whose families fled what is now North Korea decades ago and who support Yoon\u2019s hard line on the nuclear-armed state. They are also deeply suspicious of communist-ruled China and see both Yoon and Trump as tough on Beijing.",
      "The liberal Democratic Party, which controls the legislature and could win back the presidency if a new election is held, is perceived as more open to engagement with both China and North Korea.",
      "\u201cIf impeachment proceeds and the current administration collapses, many conservatives fear that this could lead to not just a change in leadership but a national crisis,\u201d Chung Hyuk Jin, a moderate commentator, said by phone Monday.",
      "Yoon supporters have accused China without evidence of driving the anti-Yoon protests. They have also embraced Yoon\u2019s false claims of election fraud, as well as Trump\u2019s.",
      "\u201cSouth Korea, like the United States, is being destroyed by electoral fraud. It is collapsing,\u201d said Ahn Jae-eun, 63, whose parents fled to South Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War.",
      "Ahn said that Yoon had declared martial law \u201cin his efforts to uncover the truth about this electoral fraud,\u201d that his impeachment was illegal and that South Korean media was spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen our President Trump takes office on Jan. 20, together with President Yoon Suk Yeol, the truth about these electoral frauds will be fully uncovered,\u201d she said.",
      "Even Yoon\u2019s own lawyers have referred to Trump in their legal filings, citing last summer\u2019s Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity to argue that Yoon was exercising his executive authority and that there was no violation of fundamental rights during the short-lived martial law order.",
      "\u201cThe repeal request was made, the president accepted it, and the troops were immediately withdrawn, right? So there was no specific harm or damage done,\u201d one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, Bae Bo-yoon, said Friday.",
      "Stella Kim reported from Seoul and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

      "Corruption is the biggest threat to China\u2019s Communist Party, President Xi Jinping said on Monday, in a clear warning that the ruling party is resolved to tackle a long-running problem that is now entrenched in many strata of Chinese society.",
      "China was rocked last year by corruption probes into high-profile individuals ranging from a deputy central bank governor to a former chairman of its biggest\u00a0oil and gas\u00a0company, adding to unease in an economy struggling to secure a firm footing and a society grappling with a\u00a0fading sense of wealth.",
      "The list also included a top Chinese admiral,\u00a0Miao Hua, whose fall from grace comes at a time when Beijing is trying to modernize its armed forces and boost its battle readiness.",
      "Not only is corruption still pervading China, it is actually on the rise, Xi said at the start of a three-day congress of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the country\u2019s top anti-graft watchdog.",
      "\u201cCorruption is the biggest threat to our party,\u201d he warned.",
      "To underline the scale of the problem, the CCDI said in recent days that a record 58 \u201ctigers,\u201d or senior officials, were probed last year.",
      "Of those investigated, 47 were at the vice-ministerial level or above, including Tang Renjian, former minister of agriculture and rural affairs, and Gou Zhongwen, former head of the General Administration of Sport.",
      "Even former high-ranking officials were not spared, such as Wang Yilin, who stepped down as chairman of state-owned China National Petroleum Corp in 2020 on reaching retirement age.",
      "The crackdown will continue, said Andrew Wedeman, a professor at Georgia State University.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how Xi could afford to back off at this point,\u201d Wedeman said. \u201cA dozen years after he set out to cleanse the senior ranks, Xi is still finding widespread corruption at the top of the party-state and the PLA.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has also been swept by a wave of purges since 2023. Li Shangfu was removed as defense minister after seven months and his predecessor Wei Fenghe was expelled from the party for \u201cserious violations of discipline,\u201d a euphemism for corruption.",
      "Wedeman said it appeared that the pool that Xi is drawing on as replacements also included corrupt officials.",
      "\u201cIf Xi is promoting corrupt officials, this suggests the party\u2019s internal vetting apparatus is not functioning effectively or, more seriously, is itself corrupted.\u201d",
      "China admits its anti-corruption efforts face new challenges, with traditional forms of corruption such as accepting cash becoming more insidious.",
      "\u201cA businessman might offer me money directly, and I\u2019d refuse,\u201d said Fan Yifei, a former deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.",
      "\u201cBut if he gives it in the form of stocks or other assets, not directly to me but to my family, that\u2019s a whole different matter,\u201d state media quoted Fan as saying.",
      "Even the lowly \u201cflies\u201d and \u201cants\u201d in China\u2019s vast bureaucracy will not be spared, a program aired on Sunday by the national television broadcaster showed.",
      "The first of four episodes of \u201cFighting Corruption for the People\u201d that ran ahead of the CCDI meeting focused on grassroots corruption, including a case of how a primary school director profited from kickbacks from on-campus meals and another on how a rural official took bribes from farm project contractors.",
      "\u201cCompared to the \u2018tigers\u2019 far away, the public feels more strongly about the corruption around them,\u201d said Sun Laibin, a professor at Peking University\u2019s School of Marxism.",
      "The anti-corruption fight must reach the \u201chearts\u201d of the masses, he said on the program, so that they can \u201cdeeply feel\u201d the care of the party."
