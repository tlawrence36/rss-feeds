      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",
      "Even in this first outing, his performance drew bravos from the audience and critics.",
      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",
      "Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the opening \u201cRing\u201d installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment he walked onstage, everyone sensed his God-like presence,\u201d Dudamel said in an email to the AP. \u201cWhen he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.\u201d",

      "As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment I became a man, my mom told me: \u2018When you walk in the street, don\u2019t walk too tall. Make yourself small, so you don\u2019t stand out, so you can survive,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhen I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn\u2019t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.\u201d",
      "Green will perform the \u201cWalk\u00fcre\u201d Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new \u201cRing\u201d cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP.",
      "Among his colleagues, Green is known for his relentless work ethic and perfectionism.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s extremely hard on himself,\u201d said Gaffigan, who is conducting the Santa Fe performances and recalled the first time he heard from Green after he was cast.",
      "\u201cHe called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,\u201d Gaffigan said, \u201cAnd from the first words on the telephone, he said, \u2018I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?\u2019 \u2026 I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting this time.",
      "\u201cThe dedication to the text and the music and the rhythms is at the highest level of preparation I\u2019ve heard in a long time,\u201d Gaffigan added. \u201cHe knows how serious this is. It\u2019s a major ascent in his career.\u201d",
      "Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt was the Second Knight in \u2018Parsifal\u2019 ... and I was rehearsing for three months for a role that literally has 61 seconds of music,\u201d Green said..",
      "\u201cI was like, this is at the Met, I need to be perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of mentality has been my saving grace, because I put everything I\u2019ve got into it, vocally, physically, mentally.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kristin Scott Thomas draws on her own childhood losses for her directorial debut \u201cMy Mother's Wedding.\u201d",
      "Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. Both were Royal Navy pilots who died in crashes. The first happened when she was 5. The second at age 11. Thomas uses these facts, a kind of origin story, as the basis for her directorial debut, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a comedic drama about family, trauma and getting on with it that opens in theaters Friday.",
      "Knowing that the story comes from a real place is important for the experience. It gives \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a perfectly average film that doesn\u2019t quite land the way it should, an emotional depth that it\u2019s otherwise lacking. This is a strange shortcoming considering the caliber of the cast, including Thomas as the bride to be, and Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham and Scarlett Johansson as her daughters. But it\u2019s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren\u2019t guarantees that a movie will work.",
      "In the film, the deaths may be in the distant past, but they continue to haunt Diana\u2019s (Thomas) adult daughters as she prepares to marry another. Diana\u2019s new man is not a dashing pilot, forever preserved in handsome youth. Geoffrey (James Fleet) is very gray. He likes to talk about birds, ospreys in particular, has never had children and comes with a very silly last name (Loveglove) that she plans to take. Her girls are not exactly impressed, though they\u2019ve all got their own stuff to deal with.",
      "It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I\u2019ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she\u2019s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto).",
      "Miller\u2019s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest \u201cDame Of Darkness\u201d is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. And Beecham is the youngest Georgina, a nurse who suspects that her husband is having an affair. To find out, the girls hire a private detective to surveil her house and show them the footage after the wedding.",
      "It's a very busy, fraught weekend for everyone. There\u2019s lots of fretting over why Katherine won\u2019t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. There\u2019s lingering anxiety about their mom marrying this man who seems so unlike the two heroes that came before and much discussion about the importance of last names, marriage and making sure kids feel like they belong to someone. Some things get resolved, but it's hard to shake the feeling that everyone might need a new therapist by the end.",

      "Palmieri was born in New York\u2019s Spanish Harlem on December 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle\u2019s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums.",

      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed\u2019s band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",

      "Staff specifically watch out for micro miniskirts, vintage Victoria Secret lingerie tanks and baby tees, she said. For every item bought, the seller receives either 30% cash or 50% store credit of the resale price.",
      "\u201cY2K style is really flashy and very exciting and visually enticing,\u201d Tercek said. \u201cPhysical expression is really important right now due to the circumstances of the world. People are wanting to show who they are authentically and be able to experiment with clothing.\u201d",
      "Downing Peters sees \"logo-mania and the resurgence of a lot of these cherished Y2K brands. Like, much to my horror, I\u2019m seeing students wearing Von Dutch again and True Religion jeans, brands that I cared a lot about when I was younger.\u201d",
      "The sustainable nature of buying secondhand also appeals to consumers, the experts said.",
      "Gen Z has \"this awareness of fashion sustainability and the ills of mainstream mass fashion, and the idea that you can shop responsibly by shopping secondhand without sacrificing style and individuality,\u201d Downing Peters said.",
      "Brown said she is sometimes hesitant to resell Y2K-era clothing because some was made poorly durjng the industry\u2019s fast-fashion economics then. However, she emphasized, Y2K-era denim is much higher quality that current-day denim, making it more valuable.",
      "Looking ahead, Brown believes Y2K pieces will remain in consumer\u2019s closets but will be styled in a more individualized way.",
      "\u201dPeople will take bits and pieces of Y2K style with them and add it to just their overall style,\u201d she said.",
      "As for what comes next? McClendon says 2010s style could be on the horizon, so hold on to those infinity scarves, skinny jeans or combat boots you may have tucked away.",

      "Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, \u201cWeapons,\" and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If there\u2019s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie \u201cWeapons,\u201d it\u2019s that the best laughs won\u2019t come from the jokes he writes.",
      "The film follows Cregger\u2019s 2022 solo directorial debut \u201cBarbarians,\u201d the widely celebrated genre-bending horror. This time, the young director bends even more, spinning a town into chaos when all children but one from the same classroom mysteriously vanish, leaving a trail of questions in their place.",
      "The Warner Bros. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious \u2014 a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIf the humor is coming from an authentic reaction that a character\u2019s having, then it works,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that didn\u2019t make it into the movie that I thought were going to be so funny. And then we did a test screening, and nobody laughed and I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s gotta go.\u201d",
      "Paranoia runs deep in the film. The town's heartbroken parents are represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Archer, whose son was among the missing. The students\u2019 teacher, played by Julia Garner, is determined to solve the mystery, despite parents blaming her for the disappearances.",
      "The humor here comes naturally, Cregger said, as characters navigate the absurd events happening around them.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not playing for the laugh, otherwise you lose the laugh,\u201d said Brolin, whose character stumbles through his grief, a state ripe for what he called genuine and \u201cembarrassingly funny\u201d moments.",
      "If 17 kids up and ran out of their homes at 2:17 a.m. one morning with no trace, what would a community do? That question drove \u201cWeapons,\u201d painting a picture of a town left reeling by the mystery.",
      "The film setting \u2014 the fictional small town of Maybrook, Illinois \u2014 is just as integral to the plot as any of its main characters. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie\u2019s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are \u201copposite side of the same coin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because this isn\u2019t even like a proper horror film,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it\u2019s kind of its own genre, in a way.\u201d",
      "The town\u2019s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Parents are outraged, storming into town halls and angrily demanding answers from the police, the school and, most pointedly, the students\u2019 teacher. Yet, when Garner\u2019s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage.",

      "But \u201cWeapons\u201d lends the characters a layer of depth that allowed horror, a genre he said is typically treated as cosmetic, to suddenly have \u201cdepth, and humor and absurdity,\u201d which, coupled with his own adult daughter\u2019s love of \u201cBarbarian,\u201d was enough to convince him to sign on.",
      "The movie subtly mocks suburban life, as goriness and horror occur under the sights of nosy neighbors, corrupt police departments and struggling relationships.",

Gandy, the schoolteacher, is harassed by parents for her missing students, but is secretly battling alcoholism.

Paul Morgan, played by Alden Ehrenreich, is a local beat police officer with secrets of his own.",
      "\u201cEvery character is perceived in a certain way and then every character breaks,\u201d Brolin said. \u201cIt all comes down to this very base thing: What if you lost the thing that you value the most? How do you deal?\u201d",
      "For Ehrenreich, who\u2019s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, \u201cWeapons\u201d offered a different pace, but its horror wasn\u2019t what drew him in. Rather, he was captivated by the film\u2019s depth and weirdness.",
      "\u201cThe weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I\u2019ve read in years,\u201d Ehrenreich said.",

      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

      "Anyway, they go about their days. Lily, in Tess\u2019 body, plays pickleball awkwardly with husband Ryan (Mark Harmon is back, in a thankless part). Harper, in Anna\u2019s body, goes to a pre-wedding tango lesson with Eric, with disastrous results. Meanwhile Anna and Tess, in their teen bodies, feast on junk food with impunity. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten real dairy since the Bush administration,\u201d one says.",
      "Curtis, aka Lily, gets her best moment in a drugstore, when her hubby asks her to get supplies from the \u201csenior\u201d aisle, and she stockpiles everything from adult diapers to enemas. Lohan's at her comic best when, as Harper, she tries to flirt the way she thinks her mother would. She\u2019s flirting with Jake (Chad Michael Murray) \u2014 yes, the hunky guy from the original \u2014 and her flirting is so weird, Jake thinks she's having a stroke.",
      "It all barrels toward a conclusion that we won\u2019t spoil. Will the wedding be derailed by the efforts of Lily and Harper? Will that derailment be temporary? Will the sisters-to-be reach an understanding? Will Lohan get to play the electric guitar? Will everyone grow to appreciate each other?",
      "That last question, we can answer. Of course they will. Whoever they are, and whatever they just did.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d a Walt Disney Studios release, has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor thematic elements, rude humor, language and some suggestive references.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Sangha was one of the two biggest targets in the investigation of Perry's death, along with Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who pleaded guilty to ketamine distribution last month. Perry's personal assistant, his friend and another doctor also entered guilty pleas and are cooperating with prosecutors. All are awaiting sentencing.",
      "Perry, who was found dead at age 54 at his home on Oct. 23, 2023, had been getting ketamine from his regular doctor for treatment of depression, an increasingly common off-label use for the surgical anesthetic.",
      "But prosecutors say when the doctor wouldn't give Perry as much as he wanted, he illegally sought more from Plasencia, then still more from Sangha, who they say presented herself as \"a celebrity drug dealer with high quality goods.\u201d",
      "Perry's assistant and friend said in their plea agreements that they acted as middlemen to buy large amounts of ketamine for Perry from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash a few days before his death. Prosecutors allege that included the doses that killed Perry.",

      "When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive \u201cstarburst\u201d finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album \u201cExile on Main St.\u201d at Keith Richards\u2019 rented villa in the south of France.",

      "\u201cAn independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar\u2019s provenance one way or the other,\u201d she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press.",
      "While its ownership is contested, there\u2019s no disputing the instrument\u2019s starring role in rock history. It was owned in the early 1960s by Keith Richards, who played it during the Rolling Stones\u2019 first appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in 1964. The Met says that performance \u201cignited interest in this legendary model.\u201d",
      "The guitar \u2013 nicknamed the \u201cKeithburst\u201d \u2013 was also played by guitar legends Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Taylor says he got it from Richards in 1967, two years before he joined the Stones, replacing original member Brian Jones. Jones died in 1969.",

      "\u201cIt's a tough lift, but we might be able to get there. It really means that all the films are gonna have to stand on their own,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be about getting great reviews, having that staying power, that longevity in the marketplace.\u201d",
      "Newcomer comedy \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters. That was on par with projections and also in line with the first movie in the series, which brought in $23 million in 2022. Paramount\u2019s slapstick comedy, \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d also in its debut weekend, snagged the third box office spot, earning $17 million from 3,344 locations.",
      "Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for \u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d coupled with strong audience reaction scores, \u201cshould point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall.\"",
      "James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d followed with $8.7 million.",
      "The horror movie \u201cTogether\u201d had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what this month is about. It\u2019s not just about box office,\" Dergarabedian said. \"It\u2019s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.\u201d",
      "Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks \u2014 including \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d and Zach Cregger\u2019s horror movie \u201cWeapons\u201d \u2014 to give August a needed boost.",
      "The box office is currently up 9.5% from last year.",

      "In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.",
      "Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.",

      "Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.",
      "On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.",
      "Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \u201clack of danger to any person or the community.\u201d But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.",
      "In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.",

In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",

      "Harrington Street, which is one block long, will also be called \u201cJerry Garcia Street.\" He died in 1995, but the band's popularity has only grown as younger generations discover the Dead's improvisational music, which blended rock, blues, folk and other styles.",

      "Tens of thousands of fans are in San Francisco to commemorate the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary with concerts and other activities throughout the city.",
      "The latest iteration of the band, Dead & Company, with original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park\u2019s Polo Field for three days starting Friday. An estimated 60,000 attendees are expected each day.",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead played often and for free in their early years while living in a cheap Victorian home in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. The band later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love, and the Grateful Dead has become synonymous with San Francisco and its bohemian counterculture.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The mother of the man who killed four people at a Manhattan office tower home to the NFL told 911 dispatchers during a 2022 incident when he threatened to kill himself that he suffered from a sports-related concussion and other issues, new information released by Las Vegas police Tuesday revealed.",
      "Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police.",
      "He accused the football league of hiding the dangers of brain injuries linked to contact sports. Tamura didn\u2019t play professional football but played during his high school years in Southern California, where he grew up.",
      "His mother told the dispatchers on Sept. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for \"depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia.\" She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. It was one of two incidents that led to Tamura being admitted to hospitals for mental health crises.",
      "\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to kill himself,\u201d she said in the recorded 911 call. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say he made a plan, he just said he just can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d",
      "Tamura\u2019s mother placed the call from outside a Budget Suites Motel. She told dispatchers she would wait in the stairwell because she did not want Tamura to know she had called the police.",
      "\u201cHe just started crying and slamming things and said I\u2019m making him worse, so I said, \u2018I\u2019ll step outside,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be upset, but I\u2019m afraid to leave.\u201d",

      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",
      "People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.",
      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",

      "Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don\u2019t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.",
      "As Steger said, \u201cnow we\u2019re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.\"",

      "Research shows mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.",
      "But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.",
      "That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.",
      "Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to \u201cmake enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology \u201ccould change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins \u2014 often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs \u2014 and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it's ready to fight back.",
      "But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.",
      "The \u201cm\u201d stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.",
      "They take a snippet of that genetic code that carries instructions for making the protein they want the vaccine to target. Injecting that snippet instructs the body to become its own mini-vaccine factory, making enough copies of the protein for the immune system to recognize and react.",
      "Years of research show protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 both the types made with mRNA and a type made with traditional technology \u2014 does wane over time. The vaccinations provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected.",

      "Today's COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.",
      "Osterholm counts about 15 infectious disease vaccines that could benefit from mRNA technology, but that's not the only potential. Many disease therapies take aim at proteins, making mRNA a potential technique for developing new treatments. Researchers already are testing an mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine for pancreatic cancer.

      "Three new studies highlight the severe health impacts of recent wildfires on Maui and in Los Angeles",
      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",

      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",
      "The increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in a statement Tuesday that 22 projects, totaling $500 million, to develop vaccines using mRNA technology will be halted.",
      "Kennedy's decision to terminate the projects is the latest in a string of decisions that have put the longtime vaccine critic's doubts about shots into full effect at the nation's health department. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened.",
      "The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1.",
      "\u201cTo replace the troubled mRNA programs, we\u2019re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don\u2019t collapse when viruses mutate,\" Kennedy said in the video.",
      "Infectious disease experts say the mRNA technology used in vaccines is safe, and they credit its development during the first Trump administration with slowing the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Future pandemics, they warned, will be harder to stop without the help of mRNA.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,\u201d said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations.",
      "He noted mRNA technology offers potential advantages of rapid production, crucial in the event of a new pandemic that requires a new vaccine.",
      "The shelving of the mRNA projects is short-sighted as concerns about a bird flu pandemic continue to loom, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cIt's certainly saved millions of lives,\u201d Offit said of the existing mRNA vaccines.",
      "Scientists are using mRNA for more than infectious disease vaccines, with researchers around the world exploring its use for cancer immunotherapies. At the White House earlier this year, billionaire tech entrepreneur Larry Ellison praised mRNA for its potential to treat cancer.",

      "Traditionally, vaccines have required growing pieces of viruses, often in chicken eggs or giant vats of cells, then purifying that material. The mRNA approach starts with a snippet of genetic code that carries instructions for making proteins. Scientists pick the protein to target, inject that blueprint and the body makes just enough to trigger immune protection \u2014 producing its own vaccine dose.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, HHS said \u201cother uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement.\"",
      "The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. Moderna, which was studying a combination COVID-19 and flu mRNA shot, had said it believed mRNA could speed up production of flu shots compared with traditional vaccines.",
      "The abandoned mRNA projects signal a \u201cshift in vaccine development priorities,\u201d the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start \u201cinvesting in better solutions.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" Kennedy said in the statement.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was \u201churting so bad\u201d while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered.",
      "Black's attorney said they will review data kept by the device as part of an autopsy.",
      "Black died at 10:43 a.m., prison officials said. It was about 10 minutes after the execution started and Black talked about being in pain.",
      "Asked for any last words, he replied, \u201cNo sir.\u201d",
      "Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. All seven media witnesses to the execution agreed he appeared to be in discomfort. Throughout the execution, a spiritual adviser prayed and sang over Black, at one point touching his face.",
      "\u201cOh, it's hurting so bad,\" Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm.",
      "\u201cI'm so sorry. Just listen to my voice,\u201d the adviser responded.",
      "Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to turn off his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said it\u2019s unaware of any other cases with similar claims to Black\u2019s about ICDs or pacemakers. Black\u2019s attorneys said they haven\u2019t found a comparable case, either.",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of his girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya Clay, 9, and Lakeisha Clay, 6. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting Clay\u2019s estranged husband.",
      "Clay's sister said Black will now face a higher power.",
      "\u201cHis family is now going through the same thing we went through 37 years ago. I can't say I\u2019m sorry because we never got an apology,\" Linette Bell, Angela Clay's sister, said in a statement read by a victim's advocate after the execution.",
      "Black's lawyer said the execution was shameful.",
      "\u201cToday, the state of Tennessee killed a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in a violation of the laws of our country simply because they could,\" attorney Kelley Henry said.",
      "In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black\u2019s attorneys that officials must have the defibrillator deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But Tennessee's Supreme Court overturned that decision Thursday, saying the other judge lacked authority to order the change.",
      "The state disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black\u2019s defibrillator to shock him and said he wouldn\u2019t feel them regardless.",

      "She said she was especially concerned about his head movement and complaints of pain because the massive dose of pentobarbital used to kill inmates is supposed to rapidly leave them unconscious.",
      "\u201cThe fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,\u201d Henry said.",
      "Prison officials did not comment on witnesses and Black\u2019s attorney saying he appeared conscious or his complaints of pain.",
      "It was Tennessee\u2019s second execution since May, after a pause for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by state corrections officials.",
      "Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. The number of executions this year exceeds the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.",
      "Black had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest. It served as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. Black\u2019s attorneys have said a doctor can send it a deactivation command without surgery.",

That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it \u201con the merits.\"",

      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",

But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no management,\u201d he said, citing a lack of accountability.",
      "Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a \u201cmajor course correction.\u201d John shared the emails with AP and said he\u2019s received no response.",
      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",
      "In Karachi, locals told AP they didn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s fixation on polio and complained of other issues \u2014 dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cPolio eradication has created a monster,\u201d Closser said. It doesn\u2019t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.",
      "Workers see that continued mistrust every day.",
      "In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children\u2019s fertility.",

      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",
      "O'Leary noted the changes in the CDC messaging, which places personal choice before community protection.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "Policymakers decided to cut rates even though consumer prices rose 3.6% in the 12 months through June, significantly above the bank\u2019s 2% target.

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The wife of South Korea\u2019s ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared for questioning by a special prosecutor Wednesday, as investigators expanded a probe into suspicions of stock manipulation, bribery, and interference in party nominations.",

      "The conservative's abrupt and poorly planned power grab on Dec. 3 came during a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, whom he described as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon's actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.",
      "\u201cI apologize for causing concern to the people, even though I am someone insignificant,\u201d Kim told reporters as she arrived for questioning. She added that she would sincerely cooperate with the investigation, before walking away without responding to specific questions about the allegations.",

      "Through a heavy police presence, dozens of Yoon\u2019s supporters gathered outside the special prosecutor\u2019s office in downtown Seoul, waving South Korean and U.S. flags and banners in light rain.",
      "Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month and faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, resisted an attempt by investigators last week to compel him for questioning over his wife. Investigators said he took off his prison uniform and laid down on the floor of his cell in his underwear before they gave up executing the warrant to detain him.

      "Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. While in office, Yoon repeatedly dismissed calls to investigate his wife, denouncing them as baseless political attacks.",

      "Australian authorities say the Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral in four decades",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say.",
      "But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths \u2014 caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change \u2014 have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday.",
      "The change underscores a new level of volatility on the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the report said.",
      "Mike Emslie, who heads the tropical marine research agency\u2019s long-term monitoring program, said the live coral cover measured in 2024 was the largest recorded in 39 years of surveys.",
      "The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world\u2019s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said.",
      "\u201cThese are substantial impacts and evidence that the increasing frequency of coral bleaching is really starting to have detrimental effects on the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Emslie said on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhile there\u2019s still a lot of coral cover out there, these are record declines that we have seen in any one year of monitoring,\u201d he added.",
      "Emslie\u2019s agency divides the Great Barrier Reef, which extends 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) along the Queensland state coast, into three similarly-sized regions: northern, central and southern.",
      "Living coral cover shrunk by almost a third in the south in a year, a quarter in the north and by 14% in the central region, the report said.",
      "Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest \u2014 and fourth ever recorded \u2014 mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world\u2019s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s coral reef watch. So far at least 83 countries have been impacted.",
      "This bleaching event started in January 2023 and was declared a global crisis in April 2024. It easily eclipsed the previous biggest global coral bleaching event, from 2014 to 2017, when 68.2% had bleaching from heat stress.",

Australia in March this year started aerial surveys of 281 reefs across the Torres Strait and the entire northern Great Barrier Reef and found widespread coral bleaching. Of the 281 reefs, 78 were more than 30% bleached.",
      "Coral has a hard time thriving and at times even surviving in prolonged hot water. They can survive short bursts, but once certain thresholds of weeks and high temperatures are passed, the coral is bleached, which means it turns white because it expels the algae that live in the tissue and give them their colors. Bleached corals are not dead, but they are weaker and more vulnerable to disease.",
      "Coral reefs often bounce back from these mass global bleaching events, but often they are not as strong as they were before.",
      "Coral reefs are considered a \u201cunique and threatened system\u201d due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018. The world has now warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. That report said \u201ctropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.\u201d",
      "The report said back-to-back big bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef in the mid 2010s \u201csuggest that the research community may have underestimated climate risks for coral reefs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWarm water (tropical) coral reefs are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2\u00b0C, with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher. At this point, coral abundance will be near zero at many locations,\u201d the report said.",

      "The World Health Organization says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions.",
      "There is no specific treatment for chikungunya, but health workers can treat the symptoms by giving medicines to lower fevers or ease muscle pain.",

    "story": [
      "N\u00e9lida P\u00e9rez feeds street cats in Old Havana, but Cuba's worsening economic crisis is making it increasingly difficult",
      "HAVANA -- Every afternoon, 81-year-old N\u00e9lida P\u00e9rez begins her familiar walk down the cobblestone streets of Old Havana, a procession of hungry cats trailing close behind her.",
      "For years, P\u00e9rez has taken it upon herself to feed some of the street cats that roam this part of town, which is also one of the most popular tourist spots in the Cuban capital. She once relied on her own food or restaurant donations, but as the island\u2019s economic situation worsened and tourism declined, it has become increasingly difficult to provide for them.",
      "\u201cI have never in my life asked anyone for a plate of food to feed my cats,\" P\u00e9rez told The Associated Press. \"Now I see myself in difficulties because there is no tourism and there is an economic crisis.\u201d",
      "Since 2020, Cuba has faced a worsening economic crisis, driven by COVID-19 shutdowns, stricter U.S. sanctions, and an internal monetary reform that triggered inflation.",
      "Although the government provides vaccines, sterilization and some free clinics, it does not have the means to provide shelter and food for street cats and dogs. While official data is unavailable, activists say that many pet lovers have turned their homes \u2014 even small apartments \u2014 into shelters, but they are struggling to keep up with the demand and provide adequate care.",
      "\u201cThe streets will kill them,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Iglesias, a 51-year-old pharmacist who adopted five dogs and has rescued and found homes for a dozen others. Iglesias explained that the hardest part is getting food. A 20-kilo (44-pound) bag of dog food, which lasts one dog for about 45 days, costs around $80 \u2014 a sum that is out of reach for most. This forces people to feed animals with pig organ meat (offal), chicken parts or mince meat \u2014 which are also not easy to obtain.",
      "On top of that, annual vaccines cost about $20 and a vet visit is another $10, all while the average monthly salary on the island is only about $12.",
      "Experts say that the abandonment of animals in Cuba is a result of several factors, including rising food and medicine prices, the migration of hundreds of thousands of Cubans in the last five years, and a high mortality rate among older adults.",
      "\u201cPeople are more focused on their problems, which are numerous: Cubans don\u2019t have water, they don\u2019t have electricity, and getting food is becoming increasingly difficult,\u201d said Annelie Gonz\u00e1lez, one of the leaders of the Aldameros Project, a cat colony located in a park in Havana\u2019s historic center.",

Over the years, through their own efforts and some donations, they were able to install water pumps, pens for special cases, and cages for the kittens.",

He knew nothing about computers \u2014 not even how to switch one on \u2014 didn\u2019t know what coding was and didn\u2019t speak a word of English, essential for computer programming.",
      "\u201cI had no idea about English. No idea, like zero zero,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was trying at the same time to learn Greek, learn English and then also learn computer. \u2026 It was super difficult for me.\u201d",
      "But several months later, he earned his certificate.",
      "Coding opened up a new world. A couple of years ago, he set up Afghan Geeks.",
      "Jafari said he started providing online courses last December to help women in his homeland, and as an expression of gratitude for the help he received as a youngster alone in a foreign country.",
      "\u201cThe main goal was to give back to the community, especially to the Afghan women, what I had received from the other people for free,\u201d he said, sitting in his sparse one-room flat in downtown Athens.",

      "Jafari now has 28 female students in Afghanistan in three classes: beginner, intermediate and advanced.",

    "story": [
      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",
      "A top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country\u2019s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose their long-standing clients.",

      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think choppy waters are ahead because I think they\u2019re going to have some legal challenges.\u201d",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he\u2019s creating, and that\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \u201cThe rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\u201d",

      "Saving money by purchasing a lightly used car is easy, especially if it has a fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain",
      "Everybody wants to save money. Buying a lightly used car instead of a new car is one way to do that. Choosing a fuel-efficient hybrid model is another way. Combine those approaches, and you might be surprised to discover what you can drive even when you\u2019re on a tight budget. The five hybrid sedans listed below in alphabetical order are worthy of consideration due to their low prices, great EPA-estimated fuel economy, and favorable crash test ratings. Edmunds\u2019 automotive experts think they\u2019re the best used hybrid sedans for under $25,000.",
      "Thanks to its spacious back seat and large trunk, the Honda Accord Hybrid can easily accommodate a family of four or five, making it an ideal car for summer road trips and big-box shopping excursions. This midsize sedan\u2019s model lineup ranges from basic to sporty or luxurious, and depending on the version, you can expect EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of between 43 mpg and 48 mpg. Favorable crash test ratings are a bonus.",
      "Look for: Honda added a Sport trim level in 2022. A redesign for 2023 brought a more sophisticated and refined version of Honda\u2019s hybrid powertrain, which became standard on all higher-priced Accords that year.",
      "2018-2024 Honda Accord Hybrid pricing (under 50,000 miles): approximately $19,000-$25,000",
      "If the Accord Hybrid is too large, consider the smaller Insight sedan as an alternative. It gets better gas mileage, comfortably accommodates four people, and boasts a trunk as spacious as the trunks of some midsize cars. Honda based this version of the Insight on the popular Civic sedan, giving the Insight different styling and a more upscale-feeling interior. According to EPA combined estimates, you can expect 48 mpg to 52 mpg, depending on which trim level you choose. The Insight also boasts exceptionally good crash test ratings.",
      "Look for: Honda added blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert to the Insight EX and Touring in 2021.",
      "2019-2022 Honda Insight pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $21,000 to $25,000",
      "Aside from its distinctive styling and impressive technology, what helps the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid stand apart is its dual-clutch automatic transmission. That design eliminates the typical acceleration drone common to hybrids, making the Elantra more satisfying to drive. It doesn\u2019t negatively impact fuel economy either. According to EPA combined estimates, this reasonably roomy compact car averages 50-54 mpg.",
      "Look for: The Blue trim level offers the best fuel economy. In 2024, Hyundai updated the styling, added more driver assist features, and improved the infotainment system.",
      "2021-2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $18,000 to $25,000",
      "Toyota has been building Camry Hybrids for nearly two decades, and the car has earned a reputation for efficiency and longevity. Since 2018, a sense of style has also been a part of the recipe, and with the SE and XSE trim levels, there are hints of sportiness. The Camry isn\u2019t the roomiest midsize sedan available, but its EPA estimates of 46 mpg to 52 mpg, track record of durability, and impressive crash test ratings help make up for that.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to \u201cfix\u201d the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries.",
      "But they also worry Kennedy\u2019s changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren't connected to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy and other critics believe the program is \u201ctoo miserly in what it considers to be a vaccine injury,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a public health expert at Yale University. \u201cThat\u2019s created great concern that he could expand what\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine groups have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, despite scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don\u2019t cause the condition. Adding autism to the list of injuries covered by the plan \u201cwould dramatically increase the number of compensable cases, potentially bankrupting it,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits.",
      "In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program \u201cbroken\u201d and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of \u201cinefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.\u201d",
      "Kennedy didn\u2019t specify the changes he's seeking. But some of the people he\u2019s enlisted to help have a history of bringing vaccine injury cases.",
      "In June, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $150,000 contract to an Arizona law firm for \u201cexpertise\u201d in the program. The firm\u2019s Andrew Downing, an attorney specializing in vaccine injury cases, was listed in the HHS staff directory for a time.",
      "\u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who is going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,\u201d Kennedy told Tucker Carlson shortly after the award.",
      "Revamping the program would be the latest in a string of decisions that have upended U.S. vaccine policy, including this week's cancellation of research funding for vaccines using mRNA technology.",
      "Downing has had a leading role in lawsuits against Merck alleging injuries from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, including a rare movement disorder.",
      "In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records.",
      "A judge dismissed more than 120 of those cases, citing \u201ca paucity of evidence\" that Gardasil caused patients' problems.",
      "A spokesman for Kennedy declined to comment on Downing\u2019s hiring.",
      "Kennedy himself has been involved in the Gardasil litigation, as both an attorney and consultant.",
      "Before joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to \u201ca nondependent, adult son,\" according to his financial disclosures.",
      "One of Kennedy's sons is an attorney at Wisner Baum.",

      "The fund has paid out $5.4 billion, compensating about 40% of all people who filed claims.",
      "The U.S. has an \u201cethical obligation\u201d to promptly pay those harmed by government-recommended vaccines, says Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.",
      "\u201cPlus, I think it increases trust in the vaccination program if you have quick, generous compensation,\u201d Reiss said.",
      "As health secretary, Kennedy has broad powers to reshape the program.",
      "One approach could be adding new diseases and illnesses to the government table of payable injuries.",
      "In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children\u2019s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link.",
      "Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm \u2014 perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned \u2014 and add the condition to the program.",
      "In response, the federal government might have to increase taxes on vaccines to replenish the compensation fund, which would make the shots more expensive and less accessible.",
      "\u201cThen you will start to watch the vaccine program infrastructure in this country disintegrate until someone steps in,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who has clashed with Kennedy for years.",
      "A recent Senate hearing titled \u201cVoice of the Vaccine Injured\u201d appeared to make the case for expanding the program. Witnesses included two representatives from Children\u2019s Health Defense, the nonprofit group that Kennedy previously chaired and has repeatedly sued the government over vaccines.",
      "The group\u2019s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son\u2019s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.",
      "Another approach would involve removing certain vaccines from the program, making it easier to bring lawsuits against vaccine-makers. Under current law, people claiming injuries from vaccines covered by the program must first pursue a compensation claim before they can sue.",
      "In cases where the science doesn\u2019t support a connection to vaccines, lawyers might be more successful before a jury.",
      "\u201cJury trials take advantage of the fact that most jurors don\u2019t know anything about science or medicine,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThey are not going to be as easily moved by the data.\u201d",
      "Still, attorneys who bring cases before the compensation program say the process has become more burdensome and adversarial over the years.",
      "Even small changes could improve things. For instance, the statute of limitations for claims could be extended beyond the current three years, which lawyers say cuts off many potential clients.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be changes put in place that make the program easier for petitioners to navigate\u201d said Leah Durant, a vaccine injury attorney.",

      "American businesses and consumers soon will have a better idea of how President Donald Trump's foreign trade agenda might affect them now that the United States has imposed higher tariffs on products from dozens of countries.",
      "It\u2019s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual impact on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho.",
      "Exports from a majority of them are getting taxed at 15%. For a handful of countries in Asia, the rate is 19%. Products from the rest are subject to taxes of 20% to 50%. Meanwhile, a 55% tariff on Chinese-made goods is scheduled to take effect next week if a U.S.-China trade deal is not agreed on before then.",
      "Businesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump's fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June.",
      "Because tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually.",
      "The country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president's earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center",
      "The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.",
      "\"Retailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,\u201d Jonathan Gold, Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects:",
      "Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.",
      "The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.",
      "In the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term shields most of those countries' products from punishing duties.",
      "The president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India's tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration.",
      "Other duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren\u2019t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased.",
      "Shoppers should be prepared to pay more for clothes and shoes because the combined tariffs \u201cdisproportionately affect clothing and textiles,\u201d according to the Budget Lab at Yale. It estimates that shoe prices will go up 39% temporarily and stay 19% above where they are now. For apparel, the Budget Lab put the comparable figures at 37% and 18%.",

      "Trump last week signed an order to suspend the \u201cde minimis\" exemption that has allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. International e-commerce companies have widely used the rule to avoid paying customs charges.",
      "Trump withdrew the exemption in early April for goods shipped from China and Hong Kong tariff-free. It is now set to be eliminated for low-value packages from every country on Aug. 29.",

      "President Donald Trump's new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have taken effect, the latest chapter in his effort to reshape global trade",
      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries took effect Thursday, the latest chapter in the saga of Trump\u2019s reshaping of global trade. But many questions remain.",
      "Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imports of pharmaceuticals and has ordered a 100% import tax on computer chips. Most U.S. imports of copper, steel and aluminum are subject to a 50% tariff.",
      "There\u2019s still no agreement on what tariffs might apply to products shipped from China. India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia.",
      "Recent data shows uncertainty is clouding the outlook for exporters around the world as a rush to beat the tariffs during a pause for negotiation tapers off. Companies are reporting billions of dollars in higher costs or losses due to the higher import duties.",
      "Global financial markets took Thursday's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian shares and U.S. futures mostly higher.",
      "Here's where things stand in what has proven to be a fast-changing policy landscape.",
      "The tariffs announced on Aug. 1 apply to 66 countries, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. They are a revised version of what Trump called \" reciprocal tariffs,\" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else. That move triggered sell-offs in financial markets and Trump backtracked to allow time for trade talks.",
      "The president has bypassed Congress, which has authority over taxes, by invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency. That's being challenged in court, but the revised tariffs still took effect.",
      "To keep their access to the huge American market, major trading partners have struck deals with Trump. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan.",
      "Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%.",
      "Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office.",
      "\u201cWe were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Hastiadi said. \u201cWe believe we will stay competitive.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl.",
      "Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on \u201cflexible work\u201d \u2014 the gig economy \u2014 for their livelihoods, the government estimates.",
      "India also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict.",

      "NEW YORK -- Mall-based teen accessories retailer Claire's, known for helping to usher in millions of teens into an important rite of passage \u2014 ear piercing \u2014 but now struggling with a big debt load and changing consumer tastes, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.",

That marked the second time since 2018 and for a similar reason: high debt load and the shift among teens heading online away from physical stores.",
      "Claire's Chapter 11 filing follows the bankruptcies of other teen retailers including Forever 21, which filed in March for bankruptcy protection for a second time and eventually closed down its U.S. business as traffic in U.S. shopping malls fades and competition from online retailers like Amazon, Temu and Shein intensifies.",
      "Claire's, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois and founded in 1974, said that its stores in North America will remain open and will continue to serve customers, while it explores all strategic alternatives.

      "\u201cThis decision is difficult, but a necessary one,\u201d Chris Cramer, CEO of Claire\u2019s, said in a press release issued Wednesday. \u201cIncreased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire\u2019s and its stakeholders.\u201d",
      "Like many retailers, Claire's was also struggling with higher costs tied to President Donald Trump's tariff plans, analysts said.",
      "Cramer said that the company remains in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with potential strategic and financial partners. He noted that the company remains committed to serving its customers and partnering with its suppliers and landlords in other regions. Claire\u2019s also intends to continue paying employees' wages and benefits, and it will seek approval to use cash collateral to support its operations.",

At the 2024 meeting, former First Lady Jill Biden announced $500 million in new annual spending for women\u2019s health research, while Prince Harry outlined his plans to help children and their parents navigate cyberspace better.",
      "This year\u2019s meeting \u2014 held once again during United Nations General Assembly week and led by Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton \u2014 will also include Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, as well as Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O\u2019Day, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, and Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee. However, the focus this year will be on forging new solutions for economic, health, climate and humanitarian issues.",
      "\u201cThe CGI community is built for moments like this,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cThis year marks two decades of our community convening and responding directly to global crises.\u201d",
      "In previous years, CGI helped organize responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CGI estimates it has helped more than 500 million people in 186 countries over the past two decades.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has swiftly dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, arguing that many programs did not advance American interests. A number of philanthropic funders have stepped in to replace some support of humanitarian programs and public health initiatives, but many gaps remain.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency has terminated $7 billion in funding for solar programs approved under the Biden administration, including projects for nearly 1 million households in low-income communities",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program that was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households.",
      "It's the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation\u2019s shift to cleaner energy.",

      "Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump. The law eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that was approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The fund set aside $20 billion in \u201cgreen bank\u201d money for community development projects to boost renewable energy, and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,\u2033 Zeldin said. \u201cToday, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!\u201d",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families, called Zeldin\u2019s action illegal.",
      "\u201cSolar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,\u2033 Sanders said in a statement. \u201dAt a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has already targeted the \u201cgreen bank\u201d funds, first freezing the grants, then terminating the agreements altogether. Zeldin called them \u201ca clear cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme earlier this year.",
      "The EPA has argued that the tax and policy bill law repealed the green bank and allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree. They say the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and isn\u2019t affected by the law.",
      "Grant recipients have filed lawsuits challenging the administration\u2019s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.",

    "story": [
      "Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line",
      "NEW YORK -- Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line.",
      "The new company \u2014 which will trade under the \u201cPSKY\u201d ticker on Wall Street \u2014 brings Paramount's legacy Hollywood footprint, major TV networks like CBS and MTV, streaming services and more under the roof of a new power player: billionaire Skydance founder David Ellison.",
      "\u201cToday marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount\u2019s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,\" Ellison, who is now Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, said in a statement. He added that he aims to \u201chonor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content.\"",
      "The merger's close came just two weeks after it received regulatory approval from the Trump administration. While now a done deal, the path towards that approval was far from smooth sailing. Months of scrutiny and turmoil surrounded the transaction \u2014 particularly amid President Donald Trump\u2019s legal battle with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS. With the specter of the Trump administration potentially blocking the hard-fought deal with Skydance, Paramount agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to the president in early July.",
      "Critics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall. Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company\u2019s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives.",
      "When still seeking approval to buy Paramount from the Federal Communication Commission, Skydance management assured regulators that it would carefully watch for any perceived bias at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In filings just last month, the company\u2019s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody \u201ca diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum\u201d \u2014 and also noted that it plans to take a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of CBS to make \u201cany necessary changes.\u201d",
      "By the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to \u201conce-storied\u201d CBS. \u201cAmericans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,\" Carr said.",

      "Carr also pointed to other commitments from Skydance \u2014 including company assurances about ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Paramount. In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to \u201cconfirm the elimination\u201d of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount \u2014 and maintained that Skydance \u201cdoes not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.\u201d",
      "Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration\u2019s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace \u2014 and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced \u201csignificant changes\u201d to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025.",
      "The FCC approved the merger by a 2-1 vote on July 24. The regulator who opposed it, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, expressed disdain for how it all came together \u2014 pointing to \u201cmonths of cowardly capitulation to this administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,\u201d Gomez, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said in a statement. She also said the agency overstepped its authority by \u201cundermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity.\u201d",
      "Paramount's new leaders will be watched particularly closely for how they deal with CBS News, given the $16 million settlement with Trump following his complaint about last fall's \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. And the merger could also have ripple effects across other Paramount properties, including its late night and comedy programming.",
      "When first announcing the deal in July 2024, Ellison also stressed the need to transition into a \u201ctech hybrid\u201d to stay competitive in today\u2019s entertainment landscape. That included plans to \u201crebuild\u201d the Paramount+ streaming service, among wider efforts to expand direct-to-consumer offerings in a world with more entertainment options and shorter attention spans.",

      "The spill happened when a tailings dam that holds acidic and heavy metals waste from the mine collapsed, according to investigators from the Engineering Institution of Zambia, resulting in some 50 million liters (13.2 million gallons) of toxic materials flowing into the Kafue River system.",

      "A new wave of gymnasts are ready to step into the spotlight at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- There was a time, not that long ago really, when Joscelyn Roberson would combat the nerves that inevitably popped up before a major gymnastics meet by reminding herself of one very simple fact.",
      "\u201cI could be like, \u2018Oh no one\u2019s watching me,\u2019\u201d the 19-year-old said with a laugh. \u201cLike they\u2019re watching Simone (Biles). They\u2019re watching Jordan (Chiles). They\u2019re watching Suni (Lee) and Jade (Carey). Like, they are not watching me.\u201d",
      "Well, they are now.",
      "Biles, Lee, Carey and Carey are all on sabbatical from elite gymnastics, perhaps for good. And when Roberson salutes the judges during the first night of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships on Friday, the world championship gold medalist and Olympic alternate will be one of the few athletes on the floor with experience on the sport's biggest stage.",
      "\u201cMaybe they are kind of watching me (now), so it adds a different level of nerves, but I love it,\u201d Roberson said.",
      "Good thing, because she'll probably have to get used to it. Not just for Roberson, but the athletes who will find the spotlight pointing their way now that the icons who commanded it so completely have stepped aside, at least for now.",
      "A year after sending the oldest team in modern Olympic history to Paris, the average age of the competitors who will spend the weekend at Smoothie King Center taking their first tentative steps toward the 2028 Los Angeles Games is under 18.",
      "Hezley Rivera helped the Americans capture gold last summer. Now, the 17-year-old finds herself thrust into the role as one of the standardbearers for one of the marquee programs of the U.S. Olympic movement, and the external pressure that comes along with it.",
      "\u201cI definitely know that people have certain expectations, but I don\u2019t really care what people have, like, expectations-wise for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what I want and my goals, so it\u2019s kind of just focusing on what I\u2019m doing in the gym and what I am doing on the competition floor.\u201d",
      "Rivera's elite 2025 debut was bumpy. She tied for 12th at the U.S. Classic last month, well behind WOGA club teammate Claire Pease, who showed uncommon poise in her first major competition at the senior level.",
      "Yes, it wasn't the meet Rivera wanted, but the reality is the year following an Olympics is all about adjusting to the sport's updated Code of Points and plotting out what the run-up to the next Olympics might look like.",
      "That's perhaps even more true this time around, not just on the floor but off it. While a new wave of athletes who grew up idolizing Biles and Lee step towards the forefront, the organization they will represent is undergoing a significant change of its own.",
      "Li Li Leung, who nimbly guided USA Gymnastics out of the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, is stepping down at the end of the year. During her final \u201cState of the Sport\u201d address on Wednesday, Leung grew uncharacteristically emotional during what she called a \u201cbittersweet\u201d milestone.",
      "Asked if she's had any second thoughts since announcing her plan in June, Leung shook her head.",

      "Much of the groundwork has already been laid.",
      "While the organization is certainly on much stronger footing \u2014 earlier this week USA Gymnastics and NBC Sports announced they were extending their partnership through 2032, and the high-profile corporate sponsors who bailed in the aftermath of Nassar have returned \u2014 Leung stressed the job she and the rest of an organization that was in tatters when she arrived in early 2019 is hardly finished.",
      "\u201cThe transformation of USA Gymnastics and its culture is not over, it will never be over,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 attitude at USA Gymnastics. Instead, we will always be looking at how to build on what we have achieved.\u201d",
      "That remains true on the floor as well. The faces that defined the U.S.'s lengthy run of dominance \u2014 Biles most of all \u2014 are taking a well-deserved break. And while the lure of performing in a hometown Games three summers from now may eventually prod some of them back, this year will be about getting a feel for the next generation.",
      "\u201cI really look at this as a rebuilding year and it's a year of opportunity,\u201d women's program technical lead Chellsie Memmel said. \u201cMost of our Olympians haven\u2019t returned. And then the few we have are still very young. So it\u2019s really about building an opportunity for the younger ones.\u201d",
      "And for some of the newly older ones (by gymnastics standards, anyway), too.",
      "Skye Blakely is all of 20. Yet she's seen her hopes of making it to the Olympics end not once but twice because of injury. The road back from the torn right Achilles she suffered on the eve of the 2024 Olympic Trials hasn't been easy. Yet she's at a point where she can compete safely on uneven bars and balance beam. While there was a part of her that wanted to give all four events a shot, she also understands there's no rush.",
      "Back when Blakely was 13, she figured she'd be done as an elite by 20. She pointed to Biles' history-making performance last summer at 27 as proof that \u201cold\u201d isn't what it used to be.",
      "\u201cYour end is what you make it, it\u2019s not what everybody else says it is,\" she said. \u201cI say I might not go for another 10 years, but to be completely honest, I don\u2019t know what these next 10 years will look like for me at all, because I didn\u2019t even think I\u2019d still be doing elite at 20, and here we are.\u201d",

He closed his outing against the St. Louis Cardinals by striking out the side in the fourth and walked off wiping his face on a 90-degree (32 Celsius) day. Masyn Winn tossed his bat in frustration after going down swinging.",

In the first, Ohtani swung at the first pitch and reached when first baseman Alec Burleson booted the ball for an error.",
      "Ohtani joined new Hall of Famer Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui as the third Japanese-born player to reach 1,000 career hits in the major leagues. He homered and recorded eight or more strikeouts for the third time in his career and first since 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really try to think too differently on days that I pitch,\u201d Ohtani said.",
      "Ohtani retired the side in the first and second innings. He touched 100 mph on a four-seam fastball to Iv\u00e1n Herrera, who struck out swinging in the third. Jordan Walker singled leading off and stole second, the first swiped bag against Ohtani this season.",

      "Aaron Glenn played eight seasons with the New York Jets and became head coach last January",
      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Aaron Glenn had an expensive sense of style when he played for the New York Jets.",
      "Mainly because of all the fines he had to pay.",
      "The current Jets head coach was a Pro Bowl cornerback with a flair for fashion. That included his game day socks, which didn't always adhere to NFL regulations.",
      "\u201cI think he was like the most fined guy on the Jets, not because of his demeanor on the field but because of the way he wore socks,\u201d recalled former Jets teammate Jason Fabini, an offensive tackle who played with Glenn from 1998-2001. \"I think he got fined every game because he wouldn\u2019t have the green showing or something. You've got to ask him about that.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to look good.\u201d",
      "Well, he certainly played good, the hits to the bank account notwithstanding.",
      "Glenn played eight of his 15 NFL seasons with the Jets and became one of the league's top cornerbacks. He returned to his original team in 2012 as a scout for two years before coming back again last January, this time as the guy in charge.",
      "\u201cIt gives me goosebumps to see him out there, really, and to be the head coach,\u201d said Ray Mickens, a former cornerback who played with Glenn in New York from 1996-2001. \u201cGoing all the way back to our college days when we played together at Texas A&M and how he carried himself in college, seeing him be a head coach now, everything that he went through to get to where he\u2019s at right now, I think, has been nothing short of amazing.\u201d",
      "Fabini and Mickens were among about a dozen former Jets teammates who spent Tuesday at the facility to have breakfast, watch practice and celebrate Glenn's new role as a first-time NFL head coach.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to see those guys and I want those guys to be part of what we\u2019re trying to build because they\u2019ve been there and they understand exactly what it is to be a Jet,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of things that goes into playing for this team and those guys know what it is. We\u2019re teaching our guys what it is and those guys have been through it.\u201d",
      "Many of the former Jets have kept in touch with Glenn over the years, through his time as Detroit's defensive coordinator the last four years and the seven years he was a defensive backs coach, first with Cleveland and then with New Orleans.",
      "And the sense of pride they all share in Glenn's latest achievement, being back with the franchise for which they played together, is strong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he became a head coach,\u201d said Pro Football Hall of Fame center Kevin Mawae, who played with Glenn for four seasons. \"I mean you watch his career and how he played the game and how he prepared and, I mean, other than the fact of all the fines he paid for not having enough white showing in his socks, the guy did things the right way.",
      "\u201cHe was a professional on the field and in the locker room and meticulous about his game. And that\u2019s why he had such a long career and that\u2019s what\u2019s making him a successful coach.\u201d",

      "Glenn has tried to glean things from the coaches for whom he has played, including Bill Parcells, and those for whom he has coached, including Sean Payton and Campbell, and created his own approach to leading a team.",
      "He has focused on changing the culture of a franchise that has the longest active playoff drought in the NFL at 14 straight seasons. Glenn has talked a lot about finding the right guys, ones who fit the style of these current Jets.",
      "\u201cYou've got to be built for New York,\u201d Mickens said. \u201cYou've got to be built for this. And No. 1, obviously we know that A.G.\u2019s built for it and I think that he\u2019s looking for players that are built to play here.\u201d",
      "Glenn has already had to make difficult decisions, such as releasing Aaron Rodgers during the offseason \u2014 a move that didn't surprise Mickens.",

      "Glenn has also found parallels in what he and his teammates experienced when Parcells took over a team that went 1-15 under Rich Kotite in 1997 and brought New York to the AFC championship game two years later.",
      "\u201cHe knows New York and he knows what it takes to win here,\u201d Fabini said of Glenn, \"and if he wins here, what\u2019s going to happen. So I think that\u2019s awesome.\"",
      "After the Jets finished practice Tuesday, Glenn huddled his players in the middle of the field and spoke to them \u2014 with his former teammates watching and listening in awe.",
      "\u201cOh, it was phenomenal,\u201d Mawae said. \"It\u2019s great because you don\u2019t hear coaches talk like that with that kind of passion anymore. And I think it\u2019s more special when you\u2019re coaching for a team that you sweat and you bled for and that kind of thing. ... It was real passion and emotion. And the guys get it. They buy into that.",
      "\u201cAnd we\u2019re out there as former teammates, it\u2019s like, \u2018God, I\u2019d go suit up for Aaron Glenn for one play,\u2019 because that\u2019s all I've got left. But as former teammates and Jets alumni, we\u2019re excited to see one of our own take the reins of this program and hopefully turn it back to some respectability.\u201d",

      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is excited to play with the starters in the preseason opener against the Arizona Cardinals",
      "ST. JOSEPH, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is glad that coach Andy Reid is sending him onto the field with the rest of their starters when Kansas City visits the Arizona Cardinals for their preseason opener Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI don't necessarily look forward to getting hit,\u201d Mahomes added with a smile Thursday.",
      "Getting hit is exactly why some teams have eschewed playing starters at all in the preseason. When coaches finally decided it wasn't worth the risk to their most valuable players, they began sitting them for one or two games, and last year, teams such as the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles sat them for the entirety of their exhibition slate.",
      "That has never been Reid's preference, though. Nor has it been that of Mahomes, who believes it does him some good to get hit \u2014 once, at least \u2014 so that he can get into the right mindset for the rest of the preseason and ultimately the regular season.",
      "\u201cThere's always a little shock,\u201d Mahomes said.",
      "Now, don't get any misconceptions. The Chiefs might only have those starters on the field for a single series in Arizona, especially if it goes well. But the plan, at least after their final practice before their opener, was that each quarterback will get a full quarter \u2014 Mahomes the first, Gardner Minshew the second, Bailey Zappe the third and Chris Oladokun the fourth.",
      "The rest of the offense would presumably follow suit.",
      "There are certainly things that the three-time defending AFC champions want to see out of their preseason opener. Tops on the list is their new-look offense line, where first-round pick Josh Simmons has already turned some heads as the new left tackle and Kingsley Suamataia has the inside track on replacing two-time All-Pro Joe Thuney at left guard.",
      "The Chiefs have invested heavily in their offensive line, both in draft capital and financial resources, over the past couple years, and the need to upgrade the left side in particular became evident in their Super Bowl loss in February.",
      "There is also some competition for the final spots at wide receiver, and some different names could get some extended looks with the first-team offense. That's because Rashee Rice is sidelined with a groin injury and Marquise Brown with an ailing ankle.",
      "\u201cI think (my advice) is go out there and do what they're doing this camp,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt's going to be a bigger stage going up against another team, but I think Coach Reid prepares us better than anybody else in the league to go out there and play your best football. We practice hard and we practice fast so when it gets to the game, it's not that huge step up.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's plan for 100% tariffs on non-U.S. computer chips is causing confusion among businesses and trading partners",
      "President Donald Trump's plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners \u2014 boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications.",
      "The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device \u2014 from an iPhone to a car \u2014 were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country.",
      "\"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that companies that \"made a commitment to build\" in the U.S. would be spared the import tax, even if they are not yet producing those chips in American factories.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u201cBut if you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge.\u201d",
      "Wall Street investors interpreted that as good news not just for U.S. companies like AMD, Intel and Nvidia, but also for the biggest Asian chipmakers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that have been working to build U.S. factories.",
      "But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the AI boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines.",

      "The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There\u2019s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that\u2019s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.",
      "Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.",

      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to test the guardrails,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \u201cThe visceral initial response is, \u2018Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.\u2019 The rails are completely ineffective. They\u2019re barely there \u2014 if anything, a fig leaf.\u201d",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \u201cidentify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the company said in a statement.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,\" Ahmed said. \"And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \u201cfor a presentation\u201d or a friend.",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",

To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.",
      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really devastating,\u201d agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.",
      "At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.",
      "\u201cJust thinking about all the knowledge that\u2019s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,\" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",
      "John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.",
      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to really think about, \u2018Can I revive this research?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cCan I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?\u201d",
      "The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.",
      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",
      "Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have \u201creally gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d",
      "But Madras, who served on the President\u2019s Commission on Opioids during Trump\u2019s first term, said holding scientists\u2019 research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,\" she said. \u201cBut sacrificing science is problematic, and it\u2019s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.\u201d",
      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,\u201d Quackenbush said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.\u201d",

Interviewing a teacher for her school newspaper, Alexa discovered two students once typed something threatening about that teacher on a school computer, then deleted it. Lightspeed picked it up, and \u201cthey were taken away like five minutes later,\u201d Alexa said.",
      "Teenagers face steeper consequences than adults for what they write online, Alexa said.",
      "\u201cIf an adult makes a super racist joke that\u2019s threatening on their computer, they can delete it, and they wouldn\u2019t be arrested,\" she said.",
      "Amy Bennett, chief of staff for Lightspeed Systems, said that the software helps understaffed schools \u201cbe proactive rather than punitive\u201d by identifying early warning signs of bullying, self-harm, violence or abuse.",
      "The technology can also involve law enforcement in responses to mental health crises. In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others.",
      "\u201cA really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience \u2014 not something that helps them with their mental health care,\u201d said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Polk and West Palm Beach school districts did not provide comments.",
      "Information that could allow schools to assess the software\u2019s effectiveness, such as the rate of false alerts, is closely held by technology companies and unavailable publicly unless schools track the data themselves.",
      "Gaggle alerted more than 1,200 incidents to the Lawrence, Kansas, school district in a recent 10-month period. But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues \u2014 including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request.",
      "Students in one photography class were called to the principal\u2019s office over concerns Gaggle had detected nudity. The photos had been automatically deleted from the students\u2019 Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. District officials said they later adjusted the software's settings to reduce false alerts.",
      "Natasha Torkzaban, who graduated in 2024, said she was flagged for editing a friend\u2019s college essay because it had the words \u201cmental health.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think ideally we wouldn\u2019t stick a new and shiny solution of AI on a deep-rooted issue of teenage mental health and the suicide rates in America, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now,\u201d Torkzaban said. She was among a group of student journalists and artists at Lawrence High School who filed a lawsuit against the school system last week, alleging Gaggle subjected them to unconstitutional surveillance.",
      "School officials have said they take concerns about Gaggle seriously, but also say the technology has detected dozens of imminent threats of suicide or violence.",
      "\u201cSometimes you have to look at the trade for the greater good,\u201d said Board of Education member Anne Costello in a July 2024 board meeting.",
      "Two years after their ordeal, Mathis said her daughter is doing better, although she\u2019s still \u201cterrified\u201d of running into one of the school officers who arrested her. One bright spot, she said, was the compassion of the teachers at her daughter\u2019s alternative school. They took time every day to let the kids share their feelings and frustrations, without judgment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like we just want kids to be these little soldiers, and they\u2019re not,\u201d said Mathis. \u201cThey\u2019re just humans.\u201d",

      "Roblox, the online gaming platform wildly popular with children and teenagers, is rolling out an open-source version of an artificial intelligence system it says can help preemptively detect predatory language in game chats.",
      "The move comes as the company faces lawsuits and criticism accusing it of not doing enough to protect children from predators. For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it \u201ceasy prey for pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that \u201cno system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.\u201d",
      "The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. The company is now in the process of open-sourcing it so other platforms can use it too.",
      "Preemptively detecting possible dangers to kids can be tricky for AI systems \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 because conversations can seem innocuous at first. Questions like \u201chow old are you?\u201d or \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d wouldn't necessarily raise red flags on their own, but when put in context over the course of a longer conversation, they can take on a different meaning.",
      "Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though \u2014 as with most moderation rules \u2014 people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards.",
      "It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",

To do this, Roblox says it developed two indexes \u2014 one made up of benign messages and, the other, chats that were determined to contain child endangerment violations. Roblox says this lets the system recognize harmful patterns that go beyond simply flagging certain words or phrases, taking the entire conversation into context.",

      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",

      "\u201cAt least it lets us continue\u201d ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.",

      "That\u2019s hard to stomach when beef prices in the U.S. are rising.",
      "The U.S. first suspended cattle imports last November. Since then, more than 2,258 cases of screwworm have been identified in Mexico. Treatment requires a mix of manually removing the maggots, healing the lesions on the cows and using anti-parasite medicine.",
      "Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as \u201cmeat boutiques.\"",
      "There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. feedlots. The switch is not easy.",

      "The recent two-year drought reduced his cattle stocks and forced him to take on debt to save the small family ranch that has survived for three generations.",
      "Juan Carlos Anaya, director of Agricultural Markets Consulting Group, attributed a 2% drop in Mexico\u2019s cattle inventory last year to the drought.",

      "Scientists have solved the mystery of what killed over 5 billion sea stars \u2014 also known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America",
      "WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Sea stars \u2013 often known as starfish \u2013 typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \u201cpuffy arms sticking straight out,\u201d she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \u201cthen their arms actually fall off.\u201d",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \u201csolve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\u201d said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \u201creally smart and significant.\u201d",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \u201clook sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Gehman. \u201cThey\u2019re voracious eaters.\u201d",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations -- and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \u201cthe rainforests of the ocean.\u201d",

      "The state of Florida and President Donald Trump's administration can continue to use the facility and house detainees there, but any further construction must be halted for 14 days.",
      "While the hearing was set to resume on Tuesday, Judge Williams granted the temporary order to prevent possible harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem in the meantime.",
      "Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida urged Judge Williams to block the construction site because the detention center was completed without conducting necessary impact studies. The area is home to multiple sensitive species -- including the endangered Florida Panther -- and is considered sacred to the Miccosukee tribe.",
      "\"We welcome the court's decision to pause construction on this deeply concerning project. The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people. While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to stand for our culture, our sovereignty, and the Everglades,\" Miccosukee Chairman Talbert Cypress said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for Florida AG James Uthmeier's office released a statement to ABC News in response to the judge's ruling.",
      "\"Judge Williams' order is wrong, and we will fight it. However, it does not shut down Alligator Alcatraz, which will continue to send illegal aliens back to where they came from,\" the statement read.",
      "The judge's decision on Thursday comes after Wednesday's hearing only saw five witnesses called to the stand by the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit, instead of the multiple state and federal officials who were set to testify.",

      "Attorneys representing Florida officials have argued that the facility was initially funded by, constructed and managed by the state and is therefore exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act -- the main law being used to challenge the facility's compliance.",
      "Alligator Alcatraz has so far operated in what immigration advocates have described as a jurisdictional gray zone -- with the facility funded by the federal government but run by the state of Florida -- that they allege allows officials to skirt some legal requirements.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has previously argued that the state of Florida is \"implementing\" the federal government's immigration policy with the expectation that the state would be fully reimbursed for the costs of Alligator Alcatraz, but local and federal officials have so far been unable to tell the federal courts who is actually in charge of the facility.",
      "The hearing -- at which federal, state, and tribal officials are testifying -- comes amid heightened scrutiny of the facility, which was once touted as a \"one-stop shop to carry out President Trump's mass deportation agenda.\"",
      "Located 50 miles west of Miami in the heart of the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz was quickly constructed over a matter of weeks, utilizing hundreds of tents, trailers, and other temporary facilities to potentially house more than 3,000 detainees.",
      "The facility was built on the grounds of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, a sparsely used piece of tarmac owned by Miami-Dade County.",
      "Alligator Alcatraz also neighbors land leased to the Miccosukee Indian Tribe, including villages, a school, traditional hunting areas, and sacred sites. The Miccosukee Tribe joined the lawsuit last month, arguing that the facility threatens to damage nearby tribal villages.",

      "President Donald Trump once hailed mRNA vaccines as a \"miracle\" for combating COVID-19",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump hailed as a \u201cmedical miracle\u201d the mRNA vaccines developed to combat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.",
      "Now, his health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is effectively halting the vaccine technology\u2019s advancement. Kennedy announced Tuesday that the federal government is canceling $500 million worth of mRNA research development contracts, putting an end to U.S.-backed hopes for the vaccine technology to prevent future pandemics, treat cancer or prevent flu infections.",
      "It's a sharp pivot from how Trump and top officials described the technology during his first term.",
      "Here's a look at what Trump and some of his closest advisers have said about mRNA vaccines that were credited with slowing the pandemic five years ago.",
      "\u201cA COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life,\u201d said Redfield, in a Sept. 16, 2020, statement.",
      "Americans were still donning face masks as one of the few ways of protecting themselves from a virus that had killed nearly 200,000 in just over six months. Redfield promised that the new vaccines \u2014 developed for the first time using mRNA technology \u2014 would offer a return to normalcy.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccines ... because the vaccines were me, and I pushed people harder than they\u2019ve ever been pushed before .. The vaccines are \u2014 there are those that say it\u2019s one of the greatest things. It\u2019s a medical miracle.\u201d Trump said on Nov. 26, 2020, during a news conference in the White House.",
      "Weeks earlier, Trump had lost the election in a bitter race against Democrat Joe Biden. As the Republican grappled with leaving Washington and continued to plan for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, he reminded reporters that he oversaw the development of the new shots.",
      "\u201cThey say it\u2019s somewhat of a miracle and I think that\u2019s true,\u201d Trump said on Dec. 8, 2020, during a speech at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.",
      "The event celebrated \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\" the government-funded project that accelerated vaccine development with pharmaceutical companies. Trump was promoting the shots as the government prepared to offer them to frontline health workers.",
      "\u201cIt's clear that many Americans are learning these vaccines are safe and extraordinarily effective,\u201d Azar said on Dec. 16, 2020, at a news conference.",

Azar noted that a vast majority of Americans \u2014 between 70% to 80%, according to polls \u2014 intended to get the new COVID-19 vaccine that would be available to the public in the coming months.",
      "\u201cIt takes somewhere between five and 10 years to put a vaccine on the street. Look what we did. Now, that\u2019s because of the great work of the scientists who had done the research on mRNA vaccines and others because of industry working on this, they just didn\u2019t wake up one day and start working on it,\u201d Perna said during a podcast interview that aired on May 9, 2023.",
      "Reflecting in an interview about his time overseeing \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d Perna credited the mRNA technology with the government's ability to get shots in arms mere months after the pandemic started claiming lives in the U.S. in 2020.",
      "\u201cTake credit because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don\u2019t let them take that away from you,\u201d Trump said on Dec. 19, 2021 during a live interview with former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly.",
      "Daily COVID-19 deaths had ticked down to 1,500 compared to 3,000 from a year earlier after Americans began receiving their first doses of the mRNA vaccines.",
      "Trump revealed to O\u2019Reilly and the audience that he had just gotten a COVID-19 booster.",

      "The officers were injured by what turned out to be breaching rounds used by police to break down doors and windows that were fired by an officer acting as a gunman in the July 29 training scenario, Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis said. Both deputies are recovering.",
      "Instead of getting rounds for the training out of the heavily controlled sheriff's armory, deputies took rounds they believed were blanks from a plastic bag in a desk drawer, Lewis said.",
      "The officers followed regulations and test-fired the rounds to see if they were blanks, but fired into a berm from too far away and didn't realize they were breaching rounds, which contain gunpowder and have enough power to knock down doors at close range, the sheriff said.",
      "No criminal charges were filed but internal investigators are still reviewing what happened and the deputies involved in obtaining the ammunition could be disciplined, Lewis said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know how long those rounds were in that desk drawer. But I can assure you I don\u2019t think anybody would keep any kind of round in a baggie in a desk drawer at the Greenville County Sheriff's Office ever again,\" Lewis said at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "The two injured deputies were part of a SWAT team undergoing regular training at a vacant school building. They were practicing checking rooms for people when another officer who was supposed to be a suspect fired at them with a shotgun that was supposed to be loaded with blanks.",

      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",

      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it\u2019s not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",

      "Attorneys whose clients were not a part of the deal said in a letter Monday to U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli that the settlement was not enough because there has been no information about who it happened or who was responsible. They are asking the Department of Justice to open a probe.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "The attorneys' clients were between the ages of 12 and 17 when they were sent to camps designated for \u201cat-risk youth\u201d who had committed minor offenses, separate from the juvenile halls. Some parents were charged tuition for attendance, the attorneys said.",

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",

      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",

The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",

      "The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest had been temporarily closed since June 6 after the oddly behaving moose began staying on or around the trail near the summit. The moose, about 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder, was first spotted by the trail in May and efforts coax it away were unsuccessful.",

      "The remarks reflect the massive influence the Republican president currently has over his party. They also serve to promote two of Trump's top advisers without telegraphing the president's singular preference for a successor. Not definitively anointing Vance, or any other Republican, keeps those hoping to succeed Trump vying for his favor, both inside his administration and in the wider Republican field of possible contenders.",
      "It\u2019s early for the 2028 presidential field to begin forming, and other contenders will ultimately emerge. A challenge for anyone wading into the race, even with strong Trump connections, will be staying in the president's good graces for the duration.",

      "\u201cI think most likely, in all fairness, he\u2019s the vice president,\" Trump said. \"I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form. ... It\u2019s too early obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he\u2019s doing a great job and he would be, probably favorite at this point.\u201d",
      "When Trump selected the then-39-year-old Vance over other more established Republicans \u2014 including Rubio \u2014 as his running mate last year, many theorized that Trump was planning for the future of his political movement, angling for a vice president who could carry MAGA forward.",

      "Trump, meanwhile, has not hesitated to give Vance high-visibility assignments. As the White House promotes mid-decade redistricting efforts in Texas \u2014 and acknowledges it would like the notion to expand to other states \u2014 Vance is expected Thursday to discuss redrawing district lines with Gov. Mike Braun during a trip to Indiana. While there, Vance will also headline a fundraiser for the Republican National Committee, which he serves as treasurer.",

      "The Trump administration has reversed a decision by former President Joe Biden to approve a major wind farm development in southern Idaho",
      "SEATTLE -- The Trump administration on Wednesday canceled a major wind farm development in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden's term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management in December signed off on a scaled-down plan for the Lava Ridge Wind Project northeast of Twin Falls, with 241 wind turbines instead of 400. But the development had been on hold since the first day of President Donald Trump's second term, when he issued an executive order halting the permitting of wind power projects across the country and telling the Interior Department to review the Lava Ridge decision.",
      "\u201cBy reversing the Biden administration\u2019s thoughtless approval of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, we are protecting tens of thousands of acres from harmful wind policy while shielding the interests of rural Idaho communities,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. \"This decisive action defends the American taxpayer, safeguards our land, and averts what would have been one of the largest, most irresponsible wind projects in the nation.\u201d",
      "The project, five years in the works, faced opposition from local residents concerned about the height of the turbines \u2014 up to 660 feet (201 meters), or more than twice the height of the Statue of Liberty. It also drew concerns it would spoil views from the Minidoka National Historic Site, where thousands of Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II.",
      "Under the plan, the closest turbine to the historic site would have been 9 miles (14 kilometers) away.",
      "Robyn Achilles, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Minidoka, said in a text message her organization was reviewing the announcement.",
      "\u201cWe must protect Minidoka from future development, so we continue to seek long term protections for the BLM land in Minidoka's cultural viewshed,\u201d Achilles wrote.",
      "The Interior Department's statement rescinding Lava Ridge's approval did not mention Minidoka. A spokeswoman for the company that proposed the development, Magic Valley Energy, did not immediately return messages seeking comment.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management said when it approved the project that it could power up to 500,000 homes and that its decision reflected \"a careful balance of clean energy development with the protection of natural, cultural, and socioeconomic resources on this historically significant landscape.\u201d",
      "Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation. New wind farms cost less to build and operate than new natural gas plants on average in most regions of the United States, even without tax credits.",
      "The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have targeted wind and solar projects as expensive and unreliable while taking steps to support the burning of fossil fuels, which is dangerously heating the planet.",

      "The tax-and-spending legislation signed by Trump last month phases out tax credits and other subsidies for clean energy, and an executive order issued by Trump a few days later further restricts subsidies for what he calls \u201cthe Green New Scam.\u201d",
      "Since then, Burgum has issued a series of memos targeting wind and solar power, including a July 17 memo that requires his personal approval of all solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters. The order authorizes Burgum to conduct \u201celevated review\u201d of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.",
      "The restrictions on clean-energy projects are aimed at \u201cending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,\u201d the Interior Department said in a statement.",
      "Late last month, Burgum canceled plans to use millions of acres of federal waters for new offshore wind development.",
      "And earlier this week, he issued a new secretarial order requiring that Interior agencies evaluating new wind and solar consider \u201ccapacity density,\u201d or how much area the projects cover. Commercial-scale solar and wind projects typically require a much greater amount of land and water than other energy sources such as oil and natural gas.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t oversight,\" said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable industry. \"It\u2019s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power.\u201d",

      "Coristine was assaulted around 3 a.m. Sunday in the city\u2019s Logan Circle neighborhood by a group of teenagers attempting to carjack him and a woman whom police identified as his significant other, according to authorities.",
      "The Metropolitan Police Department said the group approached the couple\u2019s car and made a comment about taking it. Coristine pushed the woman into the vehicle for safety and turned to confront the group. At least several of the teens then attacked him, police said, until officers patrolling nearby intervened. As officers moved toward the group, the teens fled on foot.",
      "Two 15-year-olds from Maryland were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking, police said.",
      "The attack gave new fuel to long-standing Republican efforts to challenge Washington\u2019s autonomy, with Trump threatening to bypass local authority and impose direct federal control over the city.",
      "In a social media post and remarks at the White House on Tuesday, the president described crime in Washington as \u201cout of control.\"",

      "Still, local officials have acknowledged in recent years that youth crime, particularly carjackings, remains a serious concern. Just last year, a 14-year-old was charged with killing a Lyft driver in a botched carjacking, and a significant portion of carjacking arrests in Washington involve juveniles.",

    "summary": "Florida Power & Light is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years.",
    "story": [
      "Florida's biggest utility company is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years, which environmental advocates say would represent the largest utility hike in U.S. history.",
      "Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of Florida-based energy company NextEra Energy, outlined the changes in a petition filed in February with the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's electric industry. According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by approximately $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",
      "In her\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0testimony for the company, FPL senior director of financial forecasting Ina Laney said Lawton's analysis was \"fundamentally flawed and misleading,\" and that it \"fails to recognize the significant customer benefits derived from FPL's financial strategy.\"",
      "Added Laney, \"FPL consistently achieves industry-leading performance in service reliability and cost management.\"",

      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\"",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated.",
      "The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.",
      "Mr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts.",
      "The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority.",
      "Even people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\"",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",
      "As of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously.",
      "\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "To determine the most commonly swiped vehicles, the HLDI analyzed stolen vehicle data for 2022-2024 car models between the years of 2021 to 2024. Their analysis hit upon a few shared traits between many of the cars favored by auto thieves.",
      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",

      "\"This body control module software enhancement involves an important security update for certain model year 2020 to 2024 Chevrolet Camaros,\" a GM spokesman said in a statement to auto blog GM Authority. \"GM counters vehicle theft methods as they evolve.

    "story": [
      "A Federal Reserve official on Wednesday called last week's\u00a0tepid jobs report \"concerning,\" and said its significant downward revisions could signal an economic shift in the U.S.",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook highlighted the report's sizable downward revisions to jobs created in May and June, saying that they are \"typical of turning points\" in the economy.",
      "Friday's report showed that employers added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, also sharply revised its job estimates for May and June, saying that the U.S. added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.",
      "After Friday's report, President Trump fired the BLS commissioner of labor statistics, claiming that the revisions undermined the data's accuracy. He added that \"Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP'.\"",
      "Revisions are a common feature of the monthly jobs reports from the BLS, which updates its data after receiving new information from businesses and other sources. Some economists said the July jobs report reflected that some companies are scaling back hiring plans amid a slowing U.S. economy and uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"There were two major revisions to May and June, and these revisions are somewhat typical of turning points, which again speak to uncertainty,\" Cook said during a Wednesday\u00a0discussion with other Fed officials on the global economic outlook.",
      "She later added, \"When we get the GDP numbers later this year, we're going to see, I can imagine, lower activity.\"",
      "Crafting effective economic policies is dependent on understanding where the economy is heading, said Cook, who prior to her appointment in 2022 as a Fed governor was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, according to her biography.",
      "\"We want to know not just where we've been, but where we're going. So if we're at an inflection point, we want to look at data that speak to inflection points,\" she added.",
      "Other Fed officials said the July jobs report may not necessarily reflect a long-term direction. On Friday, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he had questions about whether the report was a one-time issue or a trend, and added that he believes the labor market still has \"a lot of strength.\"",
      "The downward revision to May and June's hiring data marked the largest two-month downward revision outside of a recession since 1968, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.",
      "Cook also discussed what she referred to as an \"uncertainty tax\" that she said is weighing on businesses across industries. She said that executives at \"all kinds of organizations\" are spending more time on preparing for and responding to macroeconomic uncertainty. That includes discussions about pricing based on anticipated cost increases from the new tariffs.",
      "When executives spend their time this way, it's a \"deadweight loss, we're not going to see that in GDP,\" she explained.",
      "\"So there's just uncertainty across the board, but I think it's really interesting that no matter what the sector, no matter what kind of businesses they're in, they're talking about the uncertainty tax,\" Cook said.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "summary": "President Trump said two major banks turned down his business. Here's why conservatives are concerned with so-called debanking.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday claimed that major banks are discriminating against conservatives \u2014 including him \u2014 through the act of debanking, or when financial institutions refuse to work with some individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment in an\u00a0interview with CNBC on Tuesday, after he was asked about a report\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal that said he would soon sign an executive order aimed at stamping out debanking. Mr. Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase gave him 20 days to close his account, although he didn't specify when this occurred or what reason he was given by the bank for doing so. He also claimed that Bank of America refused his business after he left JPMorgan.",
      "The issue of debanking has become a sticking point for some conservatives who claim that they've been unfairly targeted by financial institutions. Debanking can occur for a number of reasons, such as if a financial institution detects potentially fraudulent activity or the account owner is overdrawn, but some conservatives claim they have been rejected due to their political views.",
      "\"They discriminated against many conservatives,\" the president told CNBC.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan rejected such allegations of bias against conservatives, in a recent interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that took place ahead of Mr. Trump's comments on CNBC. Moynihan pointed to the nation's second-largest bank's massive customer base as evidence of its diverse clientele. He also emphasized the impact of federal regulations, in addition to concerns over legal and financial risk, on banking decisions.",
      "\"We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not \u2014 the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought,\" the CEO told Margaret Brennan. \"So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.\"",
      "At a\u00a0Senate hearing\u00a0in February over the issue, Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said debanking harms individuals as well as the economy, and violates the principles of fair market access. Debanking has also been highlighted by some crypto investors, such the CEO of crypto platform Anchorage Digital, who\u00a0testified\u00a0in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "The White House declined to comment on the EO.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, adding that it agrees with Mr. Trump that \"regulatory change is desperately needed.\" It added, \"We're pleased to see the White House is addressing this issue, for which we've been advocating for many years, and look forward to working with them to get this right.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Bank of America said, \"Political beliefs are not a factor in account closure decisions.\" Referring to the reported EO, the bank said in a statement that it welcomes \"regulatory clarity\" from the Trump administration.",
      "Reached for comment on Mr. Trump's recent comments, Bank of America pointed to its earlier statement.",
      "What happens when someone is debanked?",
      "Debanking isn't just happening at banks, said Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.",
      "\"This can be something that happens to you at a credit union, at a cryptocurrency exchange or anywhere else really,\" Anthony said. \"It's just having that sudden abrupt closure of your financial account where you've been, and essentially kicked out of the system or cut off from the system.\"",
      "Banks are not required by law to give account owners a reason for why their account is being closed. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks are obligated to track their customers' activity and file a so-called suspicious activity report (or SAR) if they notice anything unusual. Banks aren't allowed to disclose to customers if there's a SAR, which can leave some people in the dark if their account is shut for this reason.",
      "\"It's a terrible feeling to suddenly have this relationship cut off, and you really don't know why,\" Anthony said. \"In a lot of cases, it's by federal law that banks can't tell you what happened, and you're kind of left to just spiral there.\"",
      "How many people are impacted by debanking?",
      "More than 8,000 consumers filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the last three years related to their financial institutions' \"improperly closing checking, savings or other deposit accounts,\" according to a February analysis from the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.",
      "By comparison, consumers made about 1.3 million complaints about credit reporting in 2023 alone, according to CFPB data.",
      "Why do banks close accounts?",
      "Banks can close accounts if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious behavior, or if a customer violates their terms. In the complaints cited by the Senate banking committee analysis, some consumers said they had faced overdraft fees due to overdrawn funds before their banks shuttered their accounts, for example.",
      "But there's no data that tracks whether people or institutions are debanked due to their political views, although there are anecdotal accounts, experts said.",
      "\"There is no actual data or proof that conservatives are being debanked for their beliefs,\" Jeremy Siegel, senior associate at research firm Pleiades Strategy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In fact, Florida set up a hotline for this very reason, and got zero complaints. A Virginia Credit League Lobbyist said this in his testimony against a similar bill in Virginia.\"",
      "Banks set risk tolerances and conduct their business within those perimeters, added Shayna Olesiuk, director of banking policy at Better Markets, a financial advocacy group.",
      "\"They must always understand and manage any risk that they are accepting in their business activities and decisions; this could include things like financial risk or unlawful or discriminatory activity,\" she added.",
      "What about political views and debanking?",
      "There have been allegations from some conservatives that their political views led to account closures. The attorney general for Kansas, Kris W. Kobach, sent a\u00a0letter to Bank of America last year, alleging discrimination by the bank of religious groups he states had their accounts closed without explanation.",
      "Banking policies appear \"to be systematically punishing religious and political views with which it disagrees,\" the Kobach claimed in the letter.",
      "But some of these organizations had red flags that could have led to the debanking, such running a debt collection business outside of the U.S., Cato's Anthony added.",
      "\"There are anecdotal cases of conservative account holders that have had their accounts closed, but at the same time, we see that with others as well,\" he added. \"There's been a longstanding history of people who are Muslim having their accounts denied, people with Russian last names or Middle Eastern last names for that matter, having their accounts denied.\"",
      "\"It seems to be a widespread issue in the sense that it affects all different sorts of people,\" Anthony said.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

      "Women have made significant gains in the workplace over the past two decades, but one segment of female workers has been left behind: those without a college degree.",
      "New research shows a growing divide in progress in the workforce between women who have earned at least a bachelor's degree and those without any higher education.",
      "The share of college-educated women in the workforce increased by nine percentage points between 2004 and 2024, research from Third Way, a think tank advocating for moderate policy, shows. Meanwhile, women without a college degree barely notched gains: The share of noncollege women in the workforce increased by less than a percentage point over the same period, according to the report.",
      "\"This divergence in the labor force experience of women with and without college degrees speaks to changes in recent years in the workplace, and around the culture of work,\" Curran McSwigan, Third Way's deputy director of economics and author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those changes are weighted toward women with degrees.\"",
      "Flex work",
      "For example, flexible work arrangements are now more common across corporations, allowing some workers to do their jobs from home, at least part of the time, and better balance work with caregiving duties.",
      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",
      "\"It's not one-size-fits-all approach,\" McSwigan said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",

    "story": [
      "Friday's disappointing July employment report\u00a0delivered a reality check on the U.S. economy, with the data suggesting the job market is wobbling from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs.",
      "What was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.",
      "The latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks\u00a0to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\"\u00a0\u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

      "Americans could see inflation tick higher in 2025 as businesses start to pass on the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers through price hikes, Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview.",
      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "\"What I'm focused on is making sure that we have an economy that's working for all Americans,\" Hammack said. \"Which is why I believe we need to stay really focused on the inflation side of our mandate.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next decision on interest rates in September, and some analysts are already calling for a rate cut with the US economy seeing three straight months of weak jobs growth. Hammack admits waiting too long to cut rates because of potential inflation is a risk.",
      "\"If we wait too long to cut rates, that could mean that more people are losing their jobs than we'd like to see,\" Hammack said. \"We have to balance those two factors when we're trying to decide what's right to steer the economy forward.",

      "The award comes just six months after a Delaware judge ordered the company to revoke his\u00a0$56 billion pay package\u00a0from 2018.",
      "Musk appealed the order in March. A month later, Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was\u00a0creating\u00a0a special committee to look at Musk's compensation as CEO. Creating this new compensation will ensure Musk stays as CEO of Tesla for next several years and alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.",
      "\"We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. The grant will motivate Musk to lead the company through an \"inflection point,\" as Tesla transitions to an AI-first company, he added.",
      "Equal to 2018 pay package",
      "The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO.",
      "After that pay package was initially approved, a Tesla stockholder challenged it in a lawsuit, leading to a legal showdown.",
      "In a December ruling 2024 ruling, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed an earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in\u00a0sham negotiations\u00a0with directors who were not independent.",
      "At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive\u00a0fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "According to the regulatory filing, if the Delaware courts reinstate Musk's 2018 pay package, the $29 billion award would be \"immediately forfeited and returned to the Company.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "When Mr. Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",
      "After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.",
      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",

    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",

      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",

    "story": [
      "An attempted carjacking that injured a DOGE staff member in Washington, D.C., prompted President Trump to once again push for a federal takeover of the city's government.",
      "\"If D.C. doesn't get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City.\"",
      "The episode reignited Mr. Trump's long-running call to take control of the city, citing violent crime and what he described as incompetent leadership. He made the case in February and July of this year, as well as on the campaign trail.",
      "\"We have to run D.C.,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"This has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst.\"",
      "However, the president alone does not have the authority to federalize the district. It would require an act of Congress to overturn the 1973 Home Rule Act, which gave D.C. residents the power to elect the council members and mayor who pass and implement their local laws.",
      "Congress retains the authority to amend or block D.C. laws, and did so in 2023 when it\u00a0nullified a crime bill that would have eliminated most mandatory minimum sentences.",
      "Before the Home Rule Act, the president could appoint D.C. leaders. Some Republican members of Congress have introduced legislation that could restore that power, but any repeal would require the support of Senate Democrats, which is unlikely.",
      "Mr. Trump also floated other options on Wednesday, including taking over the D.C. police or bringing in the National Guard.",
      "Under the Home Rule Act, the president can take over D.C.'s police department for a period of time if \"special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\" But legal experts have said such a move could face court challenges without clear justification.",

      "\"And what a shame, the rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday.",
      "Data from the D.C. police shows there have been 186 carjacking incidents so far this year, but that's down 37% from this time in 2024.",
      "Violent crime has also been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023, when the nation's capitol was among the deadliest of the large metro areas in the country.",
      "So far in 2025, robberies have dropped by 29%, homicides are down 12%, and overall violent crime is down 26% as of August 6. That follows declines in 2024, when violent crime in D.C. hit a 30-year low, mirroring a broader nationwide drop in violent crime last year.",
      "Crime is not the only local issue Mr. Trump took issue with on Wednesday. The president also said he wanted to improve the \"cleanliness\" of the district.",
      "This comes after the president signed an executive order in March, establishing a task force to address what the administration called \"quality of life\" issues in D.C., including homelessness and graffiti.",
      "Trump's history with D.C. officials",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has not commented on Mr. Trump's latest remarks. During his first term, the president clashed with the Democratic mayor over the handling of protests and public safety.",
      "In 2020, Bowser ordered the painting of a Black Lives Matter mural on a street a few blocks from the White House, as Mr. Trump faced backlash for his response to protests over the murder of George Floyd by police. Earlier this year, Bowser approved plans to remove the mural.",
      "Mayor Bowser and other Democrats have long pushed for statehood to give D.C.'s 700,000\u00a0residents congressional representation \u2014 something that would require legislative and presidential approval. Efforts to make D.C. the 51st state have faced Republican opposition and failed in Congress.",

      "CBS News has reached out to the Commerce Department for comment on Mr. Trump's post.",
      "Here's what to know about the census process:",
      "The Constitution requires the Census be taken every 10 years",
      "Per Article I, Section 2: \"The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.\" Congress codified the decennial census into law in 1954. The Constitution also mandates that reapportionment (the designation of how many Congressional seats a state gets) happens every 10 years, in line with the Census. Redistricting then uses that apportionment and then states are supposed to redraw lines every 10 years, when they know how many Congressional seats they will have for the decade.",
      "The actual data collection for the 2030 Census is supposed to start in ... 2030",
      "It's a long process to design the Census process, send out the Census forms and then have enumerators physically go out to collect the rest of the data for people who don't mail their form back or fill it out online. The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in\u00a02019. But the actual surveys and collection of data at a large scale begins on Census Day, April 1 of each decade year. Currently, the\u00a0bureau's timeline\u00a0has them in the \"Development and Integration Phase\" which includes more design planning, and small-scale field tests.",
      "Citizenship question in the Census?",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but that was\u00a0rejected in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. But that decision kept the door open to including that question in the future, but concluded that the reason given by the administration and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was \"contrived\" and \"pretextual.\" Because of a tight timeline for when Census forms had to be finalized in 2019, the Trump administration didn't have time to appeal and find another avenue to get the citizenship question on the Census. With Census collection for 2030 still years away, there's a longer runway to legally try and get a citizenship question on the form.",
      "The Census Bureau does take annual surveys/data gathering, but not for population count that would impact redistricting",
      "Since 2005, the Bureau conducts the \"American Community Survey\" every year to collect social, economic, housing and demographic information from a\u00a0sample\u00a0of households in all 50 states.\u00a0This\u00a0survey does ask about place of birth, citizenship and year of entry into the U.S. But the Bureau maintains that the data remains anonymous.",
      "\"No one is able to figure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce,\" the Census website\u00a0states.",
      "Is political party collected in the Census?",
      "No. There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election. But the decennial Census does not ask about political party, income or religion.",
      "Black, Latino and Indigenous populations were undercounted in the 2020 census",
      "The Bureau and experts cited delays caused by COVID-19 and a chilling effect by Mr. Trump's attempt to introduce a citizenship question on the Census form, as the reason for the undercount. Latinos saw about a 5% undercount in 2020, compared to 1.54% in the 2010 Census. The undercount rate for the Black population was 3.3% in 2020, compared to 2% in 2010. Overall, the Census Bureau's post-enumeration survey found that there was a net coverage undercount of 0.25% or 782,000 for the nation.",
      "How do Congressional seats work with the Census?",
      "In 1911, Congress set the number of seats at 435, a number which was permanently set by the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. The number of seats each state gets is determined by population, with a minimum of one. California has the most with 52, followed by Texas with 38 and Florida with 28.",
      "Given population changes, the number of Congressional seats each state gets is determined by the census. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in July suggested that the census should be redone since he believed Florida should have gotten two new seats instead of just one.",
      "Based off the number of seats each state receives, the Congressional districts are then set, either by the state legislature or an independent commission. Mr. Trump is currently locked in a redistricting battle in Texas, where he has instructed the state's Republicans to redraw the districts to give the GOP an advantage in up to five more seats.",
      "The very public battle in Texas has led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom saying he too could redraw the map for Democrats, and has also led several other states to start looking at creating new districts for partisan advantage.",

But talks aimed at cementing the deal have\u00a0stalled in the months since, with negotiations in Abu Dhabi in July failing to lead to a breakthrough.",
      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff traveled to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, in March. Aryeh Lightstone, former CEO of the Abraham Accords Peace Institute, has made multiple trips to the region as part of peace deal talks. The Trump administration has said an Azerbaijan peace deal with its neighbor is necessary before it can join the Abraham Accords, as part of a plan to expand that agreement beyond the Arab countries that signed up to it in 2020 when they recognized Israel.",

    "summary": "A group of Democrats in Congress is seeking to stop Department of Government Efficiency employees from moving into permanent positions in the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of Democrats in Congress is seeking to stop Department of Government Efficiency employees from moving into permanent positions in the federal government, penning a letter asking for more information on DOGE's presence within agencies after Elon Musk's exit earlier this year.",
      "\"Although Elon Musk has departed, his influence remains, as DOGE and its employees attempt to become a permanent part of the federal government, scattered across agencies where they can continue to sabotage key functions from within,\" Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, along with Rep. Robert Garcia of California, wrote in a letter late Wednesday.",
      "Writing to Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, the Democratic senators and ranking member on the House Oversight Committee sought more information on how DOGE has embedded itself in the federal government.",
      "The lawmakers called DOGE's continued presence in federal agencies \"alarming,\" outlining in the letter, obtained exclusively by CBS News, that \"employees are embedding themselves in the federal government in key agency positions\" which they argue threatens the government's ability \"to serve the American people,\" while alluding to potential violations of civil service laws.",
      "Kupor refuted the lawmakers' characterization of the civil service hiring process in a statement to CBS News, saying OPM \"reviews all requests to appoint current or recent political appointees to career roles for compliance with merit systems principles and civil service laws,\" while noting that \"all federal hires undergo required background checks, ethics reviews, and suitability screenings.\"",
      "\"No DOGE-affiliated individuals have 'unlawfully burrowed' into career roles,\" Kupor said. \"We welcome oversight grounded in facts.\"",
      "The Democrats' request comes as DOGE's presence in Washington has changed shape since Musk left his role as a \"special government employee\" in late May, when he reached the maximum amount of time he could serve in the position. President Trump thanked Musk \"and all of his people\" at the time, saying, \"almost all of them are staying, and they're going to be with us. And you're going to see the results coming long into the future.\"",
      "Musk pledged upon his departure that \"this is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "The Tesla CEO began the cost-cutting effort in January and had initially pledged to cut $2 trillion of government spending, but later lowered the benchmark to $1 trillion. At the time of Musk's departure, the White House said DOGE's efforts saved roughly $170 billion in spending. But that figure has been disputed, with a number of errors and miscalculations on the initiative's \"wall of receipts.\"",
      "Since Musk left the role, DOGE has continued to post about its cost cutting. A recent review by CBS News found that the claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated. Still, Musk pledged when he left the job that DOGE is \"like a way of life\" and would be \"permeating throughout the government\" to secure $1 trillion in savings \"over time.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Vought outlined at a House Appropriations Committee hearing in June that the vision for DOGE going forward would be \"far more institutionalized at the actual agency,\" saying many DOGE employees are functioning \"almost as in-house consultants as a part of the agency's leadership.\" The leadership of DOGE, Vought said, is \"now much more decentralized.\"",
      "For some, questions have remained about how the effort would continue to shape government agencies. Writing to Vought and Kupor, the Democratic lawmakers sought answers to a number of questions, including who currently leads DOGE and queries about the presence of DOGE employees within the federal government more broadly.",
      "The lawmakers said that converting DOGE appointees to career federal service roles could \"potentially run afoul of laws that explicitly ban political considerations and loyalty tests in hiring practices,\" adding that \"it is unclear who newly embedded DOGE staff are accountable to and if they truly serve within the chain of command of the agencies they work for.\" They urged OPM to enforce civil service regulations \"that prohibit political patronage in government hiring.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The fight for control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections is underway \u2014 long before a single ballot is cast next year.",
      "Texas is fighting to enact a GOP-led redistricting effort that would give Republicans five more seats in the state and help them hold their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. But it isn't the only state where redistricting pushes are underway, as California and other states consider similar moves ahead of the midterms.",
      "Typically, states redraw congressional and legislative districts after the decennial census to reflect population shifts. Texas undertook its redistricting effort after President Trump suggested in mid-July the state should redraw for Republican advantage. About a week earlier, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, had written to the Texas governor and state attorney general to complain that four of the state's current districts were \"coalition districts\" \u2014 that is, districts with different racial groups that support the same candidate \u2014 that were \"not protected by the Voting Rights Act.\"",
      "She referred to the districts as \"vestiges of an unconstitutional racially based gerrymandering past, which must be abandoned, and must now be corrected by Texas.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, asked about redistricting on CNBC this week, said, \"they did it to us,\" blaming Democratic-led states for the unusual mid-decade redistricting push.",
      "\"California is gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress in California \u2014 it's all gerrymandered,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And we have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats.\"",
      "Eight states rely on independent commissions to craft new maps, which in most cases means they won't be joining the gerrymandering battle that's underway. But in at least two of those states, New York and California, Democratic governors are looking for ways to get around that requirement in order to bolster their congressional delegations' majorities.",
      "In other states, congressional delegations already heavily skew toward one party, limiting the number of gains that can be made. Maryland's eight-member delegation has just one Republican, and in Illinois, Democrats control 14 of the 17 House seats.",
      "Looming over the redistricting efforts is a case before the Supreme Court that could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and attempts to remedy alleged vote dilution. The dispute involves Louisiana's congressional map, and while the high court heard arguments in March, it set the case for re-argument in its next term, which starts in October.",
      "The long-running court fight began after the state's GOP-led legislature adopted a map with one majority-minority district, but was ordered to add a second majority-Black district by a federal judge who said the original map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Louisiana's map now includes two majority-Black districts out of its six House seats.",
      "The high court asked the parties Friday to file new papers on whether the intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates the Constitution's 14th Amendment \u2014 an indication that the court will be weighing whether race-based redistricting is lawful.",

      "Texas Republicans unveiled their proposed map last week, which meets the president's goal of five additional GOP-leaning districts. Under the new map, if enacted, Republicans could win up to 30 of the state's 38 House districts.",
      "A state House panel voted Saturday to advance the redrawn map in a party-line vote.",
      "In response to the redistricting bid, dozens of Democratic state lawmakers fled Texas for Chicago and New York in an effort to deny Republicans a quorum Monday and block them from adopting the new map.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said he would seek to strip the absent Democrats of their membership in the Texas state House, and GOP state lawmakers approved a motion Monday for the Texas House sergeant-at-arms to secure the attendance of missing Democrats \"under warrant of arrest if necessary.\" Abbott on Tuesday filed a lawsuit to the Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office if he did not return by Thursday.",

Gavin Newsom has said that he would push for a multi-step plan that would allow the lines of the House districts to be drawn by the state legislature \u2014 and in the middle of the decade.",
      "Under the proposal, the governor would call a special election for early November to have voters approve the new congressional map.",
      "Newsom suggested Monday that there were drafts of new maps in progress and said his team helped initiate conversations with Democratic leadership. The re-crafted map could increase the seats Democrats hold by five, according to the Associated Press.",
      "\"The maps, we believe should be transparent, they should be provided in a transparent way to the public, and as a consequence, those maps are being processed and will be brought to light,\" he said.",
      "He added, \"The ultimate determination will be by the people of the state of California. We will offer them the opportunity to make judgment for themselves \u2014 again, only if Texas moves forward. We would maintain the framework of the independent redistricting commission that I support, that I believe in. We would just allow for this mid-census redistricting to occur just for congressional maps in 26, 28 and 30.\"",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, and Democrats hold 43 of those seats.",
      "Indiana",

      "Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan's seat in the northwest corner of the state, bordering parts of Chicago's suburbs, could be a target as Republicans consider an effort to redraw the state's congressional maps, which could leave Democrats with a single seat in the state. The Indiana Legislature, overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans, is tasked with drawing its congressional districts.",
      "New York",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have suggested that the Democratic-controlled legislature could create new congressional maps that are more friendly to Democrats.",
      "\"We're sick and tired of being pushed around when other states don't have the same aspirations that we always have had, and I hold those dear, but I cannot ignore that,\" Hochul said at a press conference with some Texas Democratic lawmakers earlier this week. \"This the playing field has changed dramatically, and shame on us if we ignore that fact and cling tight to the vestiges of the past. That era is over. Donald Trump eliminated that. Forever.\"",
      "But New York faces some steep obstacles in trying to redraw the maps before the midterms. New York's constitution calls for a bipartisan commission to draw up the congressional maps, although the state Assembly and Senate get final approval. In the 2021 redistricting, New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, said Democrats had \"unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts\" and ordered a special master to redraw the district.",
      "With the help of these maps, Republicans were able to flip four seats in New York in the 2022 elections, making the congressional delegation 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans. Democrats sued, and in a 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals said those maps were supposed to be temporary and ordered an independent commission to redraw the maps. The new districts gave Democrats a slight edge. With these maps, Democrats flipped four seats in 2024, giving them 19 seats in the state and Republicans seven.",
      "If Democrats wanted to lead an effort to change New York's constitution, it would require an affirmative vote in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature, and then it would have to be approved by voters, as Hochul herself noted on Monday. The 2025 legislative session is already over, with the next session starting in January 2026.",
      "\"This could be really more on the ballot in the fall of '27 and be enacted in time for the congressional races in 2028 as well as the presidential \u2014 so, it is not the timeline that I would have preferred, but it does shave off four years from another through the process,\" Hochul said Monday. \"But we're going to also look at litigation strategies. We're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "The state constitution also prohibits mid-decade redistricting, and any new proposal to amend it to allow a redrawing of state lines before the next census would have to clear the current state legislature and the one elected in 2026.",
      "\"The earliest that could go into effect would be after the 2027 elections, preventing the state from re-redistricting until the 2028 election cycle,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and professor at New York Law School.",
      "Following Hochul's suggestion that the state's redistricting commission be disbanded, Wice said it's not a surprise that some are calling for it to be scrapped after the panel failed to complete its work in 2022 \u2014 until a court stepped in.",
      "\"A state legislature can draw a responsibly developed map if it follows objective and prioritized criteria and works in an open and transparent manner, inviting public participation and review,\" he said.",
      "Missouri",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Missouri, and the Legislature is tasked with drawing its congressional districts. State lawmakers approved a congressional redistricting plan in 2022, after which Republicans won six of Missouri's eight congressional seats.",
      "But some state lawmakers want to extend the GOP's hold on the congressional map to 7-1. State party leaders may target the 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Although Cleaver won by over 23 points in 2024, Republicans in neighboring districts each won by more than 40 points.",
      "The only time Missouri has engaged in mid-decade redistricting was in the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled each district had to be nearly equal in population, and a new Senatorial Appointment Commission was established to redraw the Congressional districts for the 1966 election.",
      "State Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin told Columbia's KSSZ 93.9 last week that it is \"likely\" the Legislature would be called in for a special session by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. He told St. Louis' Fox affiliate over the weekend that he supported the idea, saying \"is Missouri represented properly in Washington, D.C., and, quite frankly, what can we do to support President Trump's agenda?\"",
      "Lt. Gov. David Wasinger also indicated support for redrawing the congressional map, noting in a statement that Missouri is a \"solidly conservative state.\"",
      "\"Despite this, our current congressional map still sends two progressive Democrats to push a liberal agenda in D.C., misrepresenting the will of Missouri voters,\" he said in a statement. \"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them.\"",
      "The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a coalition of conservative state lawmakers, has also been urging Kehoe, a Republican, to convene a special session of the state General Assembly to redraw its congressional map \"consistent with President Trump's recommendation.\"",
      "\"The most current congressional map that was passed was a weak compromise \u2014 inconsistent with the political will of Missouri voters,\" the Missouri Freedom Caucus said in a statement last week. \"It's time this super-majority Republican party in Missouri grows a spine and actually delivers the congressional map that reflects the strong conservative values of this great state, as the political makeup of this state clearly demands.\"",
      "Florida",
      "In Florida, the congressional maps are created by the Legislature and approved by the governor.",
      "Florida Republicans have 20 seats in the U.S. House, with Democrats holding just eight. Although Democrats had challenged the current maps in court, the Florida Supreme Court in July upheld the elimination of a majority Black district.",
      "Despite that victory, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that he was \"seriously\" looking at asking the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the maps.",
      "DeSantis has also criticizedlong insisted that he felt the 2020 Census was flawed and Florida should have gained two cCongressional seats, rather than one.",
      "\"I do think we are going to be looking at the pathways to be able do the redistricting here in Florida,\" DeSantis said on July 30.",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Florida state government, controlling the governor's mansion and both chambers of the Legislature. It would be difficult for Florida Democrats to break quorum because a simple majority is only needed for a quorum in Tallahassee, and Democrats are a superminority.",

    "summary": "The renowned research hospital that cares for people with rare or life-threatening diseases has been pummeled by an employee exodus and the gutting of research, both driven by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The number of people receiving treatment at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center \u2014 the renowned research hospital that cares for patients with rare or life-threatening diseases \u2014 has tumbled under the second Trump administration, according to government documents and interviews with current and former NIH employees.",
      "NIH documents viewed by KFF Health News show a pronounced decline in patients at the 200-bed hospital from February through April, a time that coincides with the Department of Health and Human Services' mass firings of government employees, the gutting of scientific research, and the administration's broad crackdown on immigration. The average number of patients being treated daily during that time hovered between 60 and 80, with the April numbers falling to the lower end of that range. By contrast, in October, about 80 patients per day on average were at the hospital.",
      "The number of cancer clinical trial participants at the hospital as of July was down about 20% from last year, one NIH cancer scientist said. KFF Health News agreed not to identify the scientist and others who participated in this article who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The numbers \"really don't look too good,\" Pius Aiyelawo, acting CEO of the clinical center, said during a May 23 meeting of the NIH Clinical Center Research Hospital Board.",
      "As of April 30, the average number of patients in the hospital per day had declined by 5.7% compared with the same period a year ago.",
      "Adults and children with cancer, people who need bone marrow transplants, and people with rare diseases or infections are among the patients who receive care at no charge at the NIH hospital, according to former officials. Clinicians there provide potentially lifesaving treatments as part of clinical trials, often to people who have run out of options.",
      "Research at the hospital has also led to breakthroughs about cancer, traumatic brain injury, and AIDS, among other ailments. James Gilman, a physician who was CEO of the clinical center from 2017 until retiring in January, said the center has driven important advances against disease \"that couldn't have happened anywhere else.\"",
      "Former officials said the drop in patients this year is a consequence of the upheaval the Trump administration has caused at the NIH, the world's largest public funder of scientific research.",
      "Current and former employees say an exodus of clinicians, scientists, and other staffers has limited how many patients can be treated. Morale has tanked because of widespread firings and the administration's cancellation of grants that funded research into health disparities, vaccines, the health of LGBTQ+ people, and more. Contracts have been cut, and scientists have seen delays in getting essential supplies for clinical research.",
      "\"Every day seems to be some type of breaking point,\" one NIH worker said.",
      "During the May board meeting, a video of which KFF Health News viewed, Aiyelawo attributed the decrease in patients coming to the hospital to the departure of NIH investigators \u2014 the researchers on studies \u2014 and less patient recruitment. He also noted 11 recent departures of clinical center staffers. They included Christine Grady, a nurse who led the center's bioethics department and the wife of Anthony Fauci, the former head of the NIH's infectious diseases institute who became a lightning rod for conservatives during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "HHS has fired more than 1,200 NIH employees this year as part of its purge of the federal workforce, but the true number of departures is almost certainly higher. Others have opted for early retirement or quit because they opposed the Trump administration's orders.",
      "Gilman said the NIH hospital relies on a \"very complex ecosystem and network to find patients who are not too sick\" to potentially be enrolled in a clinical trial. When researchers leave, \"those patients are lost,\" he said.",
      "The clinical center's 2025 annual report said there were roughly 1,500 research studies underway in 2024, including studies focused on cancer, infectious disease, heart and lung conditions, and blood disorders. Clinical trials accounted for about half.",
      "The National Cancer Institute \u2014 which is the largest of the NIH's 27 institutes and has been crippled by cuts and chaos this year \u2014 typically has the most patients needing inpatient care, Gilman said.",
      "\"What has happened here since January has been a pretty traumatic time for that ecosystem,\" he said, \"and there are pieces of it that will take a long time to rebuild, if indeed they get a chance to rebuild.\"",
      "During the May board meeting, Aiyelawo said NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya \"is very aware\" that fewer people are getting treated at the hospital \"and we're doing everything we can to be able to get those numbers up.\"",
      "The drop in patients this year isn't isolated to people needing inpatient care, NIH documents show. As of the end of April, outpatient visits were down 8.5% compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year. The number of new patients overall had declined by 6.7%, to about 3,370 people.",
      "In response to questions, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote in an emailed statement that the clinical center \"remains fully operational and continues to provide world-class clinical research and patient care. Every day, patients from across the country and around the globe come here to participate in cutting-edge studies that drive scientific discovery and improve health outcomes.\"",
      "\"As the crown jewel of research and discovery, the Clinical Center is a top priority\" under Bhattacharya's leadership, Nixon said. \"We are committed to fully leveraging its capabilities as the nation's hub for clinical research innovation. Our focus remains on empowering the research community and advancing the critical mission of making medical breakthroughs possible right here on the NIH campus.\"",
      "Even before President Trump began his second term, the hospital had struggled with lagging patient numbers. Before the pandemic, it averaged more than 110 patients daily. Those numbers plummeted starting in 2020, government documents show. During the 2022 fiscal year, there were about 73 patients, on average, in the hospital per day.",
      "While yearly figures have increased since then, they have not gone back to pre-pandemic levels. NIH documents show that the hospital saw an average of roughly 81 patients per day during fiscal 2024, which ended in September. Still, one NIH worker said: \"This is a manufactured crisis. COVID was not.\"",
      "The federal government has also moved to tighten rules surrounding visitors from abroad, which likely limits how many people living in the U.S. without legal status would come to the NIH for care.",
      "Before Mr. Trump, officials developed a new visitor policy for the NIH that required people who aren't U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to register online before arriving. But its implementation was delayed, Gilman said. It did not launch until late January, after President Joe Biden was no longer in office and around the time the Trump administration began its deportation operation.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has carried out widespread raids and arrests and allowed immigration authorities unprecedented access to various federal data sources \u2014 including tax information and Medicaid recipients' personal data \u2014 as part of its immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The clinical center's most recent annual report said around 600 patients in 2024 were from abroad.",
      "Now \"international patients are terrified to come,\" said one recently departed clinician. \"They don't know what will happen to them.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\"",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated.",
      "The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.",
      "Mr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts.",
      "The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority.",
      "Even people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\"",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",
      "As of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously.",
      "\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared at Mr. Trump's side for the announcement and presented him with a glass Apple plate he said was engraved for the president and set in a base of 24K gold.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "The 22 now-terminated projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Most of the projects that were canceled were for vaccines that fight COVID-19 or the flu, Kennedy\u00a0said.",
      "They include proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and other drugmakers that were rejected or canceled, along with a now-shuttered award to Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine, according to an HHS statement. The projects were reviewed and canceled over the last few weeks, said Kennedy.",
      "A Moderna spokesperson told CBS News that the company's H5N1 (bird flu) contract was canceled in May, and it isn't aware of any new BARDA cancellations.",
      "Kennedy framed the move as part of a step away from research into mRNA vaccines. Those types of vaccines\u00a0use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce antibody production to protect against an infection. The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "On Wednesday, CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked President Trump for his response to Kennedy's announcement, pointing out that the president had been the driving force behind Operation Warp Speed, the public-private partnership that developed and distributed mRNA COVID vaccines in a compressed timeline of months, rather than the years it had previously taken to produce effective vaccines.",
      "\"Everything about it has been amazing,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"but you know, that was now a long time ago, and we're onto other things. But we are speaking about it \u2014 we have meetings about it tomorrow ... we're looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases.\"",
      "Jerome Adams, who was surgeon general during Mr. Trump's first term,\u00a0condemned\u00a0Kennedy's announcement in a post on X.",
      "\"I've tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions \u2013 but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,\" Adams wrote. \"mRNA technology has uses that go far beyond vaccines\u2026 and the vaccine they helped develop in record time is credited with saving millions.\"",
      "He noted that researchers are developing mRNA applications in therapies and vaccines for flu, RSV, HIV, Zika, cancer and autoimmune diseases, and said the U.S. should be \"doubling down on what works - not defunding it.\"",
      "Leading infectious disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 a physician who chairs the Senate health committee \u2014 called Kennedy's decision \"unfortunate\" and said he's \"wasting the money which is already invested.\"",
      "\"He has also conceded to China an important technology needed to combat cancer and infectious disease,\" Cassidy wrote on X.",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.\"",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",

      "The announcement by the president comes just a week after he said he would be slapping a 25% tariff on imports from India, as well as an unspecified \"penalty,\" because of its purchases of Russian military equipment and energy. The additional tariff are set to take effect in 21 days, according to the directive. The latest action brings the total duties imposed on Indian products to 50%.",

      "The hotel is in St. Charles, Illinois, west of Chicago. The St. Charles Police Department said first responders arrived at the hotel around 7:15 a.m. They \"conducted a thorough search and no device was found,\" police said.",
      "\"In response to the threat, 400 people were immediately evacuated and the area was secured as bomb squad units conducted their investigation,\" the department said in a statement. \"Following clearance from authorities, all guests and staff have safely returned to the premises.\"",
      "State Rep. Ann Johnson said in a statement that \"a bomb threat forced us to evacuate our hotel\" early Wednesday. \"Thankfully, no one was harmed,\" she added.",
      "The House Democratic caucus confirmed that a threat had been made, as did Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Pritzker said in a statement that \"threats of violence will be investigated and those responsible will be held accountable\" and that he had instructed Illinois state police to investigate.",

      "More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state Sunday to prevent a quorum in the state House of Representatives to move forward on a bill that would set new congressional districts. Texas Republicans had taken up a rare mid-decade redistricting after President Trump insisted that the state's maps could be redrawn to give the GOP more of an edge. Texas currently has 38 representatives in Congress, comprised of 23 Republicans and 15 Democrats. The new maps unveiled by Texas Republicans could net the GOP up to five more seats.",

John Cornyn, whom Paxton has challenged in the GOP primary, to write a letter to the FBI asking the agency to intervene.",

She was convicted in a media firestorm of false reporting and mischaracterization of evidence,\" Markus wrote. \"Now, with her case pending before the Supreme Court, the government seeks to unseal untested, hearsay-laden grand jury transcripts, which contain statements presented in secret and never challenged by the adversarial process.\u00a0 Maxwell has never been allowed to review those transcripts even though the government did not oppose her recent request to do so.\"",
      "In a court filing last week, the Justice Department admitted that the grand jury transcripts that it is attempting to unseal from the investigations into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell contain testimony from only two law enforcement officers.",
      "The grand juries that indicted Epstein and Maxwell did not hear direct testimony from any alleged victims, Attorney General Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told a judge in the Southern District of New York in their attempts to unseal the testimony.",
      "In a\u00a0filing earlier Tuesday, the Justice Department said that the grand jury transcripts it is hoping are unsealed were mostly already made public during Epstein and Maxwell's court proceedings.",
      "\"The enclosed, annotated transcripts show that much of the information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony\u2014with the exception of the identities of certain victims and witnesses\u2014was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "The government also has asked for until Aug. 8 to decide whether or not they are going to ask for the grand jury exhibits to be unsealed as well, as those \"substantive\" exhibits that are not currently in the public record.",
      "Epstein accuser Annie Farmer wants grand jury transcripts released",
      "Before a different judge in New York, lawyers for Epstein accuser Annie Farmer asked for the transcripts to be unsealed Tuesday, arguing a public release could help remedy a \"lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and their co-conspirators.\"",
      "\"Given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, unsealing the grand jury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and those who enabled it,\" they wrote in a letter.",
      "The attorneys said victims' names and identifying information should be redacted, but the court shouldn't \"rubber stamp\" redactions about others who might be mentioned in the transcripts.",
      "Earlier this week, two other unnamed Epstein victims also asked for restrictions to be put in place to protect Epstein and Maxwell's victims, but were unopposed to the transcripts being unsealed.",
      "One victim asked for the judge to \"show us all the files with only the necessary redactions!\" and \"be done with it and allow me/us to heal.\"",
      "They asked that their attorney be able to review the suggested redactions \"as they are the ones who also know the victims, their names, their truths and their stories unlike the United States Government who did not and does not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/ abuser for information,\" referring to the Justice Department's two-day interview last month with Maxwell.",
      "Another victim asked for a third-party review of the files before their release, to \"ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed through this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are completely and entirely protected.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawyers for Epstein's estate are taking no position on the Justice Department's motion to unseal transcripts, they said in a court filing Tuesday.",
      "Last month, a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into Epstein in the state. That ruling only applied to transcripts of proceedings by federal grand juries that were convened in Florida, and did not apply to the transcripts in New York.",
      "Trump administration could release parts of Maxwell-Blanche conversation",
      "Late last month, Blanche met with Maxwell over the course of two days. There are now ongoing discussions among Trump administration officials about whether to make some of those conversations public, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Blanche said last month the Justice Department will \"share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time.\" It's not clear what topics they covered: Markus has\u00a0said Maxwell was asked about \"100 different people\" and answered \"every single question,\" but hasn't elaborated on the substance of their conversation.",
      "An administration official confirmed there is audio and a transcript of Blanche's discussions with Maxwell, a standard practice for legal interviews.",
      "CNN was first to report on discussions about releasing the Blanche-Maxwell conversations.",

      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump whether he sees Vance as the \"heir apparent to MAGA.\" The president responded that Vance is \"most likely\" the leading contender.",
      "\"It's too early, obviously, to talk about it. But certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point,\" the president said during an unrelated executive order-signing ceremony.",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and suggested he's \"somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form.\" And he said the Republican Party has some other \"incredible people.\"",
      "The president has singled out Rubio and Vance in the past, but has mostly avoided choosing a favorite.

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 13:47:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, NOAA forecasters updated their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect.",
    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, a combination of factors influence the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to\u00a0prepare.",
      "\"NOAA stands ready to provide the forecasts and warnings that are vital for safeguarding lives, property, and communities,\" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement Thursday. \"As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "Researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "They also recently updated their predictions, now estimating that eight hurricanes will occur over the course of the 2025 season with 16 named storms overall.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "While the 2017 megaflash may be the longest in horizontal distance, it did not have the longest duration. Researchers estimated that it lasted just over 7 seconds. The current WMO-recognized record for longest duration megaflash occurred over Argentina and Uruguay in June 2020 and was about 17 seconds.",

      "Catching up from behind and below, the Crew 11 Dragon Endeavour looped up ahead of the lab complex, then to a point directly above the outpost before slowly moving straight in for a linkup at the space-facing port of the forward Harmony module at 2:27 a.m. ET as the two spacecraft orbited 264 miles above the south Pacific Ocean.",
      "Hooks and latches then engaged, pulling the Crew Dragon's nose firmly into the docking mechanism, which locked the craft in place. Umbilicals automatically connected and flight controllers began a series of leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal.",

      "The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:43 a.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mission control kept a close eye on clouds rolling into the area shortly before launch time.",
      "With commander Zena Cardman and co-pilot Mike Fincke monitoring cockpit displays, flanked on the left by Japanese Astronaut Kimiya Yui and on the right by cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, the Crew Dragon capsule began its climb. Nine minutes later, they reached orbit and set off after the International Space Station.",
      "\"I have no emotions but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime,\" radioed Cardman, making her first flight. \"Thank you, this has been an incredible honor.\"",
      "Added Fincke, a three-flight veteran: \"Boy, it's great to be back in orbit again! Thank you to SpaceX and NASA to get us here. What a ride!\"",
      "The crew\u00a0originally hoped to take off Thursday, but clouds built up over the launch site and SpaceX called off the countdown just 67 seconds before liftoff. Weather remained a concern the second time around, but in the end conditions were \"go\" for launch.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Fincke is a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",
      "Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under the agreement.",
      "A long-awaited mission aboard the space station",
      "Crew 11 will be welcomed aboard the space station by by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand: Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",
      "Said departing Crew 10 commander McClain: \"We feel very safe.\"",

      "The new version is also the best at coding to date, allowing users to build websites from scratch within minutes. In a demo during the call, Altman used ChatGPT-5 to create another large language model, or GPT, in less than 5 minutes.",
      "Altman called the new chatbot's ability to write code on demand its \"superpower,\" adding that the advancement would have been \"unimaginable at any previous point in history.\"",
      "Asked about how the technology might impact the livelihood of human programmers, Altman said he thought the technology would actually create more job opportunities for as demand for software rises.",
      "According to OpenAI, the new model will also be better at answering health-related questions, flagging potential concerns and helping users understand test results from their doctor. The company noted, however, that the technology \"does not replace a medical professional.\"",
      "Users around the world will be able to access ChatGPT-5 for free, according to OpenAI. Asked about the commercial rationale behind offering a free global model, Turley said the company's mission is to ensure AI benefits all humanity.",

    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.",
      "Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said.",

      "Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about 6 hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged 3 hours a day.",

      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",
      "\"We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE impact non-profits and health care in addition to the government,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "Layoffs are also accelerating in the vast retail sector as tariffs raise the cost of doing business, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have announced more than 80,000 cuts through July, up nearly 250% compared to the same period last year, the firm found.",
      "\"Retailers are being impacted by tariffs, inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty causing layoffs and store closures. Further declines in consumer spending could trigger additional losses,\" the group said.",

    "summary": "Florida Power & Light is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years.",
    "story": [
      "Florida's biggest utility company is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years, which environmental advocates say would represent the largest utility hike in U.S. history.",
      "Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of Florida-based energy company NextEra Energy, outlined the changes in a petition filed in February with the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's electric industry. According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by approximately $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",
      "In her\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0testimony for the company, FPL senior director of financial forecasting Ina Laney said Lawton's analysis was \"fundamentally flawed and misleading,\" and that it \"fails to recognize the significant customer benefits derived from FPL's financial strategy.\"",
      "Added Laney, \"FPL consistently achieves industry-leading performance in service reliability and cost management.\"",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News in an interview Thursday that Israel intends to take control of all of Gaza, but not to govern it. He said Israel does not want to \"keep\" Gaza, but instead \"hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly.\"",
      "Later on Thursday, Netanyahu was expected to discuss plans with senior ministers for the Israeli military to take control of more of Gaza's territory.",
      "When asked what advice President Trump might offer, Huckabee said: \"I remember him saying that, 'I know what I would do, but I'm not sure anybody else would do it.' I think we got the inference of: It would not be good for Hamas.\"",
      "The group representing families of the hostages and the missing abducted during the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack called on Israelis Wednesday to march to the headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces in response to \"recent statements about occupying the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "\"Time is running out \u2014 our loved ones can't wait any longer. We either bring them home now, or we lose them for good,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement, calling for a single deal for every remaining hostage to be released. \"There are moments in history when we must stand up and do what's right \u2014 this is that moment.\"",

      "Negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas broke down in recent weeks, with each side accusing the other of being responsible for the talks' failure.",
      "\"I think the negotiations have broken down completely because Hamas is not serious about negotiating,\" Huckabee said. \"I'm not sure they ever were, but they certainly aren't anymore. Europe has given them some cover. When European leaders are putting more pressure on Israel than they are Hamas \u2014 and they're talking about people in Gaza, and they're not talking about the hostages \u2014 Hamas is celebrating, and they're realizing that, you know, they're winning the message war here.\"",
      "Huckabee said he wasn't sure there was a way to revive the ceasefire negotiations.",
      "\"I think the alternative is to recognize that they understand one thing: They lose,\" Huckabee said. \"They have to be defeated. And President Trump has repeatedly said Hamas has no future in Gaza and they can't lead it. I think that's exactly right.\"",

It takes more time than I wish it did. But we certainly are asking a lot of questions about who did this. What are the pieces of evidence? We want to be able to serve the families that, as an American citizen, that's important to us,\" Huckabee said.",
      "On reports of starvation in Gaza and getting aid to its population",
      "Mr. Trump said in July that the children in Gaza \"look very hungry. That's real starvation stuff,\" amid warnings of famine in Gaza from international humanitarian groups. Aid agencies have been calling for a surge of aid to the strip.",
      "\"I think that there are certainly people suffering in Gaza. Part of the reason is because you've had pallets and trucks for food that the U.N. won't take in \u2014 because they say they don't want military escort from the IDF \u2014 but they say it's not safe,\" Huckabee said. \"There's not been a lack of food or even a lack of attempt. It's been an inefficient way of getting it and it's been a problem because you have a terror organization who is stealing it, looting it, and then turning around and selling it to the people who are hungry.\"",
      "Desperate and starving people have been looting food trucks when they enter Gaza, but the World Food Program told CBS News there is no evidence food aid is being diverted to Hamas.",

      "The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, and the GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to control crowds.",

      "\"They know it's going to take years to rebuild their homes, their businesses, their families. They have their own vision for what that's going to look like. But there are undoubtedly many people who live there now who would love a way to leave and go somewhere else.\"",
      "Huckabee said no one should be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "\"They shouldn't be forced out. Nobody should be required to leave. And it's interesting that while there have been allegations that people are going to be forced out, both the U.S. and the government of Israel has been very clear: Nobody's going to be forced out, at least not by the U.S. And Israel has said it doesn't plan to force people to leave, but it wants people to have the freedom to start over, make a new life away from Gaza and away from the horrific memories they have that were inflicted upon them.\"",
      "When asked about whether he supported a two-state solution \u2014 the long-standing U.S. policy toward the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 Huckabee said, \"It's really not an ambassador's position to make the decision of what that policy would be.\"",
      "\"It's sort of an aspirational goal: 'We need a two-state solution,'\" Huckabee said. \"But when you start asking people the specifics of what it looks like and where it's going to be. What are the boundaries? It's interesting that very few people have an answer for that.\"",

    "story": [
      "FBI Director Kash Patel has agreed to aid the search for the Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to protest new congressional maps, Sen. John Cornyn said Thursday.",
      "Texas Republicans have been trying to bring the Democrats back so there are enough lawmakers on the floor for a quorum, which would enable them to vote on new congressional maps likely to increase the GOP advantage in the state. Texas requires two-thirds of the House \u2014 or 100 of the 150 representatives \u2014 to be present for a quorum.",
      "It's unclear what the laws the legislators might have broken that would involve the FBI. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has called for civil arrest and said he had ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to force them to return. But Texas DPS does not have jurisdiction outside the state.",
      "Abbott and Cornyn have raised allegations of bribery, since the lawmakers' quorum break is being funded by donations from various groups, including former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's PAC and other Democratic groups. In addition to travel expenses, each Democrat faces fines of $500 a day.",
      "\"I thank President Trump and Director Patel for supporting and swiftly acting on my call for the federal government to hold these supposed lawmakers accountable for fleeing Texas,\" Cornyn said. \"We cannot allow these rogue legislators to avoid their constitutional responsibilities.\"",
      "In response, Texas Rep. John Bucy, one of the lawmakers who left the state, called the FBI's involvement \"the kind of authoritarian overreach we condemn in other countries.\"",
      "Abbott last month called a 30-day special session with 18 agenda items, including embarking on a rare mid-decade redistricting ordered by President Trump. Texas has 38 representatives in Congress, 25 Republicans and 13 Democrats. Mr. Trump asked Texas Republicans to redraw the congressional map to deliver up to five more seats for the GOP.",
      "\"We are entitled to five more seats,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "This is not the first time Democrats in Texas have left the state to prevent a quorum, and not even the first time they have used this tactic to protest a mid-decade redistricting.",
      "\"When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" said Texas Rep. Gene Wu, the Democrats' Minority Leader, in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "Abbot earlier this week said he would ask a judge to remove the Democratic lawmakers for vacating their office, citing a 2021 nonbinding opinion by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. On Tuesday, Abbott filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court \u2014 which is packed with Abbott's own appointees \u2014 to remove Wu from office if he didn't return by Thursday. Abbott called Wu the \"ringleader\" of the quorum break.",
      "Paxton, meanwhile, on Wednesday said he is launching an investigation into O'Rourke's PAC for financing the out-of-state travel and fines.

    "summary": "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, NOAA forecasters updated their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect.",
    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, a combination of factors influence the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to\u00a0prepare.",
      "\"NOAA stands ready to provide the forecasts and warnings that are vital for safeguarding lives, property, and communities,\" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement Thursday. \"As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "Researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "They also recently updated their predictions, now estimating that eight hurricanes will occur over the course of the 2025 season with 16 named storms overall.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",

    "summary": "A group of Democrats in Congress is seeking to stop Department of Government Efficiency employees from moving into permanent positions in the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of Democrats in Congress is seeking to stop Department of Government Efficiency employees from moving into permanent positions in the federal government, penning a letter asking for more information on DOGE's presence within agencies after Elon Musk's exit earlier this year.",
      "\"Although Elon Musk has departed, his influence remains, as DOGE and its employees attempt to become a permanent part of the federal government, scattered across agencies where they can continue to sabotage key functions from within,\" Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, along with Rep. Robert Garcia of California, wrote in a letter late Wednesday.",
      "Writing to Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, the Democratic senators and ranking member on the House Oversight Committee sought more information on how DOGE has embedded itself in the federal government.",
      "The lawmakers called DOGE's continued presence in federal agencies \"alarming,\" outlining in the letter, obtained exclusively by CBS News, that \"employees are embedding themselves in the federal government in key agency positions\" which they argue threatens the government's ability \"to serve the American people,\" while alluding to potential violations of civil service laws.",
      "Kupor refuted the lawmakers' characterization of the civil service hiring process in a statement to CBS News, saying OPM \"reviews all requests to appoint current or recent political appointees to career roles for compliance with merit systems principles and civil service laws,\" while noting that \"all federal hires undergo required background checks, ethics reviews, and suitability screenings.\"",
      "\"No DOGE-affiliated individuals have 'unlawfully burrowed' into career roles,\" Kupor said. \"We welcome oversight grounded in facts.\"",
      "The Democrats' request comes as DOGE's presence in Washington has changed shape since Musk left his role as a \"special government employee\" in late May, when he reached the maximum amount of time he could serve in the position. President Trump thanked Musk \"and all of his people\" at the time, saying, \"almost all of them are staying, and they're going to be with us. And you're going to see the results coming long into the future.\"",
      "Musk pledged upon his departure that \"this is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "The Tesla CEO began the cost-cutting effort in January and had initially pledged to cut $2 trillion of government spending, but later lowered the benchmark to $1 trillion. At the time of Musk's departure, the White House said DOGE's efforts saved roughly $170 billion in spending. But that figure has been disputed, with a number of errors and miscalculations on the initiative's \"wall of receipts.\"",
      "Since Musk left the role, DOGE has continued to post about its cost cutting. A recent review by CBS News found that the claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated. Still, Musk pledged when he left the job that DOGE is \"like a way of life\" and would be \"permeating throughout the government\" to secure $1 trillion in savings \"over time.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Vought outlined at a House Appropriations Committee hearing in June that the vision for DOGE going forward would be \"far more institutionalized at the actual agency,\" saying many DOGE employees are functioning \"almost as in-house consultants as a part of the agency's leadership.\" The leadership of DOGE, Vought said, is \"now much more decentralized.\"",
      "For some, questions have remained about how the effort would continue to shape government agencies. Writing to Vought and Kupor, the Democratic lawmakers sought answers to a number of questions, including who currently leads DOGE and queries about the presence of DOGE employees within the federal government more broadly.",
      "The lawmakers said that converting DOGE appointees to career federal service roles could \"potentially run afoul of laws that explicitly ban political considerations and loyalty tests in hiring practices,\" adding that \"it is unclear who newly embedded DOGE staff are accountable to and if they truly serve within the chain of command of the agencies they work for.\" They urged OPM to enforce civil service regulations \"that prohibit political patronage in government hiring.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 11:43:14 -0400",
    "summary": "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

But it isn't the only state where redistricting pushes are underway, as California and other states consider similar moves ahead of the midterms.",
      "Typically, states redraw congressional and legislative districts after the decennial census to reflect population shifts. Texas undertook its redistricting effort after President Trump suggested in mid-July the state should redraw for Republican advantage. About a week earlier, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, had written to the Texas governor and state attorney general to complain that four of the state's current districts were \"coalition districts\" \u2014 that is, districts with different racial groups that support the same candidate \u2014 that were \"not protected by the Voting Rights Act.\"",

      "Looming over the redistricting efforts is a case before the Supreme Court that could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and attempts to remedy alleged vote dilution. The dispute involves Louisiana's congressional map, and while the high court heard arguments in March, it set the case for re-argument in its next term, which starts in October.",

      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have suggested that the Democratic-controlled legislature could create new congressional maps that are more friendly to Democrats.",
      "\"We're sick and tired of being pushed around when other states don't have the same aspirations that we always have had, and I hold those dear, but I cannot ignore that,\" Hochul said at a press conference with some Texas Democratic lawmakers earlier this week. \"This the playing field has changed dramatically, and shame on us if we ignore that fact and cling tight to the vestiges of the past. That era is over. Donald Trump eliminated that. Forever.\"",
      "But New York faces some steep obstacles in trying to redraw the maps before the midterms. New York's constitution calls for a bipartisan commission to draw up the congressional maps, although the state Assembly and Senate get final approval. In the 2021 redistricting, New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, said Democrats had \"unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts\" and ordered a special master to redraw the district.",
      "With the help of these maps, Republicans were able to flip four seats in New York in the 2022 elections, making the congressional delegation 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans. Democrats sued, and in a 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals said those maps were supposed to be temporary and ordered an independent commission to redraw the maps. The new districts gave Democrats a slight edge. With these maps, Democrats flipped four seats in 2024, giving them 19 seats in the state and Republicans seven.",
      "If Democrats wanted to lead an effort to change New York's constitution, it would require an affirmative vote in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature, and then it would have to be approved by voters, as Hochul herself noted on Monday. The 2025 legislative session is already over, with the next session starting in January 2026.",
      "\"This could be really more on the ballot in the fall of '27 and be enacted in time for the congressional races in 2028 as well as the presidential \u2014 so, it is not the timeline that I would have preferred, but it does shave off four years from another through the process,\" Hochul said Monday. \"But we're going to also look at litigation strategies. We're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "The state constitution also prohibits mid-decade redistricting, and any new proposal to amend it to allow a redrawing of state lines before the next census would have to clear the current state legislature and the one elected in 2026.",
      "\"The earliest that could go into effect would be after the 2027 elections, preventing the state from re-redistricting until the 2028 election cycle,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and professor at New York Law School.",
      "Following Hochul's suggestion that the state's redistricting commission be disbanded, Wice said it's not a surprise that some are calling for it to be scrapped after the panel failed to complete its work in 2022 \u2014 until a court stepped in.",
      "\"A state legislature can draw a responsibly developed map if it follows objective and prioritized criteria and works in an open and transparent manner, inviting public participation and review,\" he said.",
      "Missouri",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Missouri, and the Legislature is tasked with drawing its congressional districts. State lawmakers approved a congressional redistricting plan in 2022, after which Republicans won six of Missouri's eight congressional seats.",
      "But some state lawmakers want to extend the GOP's hold on the congressional map to 7-1. State party leaders may target the 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Although Cleaver won by over 23 points in 2024, Republicans in neighboring districts each won by more than 40 points.",
      "The only time Missouri has engaged in mid-decade redistricting was in the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled each district had to be nearly equal in population, and a new Senatorial Appointment Commission was established to redraw the Congressional districts for the 1966 election.",
      "State Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin told Columbia's KSSZ 93.9 last week that it is \"likely\" the Legislature would be called in for a special session by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. He told St. Louis' Fox affiliate over the weekend that he supported the idea, saying \"is Missouri represented properly in Washington, D.C., and, quite frankly, what can we do to support President Trump's agenda?\"",
      "Lt. Gov. David Wasinger also indicated support for redrawing the congressional map, noting in a statement that Missouri is a \"solidly conservative state.\"",
      "\"Despite this, our current congressional map still sends two progressive Democrats to push a liberal agenda in D.C., misrepresenting the will of Missouri voters,\" he said in a statement. \"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them.\"",
      "The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a coalition of conservative state lawmakers, has also been urging Kehoe, a Republican, to convene a special session of the state General Assembly to redraw its congressional map \"consistent with President Trump's recommendation.\"",
      "\"The most current congressional map that was passed was a weak compromise \u2014 inconsistent with the political will of Missouri voters,\" the Missouri Freedom Caucus said in a statement last week. \"It's time this super-majority Republican party in Missouri grows a spine and actually delivers the congressional map that reflects the strong conservative values of this great state, as the political makeup of this state clearly demands.\"",
      "Florida",
      "In Florida, the congressional maps are created by the Legislature and approved by the governor.",
      "Florida Republicans have 20 seats in the U.S. House, with Democrats holding just eight. Although Democrats had challenged the current maps in court, the Florida Supreme Court in July upheld the elimination of a majority Black district.",
      "Despite that victory, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that he was \"seriously\" looking at asking the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the maps.",
      "DeSantis has also criticizedlong insisted that he felt the 2020 Census was flawed and Florida should have gained two cCongressional seats, rather than one.",
      "\"I do think we are going to be looking at the pathways to be able do the redistricting here in Florida,\" DeSantis said on July 30.",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Florida state government, controlling the governor's mansion and both chambers of the Legislature. It would be difficult for Florida Democrats to break quorum because a simple majority is only needed for a quorum in Tallahassee, and Democrats are a superminority.",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\"",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated.",
      "The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.",
      "Mr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts.",
      "The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority.",
      "Even people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\"",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",
      "As of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously.",
      "\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, which retails for around $75,400, had a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for all vehicles with the model years 2022 to 2024, according to a new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute, or HLDI.",

      "To determine the most commonly swiped vehicles, the HLDI analyzed stolen vehicle data for 2022-2024 car models between the years of 2021 to 2024. Their analysis hit upon a few shared traits between many of the cars favored by auto thieves.",
      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",
      "Earlier this year, Chevy owner General Motors released a software update for 2020 to 2024 Camaro models that was aimed at improving security.",
      "\"This body control module software enhancement involves an important security update for certain model year 2020 to 2024 Chevrolet Camaros,\" a GM spokesman said in a statement to auto blog GM Authority. \"GM counters vehicle theft methods as they evolve.

The suspected shooter, who was taken into custody, used his personal weapon in the shooting, Brig. Gen. John Lubas, the fort's commander, told reporters.",

    "summary": "A metal ring, about the size of a quarter, led to Matthew Ecker's murder charge for the death of Alexandra Pennig.",
    "story": [
      "In the early morning hours of Dec. 16, 2022, St. Paul, Minnesota, homicide detectives Abby DeSanto and Jennifer O'Donnell were called to a downtown apartment building to investigate a reported suicide. A 32-year-old woman named Alexandra Pennig had been found dead in her bathroom with a single gunshot wound to the head.",
      "For the detectives, what really happened to Pennig is something that still haunts them to this day. And it's the question at the center of \"The Strange Shooting of Alex Pennig,\" reported by \"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales. An encore of the episode airs Saturday, Aug. 9, at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. (DVR alert: Possible delay due to the WNBA on CBS: Chicago Sky @ Indiana Fever.)",
      "When detectives DeSanto and O'Donnell arrived at the apartment, they found out Pennig had not been alone at the time of her death. A man named Matthew Ecker was also there. Ecker and Pennig were both nurses and had met two years earlier when they worked at the same clinic. Ecker told first responders the gun was his, and that Pennig had grabbed it, locked herself in the bathroom, and then fired the shot. \"I thought everything was fine,\" he said. \"And then she just grabbed the gun.\" Ecker told first responders that after he heard the shot he immediately broke open the bathroom door: \"I tried to do what I could. And then I washed my hands \u2026 That's why I don't have anything on my hands.\" Ecker said he then called 911. But it was too late. He said he didn't know why Pennig would do this.",
      "In Pennig's apartment, there was alcohol and six bottles of prescription medication, including antidepressants, all prescribed to Pennig. For the detectives, it suggested Alex might have been depressed, and they wondered if Ecker's story that she took her own life was true.",
      "But they also noticed something that seemed to contradict Ecker's story. He had said he washed his hands in the bathroom sink before calling 911, but DeSanto recalled the first responders told her the sink was dry. \"The sink was dry. If he had said, you know, he called the police right away, that sink probably would've been still wet,\" DeSanto explained, \"but it was very dry in there.\"",
      "When O'Donnell looked into Pennig's background, she learned from Alex's parents that Alex had struggled in the past with depression and addiction. \"I had asked, um, if she had been suicidal in the past, um, and dad said, she had, um, tried, uh, to overdose before,\" said O'Donnell. According to Alex's father, Jim Pennig, several years prior, Alex had taken a handful of pills \"and then had told her mom that she was attempting suicide.\" After that, Alex's parents told the detectives they sent her to rehab, and she eventually got clean. Despite her past struggles, Alex's parents told O'Donnell they had just seen her at Thanksgiving. And her mom, Mary Jo Pennig, had just talked to her that evening. \"She was doing well,\" she said. For them, the idea that their daughter had died by suicide did not make sense. \"Knowing your kid, it didn't fit,\" Mary Jo Pennig said.",
      "Since Ecker was the last person to see Alex Pennig alive, the detectives zeroed in on him. \"He's the only one that can tell us what happened. He was the only one that was there,\" said O'Donnell. They questioned Ecker about what had happened that night. He said he and Alex Pennig had gone out to several local bars, and when they arrived back at her place, everything was fine: \"We were laughing on the way home,\" said Ecker. DeSanto asked him if, once they got into the apartment, they had gotten into a fight. Ecker said they did not.",
      "DET. ABBY DESANTO: You guys weren't arguing or anything?",
      "MATTHEW ECKER: No.",
      "DET. ABBY DESANTO: There's no fight with you two?",
      "MATTHEW ECKER: Not between us.",
      "For hours, Ecker continued to say Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom, fired the shot and then he broke open the door to try and help her: \"That gun went off behind a closed door \u2026 I did not shoot her.\"",
      "But the detectives had their doubts. Then they got a call from the forensic unit that was still processing the scene. And according to O'Donnell, what they found changed everything. \"Once Alex was moved, they found underneath where Alex had been laying was a round metal piece,\" she said. It was the shape of a ring, and about the size of a quarter. O'Donnell said it was part of the lock from the bathroom door, and the fact that it had been discovered under Pennig was key. \"For us, it meant that the door was forced open before she was shot.\"",
      "The detectives felt the discovery of the metal ring proved Ecker had lied and had not broken the door open after he heard the shot. The detectives suspected Pennig and Ecker had argued and that she had locked the bathroom door to get away from him. Then Ecker broke open the door, the metal part broke off and fell to the ground, and then he shot Pennig and she landed on top of it.",
      "Ecker was charged with second-degree murder. In February 2024 he was convicted and later sentenced to 30 years.",

      "Despite the massive destruction suffered by Pompeii, an ancient Roman city home to more than 20,000 people before the eruption, some survivors who could not afford to start a new life elsewhere are believed to have returned to live in the devastated area.",
      "Archaeologists believe they were joined by others looking for a place to settle and hoping to find valuable items left by Pompeii's earlier residents in the rubble.",

      "\"Thanks to the new excavations, the picture is now clearer: post-79 Pompeii reemerges, more than a city, a precarious and grey agglomeration, a kind of camp, a favela among the still recognizable ruins of the Pompeii that once was,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the site.",
      "Evidence that the site was reoccupied had been detected in the past, but in the rush to access Pompeii's colorful frescoes and still-intact homes, \"the faint traces of the site's reoccupation were literally removed and often swept away without any documentation.\"",
      "\"The momentous episode of the city's destruction in 79 AD has monopolized the memory,\" said Zuchtriegel.",

      "In a wide-ranging interview with CBS News, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said it'll be up to the Israeli government to decide whether to fully take over the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\" Huckabee said. \"Certainly, if they ask for wisdom, counsel, advice, I'm sure the president would offer it. But ultimately, it's the decision that the Israelis and only the Israelis can make.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News in an interview Thursday that Israel intends to take control of all of Gaza, but not to govern it. He said Israel does not want to \"keep\" Gaza, but instead \"hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly.\"",
      "Later on Thursday, Netanyahu was expected to discuss plans with senior ministers for the Israeli military to take control of more of Gaza's territory.",
      "When asked what advice President Trump might offer, Huckabee said: \"I remember him saying that, 'I know what I would do, but I'm not sure anybody else would do it.' I think we got the inference of: It would not be good for Hamas.\"",
      "The group representing families of the hostages and the missing abducted during the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack called on Israelis Wednesday to march to the headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces in response to \"recent statements about occupying the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "\"Time is running out \u2014 our loved ones can't wait any longer. We either bring them home now, or we lose them for good,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement, calling for a single deal for every remaining hostage to be released. \"There are moments in history when we must stand up and do what's right \u2014 this is that moment.\"",
      "On negotiations for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire",
      "Negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas broke down in recent weeks, with each side accusing the other of being responsible for the talks' failure.",
      "\"I think the negotiations have broken down completely because Hamas is not serious about negotiating,\" Huckabee said. \"I'm not sure they ever were, but they certainly aren't anymore. Europe has given them some cover. When European leaders are putting more pressure on Israel than they are Hamas \u2014 and they're talking about people in Gaza, and they're not talking about the hostages \u2014 Hamas is celebrating, and they're realizing that, you know, they're winning the message war here.\"",
      "Huckabee said he wasn't sure there was a way to revive the ceasefire negotiations.",
      "\"I think the alternative is to recognize that they understand one thing: They lose,\" Huckabee said. \"They have to be defeated. And President Trump has repeatedly said Hamas has no future in Gaza and they can't lead it. I think that's exactly right.\"",
      "On American citizens killed in the occupied West Bank",
      "Six Americans have been killed in the occupied West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023, allegedly by Israeli settlers, including 20-year-old Saifullah Kamel Musallet.",
      "Huckabee said he has \"asked for, and we'll continue to demand, a full-throated investigation of what happened, who did it.\"",
      "He said investigators had gotten Musallet's medical records around a week ago.",
      "\"He's an American citizen. I went and visited with his family and his home \u2014 committed to the family: We will do everything we can to find out who did it,\" Huckabee said.",
      "40-year-old Khamis al-Ayyad, also an American citizen, recently died after trying to put out fires set to homes and cars by Israeli settlers near his home in the West Bank, his family said.",
      "Huckabee told CBS News the exact details of al-Ayyad's death were not yet clear.",
      "\"It's not always simple to get the full cooperation from all the authorities, because you're dealing with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities, so that's part of the challenge that we face. It takes more time than I wish it did. But we certainly are asking a lot of questions about who did this. What are the pieces of evidence? We want to be able to serve the families that, as an American citizen, that's important to us,\" Huckabee said.",
      "On reports of starvation in Gaza and getting aid to its population",
      "Mr. Trump said in July that the children in Gaza \"look very hungry. That's real starvation stuff,\" amid warnings of famine in Gaza from international humanitarian groups. Aid agencies have been calling for a surge of aid to the strip.",
      "\"I think that there are certainly people suffering in Gaza. Part of the reason is because you've had pallets and trucks for food that the U.N. won't take in \u2014 because they say they don't want military escort from the IDF \u2014 but they say it's not safe,\" Huckabee said. \"There's not been a lack of food or even a lack of attempt. It's been an inefficient way of getting it and it's been a problem because you have a terror organization who is stealing it, looting it, and then turning around and selling it to the people who are hungry.\"",
      "Desperate and starving people have been looting food trucks when they enter Gaza, but the World Food Program told CBS News there is no evidence food aid is being diverted to Hamas.",
      "\"I'm shocked they would say that,\" Huckabee said.",
      "Huckabee said food distribution sites run by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were proving effective in delivering aid to Palestinians in Gaza, and that the number of sites would be scaled up from four to 16, with the hubs potentially staying open 24 hours a day.",
      "According to the U.N., over 1,400 people have been killed trying to get food aid in Gaza, most of them, it says, as a result of IDF fire. Nearly 900 Palestinians have been killed near GHF sites.",
      "Throughout their months in operation, GHF sites have become flashpoints of desperation, with videos showing mass crowds of people gathering outside who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, and the GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to control crowds.",
      "\"We've had reports that there have been incidences, but forgive me if I'm a little skeptical when someone says these people are being killed at the job site,\" Huckabee said. \"If there was some random shooting of people who were coming for food, those people would face severe consequences.\"",
      "On a two-state solution and what happens after the Israel-Hamas war",
      "Huckabee said that what happens to Palestinians living in Gaza after the war ends \"may depend on them \u2014 how many of them want to stay and rebuild their lives. We talked to some last week, and that's what they really want to do,\" Huckabee said.",
      "\"They know it's going to take years to rebuild their homes, their businesses, their families. They have their own vision for what that's going to look like. But there are undoubtedly many people who live there now who would love a way to leave and go somewhere else.\"",
      "Huckabee said no one should be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "\"They shouldn't be forced out. Nobody should be required to leave. And it's interesting that while there have been allegations that people are going to be forced out, both the U.S. and the government of Israel has been very clear: Nobody's going to be forced out, at least not by the U.S. And Israel has said it doesn't plan to force people to leave, but it wants people to have the freedom to start over, make a new life away from Gaza and away from the horrific memories they have that were inflicted upon them.\"",
      "When asked about whether he supported a two-state solution \u2014 the long-standing U.S. policy toward the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 Huckabee said, \"It's really not an ambassador's position to make the decision of what that policy would be.\"",
      "\"It's sort of an aspirational goal: 'We need a two-state solution,'\" Huckabee said. \"But when you start asking people the specifics of what it looks like and where it's going to be. What are the boundaries? It's interesting that very few people have an answer for that.\"",

      "The United States and Russia have agreed on a meeting \"in the coming days\" between President Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said Thursday.",
      "Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said a place has been chosen and will be announced later and the two sides are working out details but are targeting next week for the session.",
      "The meeting would be their first since Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "The Kremlin announcement came after Mr. Trump said Wednesday there's a \"good chance\" he will meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon \u2014 as Mr. Trump presses Russia to end its three-year invasion of Ukraine.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that Russia suggested a meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin, and Mr. Trump is \"open\" to the idea of a meeting with both Russia and Ukraine's leaders.",
      "Asked hours later whether Putin and Zelenskyy had agreed to a summit, Mr. Trump told reporters \"there's a very good prospect that they will.\" He said it's not clear where the meeting would take place.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments came just before his Friday deadline for Russia to either strike a ceasefire deal with Ukraine or face sanctions. It wasn't clear how the announcement of the Trump-Putin meeting would affect that deadline.",
      "Putin met with Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow earlier Wednesday. The U.S. president called the hours-long meeting \"highly productive\" and wrote in a\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0post that \"great progress was made\" \u2014 a change of tone after Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Russia for much of last month.",
      "Ushakov said Thursday that Whitkoff mentioned the idea to Putin of a trilateral meeting of Putin, Mr. Trump, and Zelensky, but Moscow \"left this option completely, without comment.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also held a call Wednesday with European leaders and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "A senior Trump administration official told CBS News earlier Wednesday the meeting between Witkoff and Putin \"went well.\"",
      "\"The Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States,\" the official said.",
      "Asked about the Witkoff-Putin meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: \"We'll have some other discussions throughout the day, and then hopefully there'll be some announcements here fairly soon. Maybe positive, maybe not. We'll see.\"",
      "Zelensky on Thursday called for a face-to-face meeting with Putin to try to end the war, French news agency AFP reports.",
      "\"We in Ukraine have repeatedly said that finding real solutions can be truly effective at the level of leaders,\" Zelensky wrote on social media.",
      "He also said he spoke with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and that \"Europe must be a participant in the relevant processes.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same bold approach from the Russian side,\" Zelenskyy said. \"It is time to end the war. Thanks to everyone who helps!\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed both Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire, but he has oscillated between blaming Putin and Zelenskyy for a lack of progress. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has grown irritated with Putin over Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump demanded that Putin strike a ceasefire deal with Ukraine within 10 days, or Russia could face repercussions, including sanctions on Russia and countries that do business with it. That deadline runs out on Friday.",
      "\"The secondary sanctions are still expected to be implemented on Friday,\" the senior Trump administration official told CBS News following the Putin-Witkoff meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump has already begun targeting some Russian trading partners, slapping an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods Wednesday because the South Asian country continues to buy oil from Russia. That brings the total tax on Indian imports to 50%.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev \u2014 the deputy chair of Russia's security council \u2014 responded to Mr. Trump's sanction threats last week by warning: \"Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Medvedev's statement \"highly provocative\" and said he was ordering two submarines to be \"positioned in the appropriate regions\" in response.",
      "At other points, Mr. Trump has lashed out at Zelenskyy and accused him of prolonging Russia's invasion, which began in February 2022. He publicly argued with the Ukrainian leader in an Oval Office meeting, and in at least two cases, his administration has temporarily paused crucial U.S. military aid to Ukraine before restoring the shipments.",

      "On Aug. 6, 1945, the Enola Gay B-29 Superfortress bomber delivered its payload, dubbed Little Boy, onto the unsuspecting civilians of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb \u2014 nicknamed Fat Man \u2014 fell on Nagasaki. The bombing led to the Japanese official surrender in World War II on Sept. 2, 1945.",
      "By the end of 1945, about 210,000 people, mostly Japanese civilians and forced Korean laborers, had died. Some perished instantly in the blasts, others died later on from radiation poisoning. Pregnant women lost children in the aftermath, and thousands more civilians would fall victim to cancers and other side effects over the following decades.",
      "Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only two cities ever to be targeted by nuclear weapons. Tanaka, who was just 6 years old when the bomb fell, told CBS News in 2020 that both remain scarred by the horrors unleashed by President Harry S. Truman and the scientists of the Manhattan Project in the early hours of that quiet August morning.",
      "Bombing of Hiroshima",
      "In the wake of Little Boy's devastation, a\u00a0 stone building, five stories tall with blown-out windows and a crumbling roof, remained standing, despite its proximity to the bomb's hypocenter and the vaporization of everyone inside.",
      "Then known as the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the building was gutted by the blast, but its ashen steel dome, which shouldered the brunt of the overhead explosion, endured as a symbol of the city's resilience. Today, the structure is a part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial.",
      "The atomic detonation, and ensuing firestorm, destroyed or heavily damaged 60,000 buildings in Hiroshima\u2014two-thirds of the city's total structures. This image, taken by U.S. military reconnaissance, shows the city before and after the Enola Gay flew overhead.",
      "Three years after the bomb fell, Hiroshima still resembled a wasteland of crooked steel and charred rubble. This photo, dated 1948, shows how life was beginning to sprout from the desolation, with a handful of buildings dotting the ruined landscape.",
      "Today, Hiroshima is a booming metropolis of 1.2 million people\u2014nearly 3.5\u00a0 times larger than the city's estimated 1945 population of 350,000. After the bombing, the population had cratered to around 83,000.",

Still, 14,000 structures \u201427% of all buildings in the city\u2014 were destroyed when Fat Man detonated above Nagasaki. Only 12% of the regional capital's structures remained undamaged when the dust settled on the Southern Japanese island.",
      "By 1948, Nagasaki had been slow to recover. Temporary structures had started to emerge a year after the bombing, but citywide rebuilding wouldn't begin until the passage of the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law in 1949. Three years after nuclear weapons were deployed, charred tree trunks, stripped of their branches, stood near a sacred Torii Gate that survived the blast.",

      "The three females and one male were seen playing in their outdoor enclosure at Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Safari Park on Wednesday, enjoying themselves under the watchful eyes of their parents, Khalila and Bart. The cubs were born in early January and were first spotted out in the lion pavilion in April.",

      "Chances are that might not be the end of the story for the animal.",
      "Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Deputy Director Jaroslav Hyj\u00e1nek said that while preliminary steps have been taken for a possible reintroduction of the Barbary lion into its natural habitat, it's still a \"far distant future.\"",
      "The majestic member of the Northern lion subspecies, the Barbary lion once roamed freely its native northern Africa, including the Atlas Mountains.",
      "A symbol of strength, they were almost completely wiped out due to human activities. Many were killed by gladiators in Roman times, while overhunting and a loss of habitat contributed to their extinction later.",
      "The last known photo of a wild lion was taken in 1925, while the last individual was killed in 1942. It's believed the last small populations went extinct in the wild in the middle of the 1960s.",

      "Any reintroduction would face numerous bureaucratic and other obstacles. Since the lion has not been present in the environment for such a long time, the plans would have to ensure their protection, a sufficient prey population and cooperation and approval from local communities.",

    "story": [
      "A long-delayed and debated bridge linking the Italian mainland with Sicily cleared a major hurdle Wednesday, allowing work to begin on what would be the world's longest suspension bridge, despite concerns over earthquakes, environmental impacts and the threat of mafia interference.",
      "An interministerial committee with oversight of strategic public investments approved the 13.5 billion euro ($15.5 billion) project, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said the project will be \"an accelerator for development\" in southern Italy.",
      "Preliminary work could begin later this summer with construction expected to start next year and, French news agency AFP points out, projected completion in 2032.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge has been approved and canceled multiple times since the Italian government first solicited proposals in 1969 and was most recently revived by Premier Giorgia Meloni's administration in 2023. The notion of constructing a link between Sicily and the mainland dates back to ancient Rome.",
      "The decision marks a political victory for Salvini, who has made the realization of the bridge a hallmark of his tenure, saying it would be \"a revolution\" for southern Italy by bringing jobs and economic growth.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge would measure nearly 3.7 kilometers (2.3 miles), with the suspended span reaching 3.3 kilometers (some 2 miles), surpassing Canakkale Bridge in Turkey, currently the longest, by 1,277 meters (4,189 feet). With four lanes of traffic flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6,000 vehicles an hour and 200 trains a day.",
      "Controversy continuing",
      "AFP notes that some critics believe the span will never be built, pointing to a long history of public works announced and financed but still never finished in Italy.",
      "The project could provide a boost to Italy's commitment to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP targeted by NATO, as the government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defense-related, helping it to meet a 1.5% security component. Italy argues that the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment to NATO's southern flanks, qualifying it as a \"security-enhancing infrastructure.\"",
      "A group of more than 600 professors and researchers signed a letter earlier this summer opposing the military classification, noting that such a move would require additional assessments to see if it could withstand military use. Opponents also say the designation would potentially make the bridge a target.",
      "Environmental groups have lodged additional complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project will impact migratory birds, noting that environmental studies hadn't demonstrated that the project is a public imperative.",
      "The original government decree reactivating the bridge project included language giving the Interior Ministry control over anti-mafia measures. But Italy's president insisted that the project remain subject to anti-mafia legislation that applies to all large-scale infrastructure projects in Italy out of concerns that the ad-hoc arrangement would weaken controls.",
      "The project has been awarded to a consortium led by WeBuild, an Italian infrastructure group that initially won the bid to build the bridge in 2006 before the project was canceled in 2013. WeBuild constructed the Canakkale Bridge, which is currently the longest suspension bridge at 2 kilometers and 23 meters (about a mile and a quarter).",
      "The Canakkale Bridge, which opened in 2022, was built using the engineering model originally devised for the Messina Bridge, with a wing profile and a deck shape that resembles a fighter jet fuselage with openings to enable wind to pass through the structure, according to WeBuild.",
      "Addressing concerns about building the bridge over the Messina fault, which triggered a deadly quake in 1908, WeBuild has emphasized that suspension bridges are structurally less vulnerable to seismic forces. It noted that such bridges have been built in seismically active areas, including Japan, Turkey and California.",

      "In another commercial from the campaign, the \"Suddenly Susan\" star spoke to the camera and said, \"The secret of life lies hidden in the genetic code. Genes are fundamental in determining the characteristics of an individual and passing these characteristics on to succeeding generations. Occasionally, certain conditions produce a structural change in the genes, which will bring about the process of evolution.\"",
      "She went on to say this could occur by \"selective mating, in which a single gene type proves superior in transmitting its genes to future generations. Secondly by gene drift, in which certain genes may fade away\u00a0while other genes persist. And finally, by natural selection, which filters out those genes better equipped than others to endure in the environment. This may result in the origin of an entirely new species, which brings us to Calvins and the survival of the fittest.\"",

      "The new scam is giving parkers everywhere a major headache.",
      "By now, many of us have used QR codes as a way to quickly access menus, check into places, and make payments. But now, these convenient and contactless methods have become an easy target for cybercriminals. There has been a recent surge in \"quishing\" attacks, which are a form of phishing that uses QR codes instead of traditional methods like emails, text messages, and phone calls.",
      "Quishing is proving effective, too, with millions of people unknowingly opening malicious websites. In fact, 73% of Americans admit to scanning QR codes without checking if the source is legitimate. As experts warn, this growing trend could put people's personal information and money at risk.",

      "MULTIPLE US CANCER CENTERS HIT IN COORDINATED PHISHING BREACH",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of quishing is concerning",
      "NordVPN's security researchers report that fake QR codes have tricked over 26 million people into visiting malicious websites. These codes hide in plain sight, too. In one case, they were stuck on top of payment portals, sending unsuspecting individuals to sites meant to steal their personal and financial data (e.g., passwords and credit card information). Some even installed malware on people's phones.",
      "Even government agencies have taken notice. The FTC warned the public earlier this year that cybercriminals are now attaching harmful QR codes to packages and sending them to people. The New York City Department of Transportation issued warnings about fake QR codes appearing on parking meters of all places. Even Hawaii Electric chimed in, as they noticed scammers are using QR codes to steal payments.",
      "These tactics mirror the ATM skimmer scam, where criminals place keypads designed to log keystrokes over an ATM to steal card information. But with QR codes, this tampering is harder to spot and easier to implement.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "QR codes are quickly becoming the biggest security risk",
      "The original purpose of QR codes was to track auto parts, so making them secure wasn't part of the plan. Their widespread use today has made them irresistible to scammers. Unlike traditional phishing methods, they make it easy for cybercriminals to hide their destination until scanned, removing an important layer of user scrutiny.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers are leveraging this ambiguity to deploy Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and infiltrate personal devices, including military networks. More than 26% of malicious links now come via QR codes, according to KeepNet Labs, a cybersecurity company specializing in AI-driven phishing simulation and human risk management. Soon, quishing will outpace conventional phishing.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from quishing",
      "If you scan QR codes regularly, you might be panicking. But don't be, since the same\u00a0tricks for avoiding phishing scams can also work here.",
      "Pause and consider the origin of every QR code before you pull out your phone. Quishing thrives on people scanning codes found on public signage, restaurant tables, packages, or payment terminals without questioning their authenticity. Cybercriminals often cover genuine QR codes with malicious ones that redirect users to fake websites meant to steal personal and financial information. Always ask yourself: Do I trust this location or the person who provided this QR code? If in doubt, don't scan.",
      "Consider using a reputable personal data removal service. These services routinely scan the web for your personal details (like addresses, phone numbers, and emails), removing them from public databases where cybercriminals might collect information to personalize their quishing lures.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inspect the QR code's placement. Sophisticated scammers physically overlay fake QR codes on legitimate signs, especially on payment kiosks, parking meters, and package labels. If the QR code looks tampered with or is a sticker poorly placed over another code, avoid scanning it, as this is a common quishing tactic to redirect you to a malicious site.",
      "After scanning any QR code, double-check the URL before clicking through. One of quishing's dangers is that QR codes obscure their destination until scanned. If the web address looks suspicious, misspelled, unusually long, or filled with random characters, close the browser immediately. Never enter sensitive details like passwords or credit card information on a site you weren't expecting to visit.",
      "Install strong antivirus software across all your devices. Look for a solution that offers real-time protection, regularly updated threat databases, and built-in web protection. These tools can help detect malicious content hidden in QR codes and block dangerous websites that might automatically open after scanning. Since QR codes are increasingly used by cybercriminals to spread malware like Remote Access Trojans (RATs), having strong antivirus software in place is essential. To stay fully protected, make sure the software is set to update automatically and scan regularly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Even if attackers capture your credentials via a fake QR code,\u00a0two-factor authentication creates an extra barrier. Always activate 2FA on your accounts, especially for email, banking, and other sensitive services. It thwarts many of the most damaging results of phishing, including those initiated by QR code scans.",
      "Whenever possible, manually navigate to websites instead of using a QR code, especially for payments, reservations, or account access. Searching for an event, restaurant, or service online reduces the chance of being tricked by a malicious redirect or fraudulent site.",
      "Frequently update your phone's operating system and apps. Criminals often exploit software vulnerabilities, and manufacturers regularly issue security patches.\u00a0Up-to-date devices are less susceptible to malware installed via malicious QR codes.",
      "If you encounter what you believe to be a fraudulent QR code or fall victim to a quishing attempt, report it immediately to the organization involved and your local authorities or consumer protection agency. Your report helps others avoid similar attacks and keeps organizations alert to evolving scam tactics.",
      "By applying these steps, you make it significantly harder for cybercriminals to use QR codes as a gateway to your personal or financial information. In a world where 73% of Americans scan QR codes without checking the source, increased caution is your first and best line of defense against the quishing surge.",

      "DIOR DATA BREACH EXPOSES US CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Tea landing page. (Tea)",
      "What you need to know about the Tea data breach",
      "Tea launched in 2023 as a U.S.-based \"dating safety\" app for women, requiring verification via selfies and government-issued ID. The ID requirement was phased out later that year. The app gained viral momentum in July 2025, reaching the top of the U.S. App Store and accruing millions of users",
      "On July 25, users on 4chan discovered a publicly accessible Firebase storage bucket containing data of Tea users (via 404Media). A post reportedly exclaimed:\u00a0\"DRIVERS LICENSES AND FACE PICS! GET THE **** IN HERE BEFORE THEY SHUT IT DOWN!\"",
      "Tea later confirmed that the breach involved unauthorized access to a legacy database containing approximately 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and ID photos, and 59,000 images from posts, comments, and messages. These belonged to users who signed up before February 2024.",
      "Tea's leadership issued public statements confirming the image breach and claimed the data came from older systems not migrated to current secure infrastructure. Tea also stated that no email addresses or phone numbers were exposed and that only legacy users were affected.",
      "New revelations from independent researcher Kasra Rahjerdi and reporting by 404 Media showed that the breach extended far beyond images as approximately 1.1 million direct messages (DMs) spanning from early 2023 through July 2025 were also exposed. These included highly sensitive conversations about abortions, cheating, phone numbers, meeting info, and more.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In response, Tea disabled its DM system and took the affected messaging system offline. The company announced that it found no evidence of intrusion into other parts of its infrastructure.",
      "CyberGuy reached out to Tea for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.",
      "Tea app customer notice. (Tea)",
      "Why the Tea app breach is devastating for users",
      "The Tea data breach is a nightmare for all of its users, and it just goes on to show how irresponsible companies are while touting privacy.",
      "Tea positioned itself as a safe space for women to share intimate experiences and then failed at the single most important promise it made, which is protecting that intimacy.",
      "This wasn\u2019t just usernames or email addresses. We are talking about government IDs, selfies, and 1.1 million private DMs containing confessions, relationship details, and deeply personal topics like assault and abortions. That\u2019s the kind of breach you can\u2019t walk back. Once those images and conversations are out in the wild, they are effectively permanent.",
      "Tea wasn\u2019t a generic social app. It marketed itself as a \"dating safety\" platform for women, meaning users had a reasonable expectation of higher-than-standard privacy protections.",
      "These leaks hit a misogynistic forum first. Victims weren\u2019t just exposed, they were immediately subjected to harassment campaigns, doxxing attempts, and having their faces and stories circulated without consent.",

      "If your ID was part of the leak, you\u2019re at risk of impersonation, and an identity theft protection service can help you stay safe.

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft.",
      "Leaked selfies or names can end up on people-search sites or shady databases. A personal data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet.

      "Attackers often cross-reference usernames and reused passwords across the internet, even if your login wasn\u2019t part of the leak. Updating your passwords and enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication on all accounts is a basic but crucial defense. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

      "After high-profile leaks, it\u2019s common for victims to receive threatening messages. Don\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t click links. Report the message and block the sender. If you feel unsafe, contact local cybercrime authorities or a digital rights organization.",

If it were any other kind of app, this could still be contained. But one where people share sensitive information puts users in real danger.

    "summary": "Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
    "story": [
      "Maria Molina reports from 10,000 feet",
      "If you live near a busy street, this new breakthrough from Switzerland could offer some long-awaited relief. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
      "The new absorber is only about 2.1 inches thick, yet it performs on par with much bulkier products, such as rock wool. Even more impressively, it can be customized to target specific types of noise, making it ideal for a variety of indoor and outdoor settings.",

      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BIULT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Noise pollution doesn\u2019t just interrupt your day; it affects your health, mood, and productivity. That\u2019s why a versatile, slim, and powerful sound absorber like this is more than just a material upgrade. It\u2019s a lifestyle upgrade. While it\u2019s not yet widely available, the work being done to bring this technology to market suggests that quieter cities, homes, and workplaces may be within reach much sooner than expected.",

      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",

AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",

      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",

Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",

      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",

Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365.

      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If your organization uses on-premise SharePoint servers, take the following steps right away to reduce risk and limit potential damage:",
      "1. Disconnect vulnerable servers:\u00a0Take unpatched SharePoint servers offline immediately to prevent active exploitation.",
      "2. Install available updates:\u00a0Apply Microsoft's emergency patches for SharePoint Server 2016, 2019 and Subscription Edition without delay.",
      "3. Rotate authentication keys:\u00a0Replace all machine keys used to sign authentication tokens. These may have been stolen and can allow ongoing access even after patching.",
      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",
      "6. Review connected services: Audit access to Outlook, Teams and OneDrive for signs of suspicious behavior linked to the SharePoint breach.",
      "7. Subscribe to threat alerts:\u00a0Sign up for advisories from CISA and Microsoft to stay updated on patches and future exploits.",
      "8. Consider migration to the cloud: If possible, transition to SharePoint Online, which offers built-in security protection and automatic patching.",
      "9. Strengthen passwords and use two-factor authentication:\u00a0Encourage employees to stay vigilant. Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.

      "Facebook app on the home screen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The crackdown is part of a broader initiative \"to make Feed more relevant and help authentic creators break through,\" with Meta starting by \"cracking down on spammy content.\"",
      "In addition to the 10 million impersonator accounts, the company says it took action on around 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement. The company is also enforcing stricter policies to cut down on what it calls unoriginal content. It defines this as posts that repeatedly reuse or repurpose another creator's work without giving credit.",

      "Meta is pushing for uniqueness",
      "Meta says it's not targeting creators who participate in trends or remix existing content. What matters is whether they add something original to the mix. The company encourages reaction videos, commentary and other transformative uses of content.",
      "But accounts that repeatedly repost others' work without permission or meaningful changes will face consequences. These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

    "summary": "Meta removed over 600,000 predatory accounts from Instagram and Facebook while launching enhanced safety protections for teenage users on both platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson warns of a new scam targeting travelers and discusses Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing the company's 'personal superintelligence' plan.",
      "With the rise of social media use in children, many people, especially parents, are worried about their online safety.",
      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Meta's initiative aims to create a safer online environment in two ways. The first way targets accounts that display predatory behavior, and the second makes it easy for teens to spot and report suspicious activity.",
      "META AI\u2019S NEW CHATBOT RAISES PRIVACY ALARMS",
      "Teens can now see safety tips, block options and the account's join date. (Meta)",
      "Teens will now be safer on Meta platforms",
      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",
      "New block and report option in DMs. (Meta)",
      "Meta has removed thousands of predatory accounts",
      "In a transparent move, Meta revealed it had removed more than 600,000 accounts for predatory behavior across Instagram and Facebook. That is a staggeringly high number and just goes to show how much children were at risk.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",
      "Location Notice lets people know when they\u2019re chatting with someone who may be in a different country. (Meta)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent or a guardian, you can breathe a little sigh of relief that Meta is making great strides to make your child more digitally literate. If they understand how scammers operate, they become more resilient and masters of their online safety.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "However, it's still your responsibility to stay informed about what your teen is up to online. Use these updates as a chance to openly talk about online safety with your young ones, especially when it comes to reporting inappropriate content.",
      "Nudity protection feature. (Meta\u00a0)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Protecting teens online is a high priority, and it's great that Meta is showing a growing commitment toward this. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about. These updates and removal of accounts are just the beginning steps to creating a space where children feel safe. It's important to acknowledge that there will always be risks on these platforms, but giving teens the tools to fight back is extremely welcome.",

      "cry",
      "You might already know that Facebook\u2019s biggest strength isn\u2019t the social media platform itself, but the user data it collects.",
      "The data we hand over without thinking twice is what this multibillion-dollar company uses to generate revenue. It sells that data to advertisers, who then try to make money off you by showing ads in the hope that you\u2019ll buy their products. I\u2019ll admit, sometimes the ad platform can be beneficial by connecting small businesses to potential buyers.",
      "However, since Facebook allows almost anyone to advertise with minimal moderation, it often leads to dangerous scams. Security researchers have found that a persistent malvertising campaign is plaguing Facebook, leveraging the reputations of well-known cryptocurrency exchanges to lure victims into a maze of malware.",
      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "An iPhone with Facebook login screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",

      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

      "\"The irreparable injury to Plaintiffs is not merely theoretical,\" Parrish wrote. \"Based on the record in this case, the court notes once again its finding that the prosecution was brought in bad faith as part of a larger effort to harass Plaintiffs for their entheogenic religious practices and in hopes of giving the government a second opportunity to litigate the free-exercise issues presented squarely in this case.\"",
      "\"The prosecution has already caused Singularism to lose many of its practitioners and affiliates, and forcing Plaintiffs to wait until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings to secure their free-exercise rights would be the equivalent of issuing a death warrant for their nascent religion,\" the judge continued. \"For these reasons, the court grants Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an anti-suit injunction pending final judgment in this court enjoining further proceedings in the state criminal case against Mr. Jensen insofar as that case prosecutes him for violating the Utah Controlled Substances Act\u2019s prohibitions on psilocybin.\"",

      "\"Their observation, although correct, misses the point. The Free Exercise Clause is concerned not just with evenhandedness among religions but also evenhandedness between religion and nonreligion,\" Parrish wrote. \"A specific, secular exemption forpsilocybin without an accompanying religious exemption indicates that the law is not evenhanded as between religion and nonreligion because it \u2018prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that undermines the government\u2019s asserted interests in a similar way.\u2019\"",

      "Following a shooting that wounded five soldiers at Fort Stewart on Wednesday, a former public safety director at the Georgia military installation outlined the post\u2019s emergency response and weapons safety protocols, as officials praised fellow troops who tackled the suspect, likely preventing further casualties.",
      "Army Sgt. Quornelius Radford, 28, of Jacksonville, Florida, allegedly shot five fellow service members with a personal handgun in Fort Stewart's 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team area. They are all expected to recover, officials said.",
      "Ret. Army Col. Mike Bumgarner, who previously oversaw all emergency services and policing at Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, told Fox News Digital that military police would have arrived with multiple units within three to five minutes of receiving the 911 call.",
      "Also, likely aiding in the suspect's speedy apprehension, according to Bumgarner, were the FBI-style protocols soldiers are trained to follow, including quick evacuation, barricading if escape is not possible, and taking swift action to curb imminent danger.",

      "Soldiers living in the barracks cannot store weapons in their rooms, but those living in on-post family housing or off-post are allowed to keep personal firearms, provided they are registered with the fort's provost marshal, he said.",
      "And if leadership is concerned about a service member's stability, Bumgarner said the normal protocol is to ask the soldier to turn in their weapons for safekeeping. If the soldier declines, a commander will typically step in and order that the weapons be confiscated.",

      "Officials said the charges were unknown to Radford's chain of command.",
      "\"Something went wrong somewhere,\" Bumgarner said. \"Chaplains are very active in the United States Army, in every unit, down to very local level, so the chain of command is very attentive to any type of issues.",

      "Bumgarner said the Army's Criminal Investigation Division (CID), which is leading the investigation with possible support from the FBI, is likely already looking into which weapons were registered with the provost marshal and collecting interviews from anyone who may be involved.",
      "Commanders will also search for any links to terrorism, fanaticism or a larger issue involving more than one individual, according to Bumgarner. Other investigators will focus on the crime itself \u2014 preserving the crime scene, collecting evidence, and talking to associates who may have noticed something unusual.",
      "\"This is exceptionally rare, and I guarantee the community, the whole Army, is shocked by this,\" he said. \"It's just not something we see. The Army is very tight-knit.\"",
      "As for long-term weapon misuse prevention, Bumgarner said there is no quick fix.",
      "\"If you were around the military installation after 9/11, we did 100% vehicle checks, and I can recall sitting on the interstate backed up four miles,\" he said. \"Once you do it, it becomes a thorough search. Every compartment or container that [can] contain a handgun, you will be searching. You can sustain it for a period of time when a known threat is high, but [that would be] very hard and demanding on all the security, military police, as well as those that have to transit on and off post.",

      "\"So the issue comes to the weapon. How do we stop it? There is no quick, simple answer,\" Bumgarner added. \"Second Amendment rights are respected in the military as well. That's how they keep weapons in quarters. How do you preclude that? The military is a microcosm of our society.\"",

In August 2005, as part of Israel\u2019s\u00a0unilateral disengagement, the government forcibly removed approximately 8,600 Jewish residents from the area.",

Settlement in Gaza must, at the very least, be the price that reminds everyone terrorism does not pay.\"",

      "The Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) also recently released several photos of their own documenting a July 27 attack against the Christian village of Komanda in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Ituri province. Islamic State-affiliated soldiers opened fire at a Catholic Church and set fire to homes, stores, vehicles and possessions. At least 45 people were killed, according to MEMRI. The photos show burning facilities and the corpses of Christians.",
      "Fernandez explained to Fox News Digital that the goal of these jihadist groups is \"eliminating Christian communities,\" as they push down from safe havens and Muslims are \"given a choice: \u2018either join us or you too will face killing and annihilation.\u2019\"",

      "\"I'm no fan of the United Nations in general, but I think what they're doing is kind of the lowest common denominator,\" Fernandez told Fox News Digital. \"It's kind of easy to be vague like that.

    "story": [
      "Former Navy Capt. and Pentagon adviser Gene Moran said submarine positioning is \"rarely\" talked about, and Trump may have used a routine movement to a strategic advantage in announcing nuclear submarines would move toward Russia.",
      "Wednesday marks the 80th anniversary of when the U.S. employed the first ever nuclear bomb over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, followed by the bombing of Nagasaki three days later on Aug. 9. But despite nearly a century of lessons learned, nuclear warfare still remains a significant threat.",
      "\"This is the first time that the United States is facing down two nuclear peer adversaries \u2013 Russia and China,\" Rebeccah Heinrichs, nuclear expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Heinrichs explained that not only are Moscow and Beijing continuing to develop new nuclear capabilities and delivery systems, but they are increasingly collaborating with one another in direct opposition to the West, and more pointedly, the U.S.",
      "TRUMP LIFTS VEIL ON US SUBMARINES IN WARNING SHOT TO KREMLIN IN 'CLEVER' REPOSITIONING MOVE",
      "An aerial photograph of Hiroshima, Japan, shortly after the \"Little Boy\" atomic bomb was dropped in 1945. (Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty images)",
      "\"It\u2019s a much more complex nuclear threat environment than what the United States even had to contend with during the Cold War, where we just had one nuclear peer adversary in the Soviet Union,\" she said. \"In that regard, it's a serious problem, especially when both China and Russia are investing in nuclear capabilities and at the same time have revanchist goals.\"",
      "Despite the known immense devastation that would accompany an atomic war between two nuclear nations, concern has been growing that the threat of nuclear war is on the rise.",
      "The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u2013 which collectively killed some 200,000 people, not including the dozens of thousands who later died from radiation poisoning and cancer \u2013 have been attributed with bringing an end to World War II.",
      "But the bombs did more than end the deadliest war in human history \u2013 they forever changed military doctrine, sparked a nuclear arms race and cemented the concept of deterrence through the theory of mutually assured destruction.",
      "Earlier this year the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved forward the \"Doomsday Clock\" by one second \u2013 pushing it closer to \"midnight,\" or atomic meltdown, than ever before.",
      "In January, the board of scientists and security officials in charge of the 78-year-old clock, which is used to measure the threat level of nuclear warfare, said that moving the clock to 89 seconds to midnight \"signals that the world is on a course of unprecedented risk, and that continuing on the current path is a form of madness.\"",

      "Despite the escalated nuclear threats coming out of North Korea, and international concern over the Iranian nuclear program, the threat level largely came down to the three biggest players in the nuclear arena: Russia, the U.S. and China.",
      "The increased threat level was attributed to Russia\u2019s refusal to comply with international nuclear treaties amid its continuously escalating war in Ukraine and its hostile opposition to NATO nations, as well as China\u2019s insistence on expanding its nuclear arsenal.",
      "But the Bulletin, which was founded by scientists on the Manhattan Project in 1945 to inform the public of the dangers of atomic warfare, also said the U.S. has a role in the increased nuclear threat level.",
      "\"The U.S. has abdicated its role as a voice of caution. It seems inclined to expand its nuclear arsenal and adopt a posture that reinforces the belief that \u2018limited\u2019 use of nuclear weapons can be managed,\" the Bulletin said. \"Such misplaced confidence could have us stumble into a nuclear war.\"",
      "But Heinrichs countered the \"alarmist\" message and argued that deterrence remains a very real protectant against nuclear warfare, even as Russia increasingly threatens Western nations with atomic use.",
      "\"I do think that it's a serious threat. I don't think it's inevitable that we're sort of staring down nuclear Armageddon,\" she said.",

      "Heinrichs argued the chief threat is not the number of nuclear warheads a nation possesses, but in how they threaten to employ their capabilities.",
      "\"I think that whenever there is a threat of nuclear use, it's because adversaries, authoritarian countries, in particular Russia, is threatening to use nuclear weapons to invade another country. And that's where the greatest risk of deterrence failure is,\" she said. \"It's not because of the sheer number of nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Heinrichs said Russia is lowering the nuclear threshold by routinely threatening to employ nuclear weapons in a move to coerce Western nations to capitulate to their demands, as in the case of capturing territory in Ukraine and attempting to deny it NATO access.",
      "Instead, she argued that the U.S. and its allies need to improve their deterrence by not only staying on top of their capabilities but expanding their nuclear reach in regions like the Indo-Pacific.",

      "\"We also have nuclear weapons, and we have credible and proportional responses, and so they shouldn't go down that path,\" Heinrichs said. \"That's how we maintain the nuclear peace. That's how we deter conflict. And that's how we ensure that a nuclear weapon is not used.\"",

      "When much of the world had written off northern Gaza as unreachable, 30-year-old east-Jerusalem resident Sarah Awaidah and her team carved out a lifeline. Under the umbrella of Mena Aid, a regional partner coalition operating through the Multifaith Alliance (MFA), and in coordination with Israeli authorities, she built a system that moved hundreds of trucks of food and supplies into Gaza \u2013 bypassing Hamas and private contractors who had turned hunger into a business.",
      "The result: more than 100,000 families fed. The cost: her own safety. \"I never imagined that creating a safe, independent humanitarian route would become the reason my life might end,\" Sarah Awaidah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that took place in a safe house in Israel.",

      "Operating through Mena Aid, Awaidah\u2019s team designed an alternative route to deliver food and essential supplies.",
      "In Israel, a trusted logistics company transported the goods from the port of Ashdod to the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings. Inside Gaza, another logistics partner handled transport, while Awaidah\u2019s own staff \u2013 coordinating in real time with Israel \u2013 shadowed every shipment.",

      "\"Our teams are present during offloading and accompany the aid from the crossing to secure warehouses. Inside the warehouses, we begin distribution immediately \u2013 aiming to deliver everything the same day, and at most within two to three days. Nothing is allowed to sit idle.\"",
      "That level of control allowed them to achieve what few others could: reaching northern Gaza, where people had not seen a staple supply of food for months.",

Others try to take over the supply routes so they can resell it.\"",
      "According to Awaidah, her team\u2019s success threatened those who profit from scarcity. By flooding the market with free goods, they not only fed families but also drove down the inflated prices charged for basics like sugar and flour.",
      "\"If there\u2019s no sugar in Gaza, and we bring it in for free, they can\u2019t keep selling it at outrageous prices,\" she said. \"So we became their problem.\"",
      "Israeli authorities also tried to cut off these private-sector schemes by shutting down routes that allowed commercial profiteering. While this helped curb some corruption, it also made the remaining humanitarian channels more dangerous.",

      "\"The private sector was blocked, and so those who lost their profits started trying harder to threaten and infiltrate the humanitarian route,\" she said. \"They couldn\u2019t control it, so they tried to break it \u2013 and me.\"",

But I stood firm. I made sure he, and people like him, never got near it. And now, my life is at risk because I refused to let the private sector hijack aid for commercial gain, or let political actors bend it to serve their goals.\"",
      "Aid workers delivered food to Gazans in the northern part of the enclave last week. (Multifaith Alliance)",
      "For Awaidah, the families she helps are the reason she refuses to quit. \"We created a distribution model based on verified beneficiary lists, using ID checks to ensure fair and dignified access to food,\" she said. \"People stood in line calmly, organized, even in impossible conditions. That\u2019s something the media rarely shows \u2013 the dignity and patience of the people.\"",
      "In the past month alone, her group has delivered 75 trucks and has another 112 on the way from Ashdod. Each day, she focuses on the mission, even as the threats grow.",
      "\"What broke me most wasn\u2019t the threats from strangers \u2013 it was realizing that people close to me were part of it,\" she said. \"It\u2019s easier to fight enemies from the outside. But when it comes from your own circle, it cuts deeper. Still, that only confirms we\u2019re doing something right. If they\u2019re losing their minds over this, it means the mechanism we built works. It means it\u2019s secure.

      "For Awaidah, standing up to corruption has come at a steep personal cost. But for the families in Gaza who have stood in her food lines, she has already changed what once felt impossible: getting a fair share of help, without a price tag.",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday demanded that the CEO of the tech firm Intel resign immediately, saying he is \u201chighly conflicted\u201d because of alleged ties to China.",
      "\u201cThere is no other solution to this problem,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Trump\u2019s attack on the Intel chief is his latest attempt to pressure the semiconductor industry, which has fueled the boom in artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, he said he would hit imported computer chips with a 100% tariff unless companies are making them, or plan to make them, in the United States.",
      "The demand also comes after Sen. Tom Cotton wrote to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary to \u201cexpress concerns about the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security.\u201d",
      "Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, claims in the letter that Intel\u2019s recently named CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, \u201creportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army.\u201d",
      "Cotton asked Intel whether it had asked Tan to \u201cdivest from his positions in semiconductor firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party or the People\u2019s Liberation Army and any other concerning entities in China that could pose a conflict of interest?\u201d",
      "Cotton also asked the company if it was aware of any subpoenas that Tan\u2019s former firm received and if Tan has disclosed any other ties to China.",
      "Intel has not responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on Cotton\u2019s letter and Trump\u2019s social media post.",
      "The senator\u2019s letter cites a recent Reuters story that said Tan \u201chas invested in hundreds of Chinese tech firms, including at least eight with links to the People\u2019s Liberation Army, according to a Reuters review of Chinese and U.S. corporate filings.\"",
      "In March, Yeary announced that Tan had been named Intel CEO. Tan started working at the company on March 18. Tan was previously chief executive of Cadence Design Systems, an American chip design company based in California, from 2009 to 2021.",
      "Intel\u2019s rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Nvidia have all announced plans to invest  billions of dollars in their existing U.S. chipmaking infrastructure or deepen partnerships with U.S. companies like Apple to dodge those long-promised tariffs.",
      "Further management turmoil for Intel likely spells more trouble and delays as it continues to try to play catch up with its competitors. The company's stock market value, just shy of $90 billion, lags far behind most of its rivals. Its stock dropped more than 2% Thursday, erasing its gains for the year and underperforming the S&P 500's 9% gain this year.",
      "Intel\u2019s last CEO, Patrick Gelsinger, was forced out at the end of 2024 after the company fell behind Nvidia, AMD and other chip firms in the AI race. That came as Gelsinger sought to transform the long-struggling company by attempting to build major chip factories in the U.S.",
      "But Intel\u2019s debt load and the lead time that other companies already had on Intel were too much for Gelsinger to overcome.",
      "In November, Intel received a nearly $8 billion grant under the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cCHIPS Act\u201d for factory build-outs and to make secure chips for the Defense Department.",
      "But that grant was less than Intel was originally set to receive. It was reduced because U.S. officials worried about Intel\u2019s ability to deliver what was promised, The New York Times reported."

      "The order will not have any impact on the detention center's activity regarding immigration policy enforcement, Williams said.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are not asking this court nor would this court enter an order that would stop immigration efforts,\" she added.",
      "The hearing comes after environmental groups sued in June to stop the facility, which opened in July on an airstrip located in the sensitive wetlands of Ochopee\u2019s Big Cypress National Preserve, from operating.",
      "The suit claimed the center was built without mandatory ecological reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act, without public notice or comment, and the government failed to comply with other state and federal statutes, including the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Judge Williams had a heated exchange with defense attorneys for the state of Florida and the administration of President Donald Trump over their clients being unwilling to halt construction.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to find out when I wake up on Monday that the site has been altered when this is going on, that should not be a concern,\u201d Williams said in court Thursday. She made it clear that the plaintiffs were not trying to shut down the site, just to halt any construction ongoing there, which she called a \"reasonable request.\"",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be further construction there\u2019s going to be further hearing,\u201d Williams said.",
      "The construction of the site \u2014which came as part of the Trump administration's cracking down on immigration \u2014 was hotly protested by environmental groups and Native Americans, as the Everglades is a unique, marshy habitat home to endangered and threatened species.",
      "Christopher McVoy, an Everglades expert, environmental scientist, and board member of Friends of the Everglades \u2014 an Everglades preservation nonprofit and one of the parties who filed the suit, testified Thursday.",
      "He said he visited the detention center site on June 28, when an incident commander showed him around and told him they were paving some areas. McVoy described photos of the area since construction on the facility began and said, \"You\u2019re looking at 11 acres of new pavement.\" He also described an increase in traffic in the area.",
      "Dillon Reio, a professional geologist in Florida who works for SCS engineers providing assessments of development projects, said his assessment of the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" plans showed it lacked \"a cohesive storm water plan for the site,\" while warning that runoff can create contaminants, and \u201cthere could be offsite impacts.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Eve Samples, the executive director of Friends of the Everglades, testified that more than 40,000 people made submissions on its website to oppose the detention center.",
      "Samples testified that the group is concerned about the potential impacts of run-off, the industrial-style lights that are visible from 15 miles away despite a dark sky designation, and increased traffic.",
      "\"Driving out there myself many times, the increased traffic is visible. I saw two dead gators last time I visited, so definitely a difference in the area,\" she told the court.",
      "Jessica Namath, daughter of former NFL star Joe Namath \u2014 who was in attendance \u2014 also testified Wednesday. Namath, also a member of Friends of the Everglades, said that the detention facility has created light pollution and that the area looks \u201cheartbreakingly different.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d has faced other legal action for alleged inhumane conditions and treatment of detainees.",
      "The conditions were described as horrific by legal advocates and relatives of immigrant detainees, including cage-like units, mosquito infestations, and unsanitary conditions. NBC Miami has also reported on detainees\u2019 and family members\u2019 allegations of \u201cinhumane conditions\u201c: limited access to showers, spoiled food, and extreme heat.",
      "Civil rights lawyers last month sought a temporary restraining order against the facility, claiming constitutional rights violations, alleging detainees have been prevented from meeting attorneys and are being held without charges."

This attempt to manipulate the census data was stopped in court in 2020, and if he follows through with this authoritarian proposal, it will be stopped again.\u201d",
      "Trump has long pondered the question of citizenship as it relates to the census. During his first administration, he sought to have a citizenship question on the 2020 census, but was shot down by the Supreme Court.",
      "At the time, the Trump administration planned to include all people in the U.S. in the census regardless of citizenship. But Trump and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also planned to ask whether respondents to the census were citizens of the U.S.",
      "Independent analyses, including by the Census Bureau at the time, found that millions of people could go uncounted if they were presented with a citizenship question on the census.",
      "In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government has the right to ask about citizenship on the census, but that the administration did not properly justify why it hoped to change the long-standing practice of not including the question in the census.",
      "Afterward, Trump sought to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census, and he was buoyed by the Supreme Court's dismissal of a challenge to that plan in December 2020. Although the decision would have allowed Trump to move forward with the plan, the subsequent swearing-in of Joe Biden as president prevented him  from implementing it.",
      "Other questions about the census \u2014 including whether it should be conducted by random sampling or by a direct count \u2014 have long plagued presidential administrations confronted with the task of counting every person in the U.S. every 10 years.",
      "Though the next presidential administration would be in charge of administering the 2030 census, the Trump administration would still oversee the beginning of the process, including a determination about what questions would be asked.",
      "According to the Census Bureau, federal statutes require the agency to notify Congress of general census subjects three years before the decennial count, and of the actual questions to be asked two years before the count."

      "The Democrats face a $500 fine for each day they're \"absent without leave,\" a rule put into place after Democratic legislators mounted a similar effort to deny the Legislature a quorum in 2021, plus a \"pro rata share\" of what the state House Sergeant at Arms spends in their efforts to compel them to return to the Capitol in Austin.",
      "Those fines have already eclipsed the $600 monthly salary the lawmakers receive from their part-time elected posts. And given their meager salaries, and the fact that the Legislature only meets for regular session for six months every two years, virtually every state lawmaker has a day job they've left behind in Texas, too.",

      "Financing the quorum break",
      "Texas Democrats haven't been clear about how much money they've raised for their efforts. Wu told NBC News that on the first day they announced their quorum break they raised about $20,000 in small-dollar donations.",
      "After Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker helped strike a deal with Texas Democratic leaders to take refuge in Illinois during the quorum break, speculation grew that Pritzker, a billionaire Democrat, was financially underwriting the efforts. Pritzker said more than once during press conferences this week that was not the case.",
      "\"I made clear to them that we would do everything logistically and otherwise to try to support them. I have not written a check or supported them financially, though I am not reticent to do that,\" Pritzker said. \"I have not done that but lots and lots of people around the country have.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he would nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to fill the open governor role at the Federal Reserve until the term expires in January.",
      "The position, which comes with a spot on the interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, comes after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler resigned early. Kugler\u2019s 14 year term did not expire until January but she was set to leave the post on Friday, saying she would return to Georgetown University as a professor this fall.",
      "\"It is my Great Honor to announce that I have chosen Dr. Stephen Miran, current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve in the just vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board until January 31, 2026,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement.\"",
      "The U.S. dollar index, which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of foreign currencies, immediately erased its gain for the day and turned lower on the announcement.",
      "Kugler, a Biden appointee, had voted recently along with the majority of the committee to keep interest rates unchanged amid uncertainty from Trump\u2019s global tariffs and inflation that has remained above the Fed\u2019s 2% target and ticked up slightly in recent months.",
      "Miran would become the third Trump nominee to join the Federal Reserve, after Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman. Although Trump has attacked Powell on a near-constant basis since even before returning to office in January and has urged him to lower interest rates through insult-laden social media posts, Bowman\u2019s overall agenda as vice chair more closely aligns with the Trump administration.",
      "Powell does not have the power to unilaterally raise or lower interest rates. Only when a majority of the 12 member rate-setting committee votes to do so are rates changed.",
      "Miran is a key architect of President Trump\u2019s tariff war, after writing a paper in November last year called \u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System,\u201d which argued that trade deficits with other countries disadvantaged U.S. manufacturing and allowed China to accelerate its exports to the rest of the world.",
      "His paper floated the idea of \u201csweeping tariffs\u201d to narrow trade gaps, but admitted that reigniting global demand for U.S. exports could involve significant economic and market volatility.",
      "And in a suggestion that could raise questions about his independence as a potential Federal Reserve Governor, Miran wrote that balancing trade deficits would require a weakening of the U.S. dollar through \u201cgradualism or coordination with allies or the Federal Reserve.\u201d",
      "As President Trump has continued to bash the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, former Fed Chairs have been quick to warn that Fed policies made for political purposes tend to result in bad economic outcomes.",
      "\"He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled \u2014 He will do an outstanding job,\" Trump said on social media.",
      "In 2024, Miran co-authored a paper that was highly critical of the Federal Reserve that he is now set to join. \"The Federal Reserve\u2019s record in recent years raises questions about whether it has been operating in line with the best practices of central bank independence,\" Miran wrote.",
      "In the paper last year Miran echoed many of Trump's current lines of attack against the central bank. \"Important benefits flow from a central bank that can conduct monetary policy free from short-term political pressures\u2014and that to enable the Fed to do so, its governance should be overhauled. ,\" he said.",
      "Fears have been raised and markets roiled amid fears that Trump could fire chair Powell, although he does not have the power to do so except \u201cfor cause.\u201d The administration seized on the billion-dollar renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters in recent weeks, which some viewed as a possible way to fire Powell.",
      "However, Powell has firmly maintained that there has been no impropriety associated with the cost overruns of the renovation project.",
      "Bowman, a former Kansas banking regulator, was confirmed by the Senate as vice chair in June 2025. She has spent her tenure so far scaling back regulations that big banks and financial institutions have called onerous and costly. Bowman has said the previous regulatory approach was too complex and has called for changing key rules about how much capital big banks need to keep on their balance sheets in case of a financial crisis.",
      "Both Powell and Bowman have strongly maintained that the independence of the Fed is important for the future of the institution and the smooth operation of financial markets and the nation\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important, and I\u2019ve said this a number of times in the past, that we maintain our independence with respect to monetary policy. I think that\u2019s very clear,\u201d Bowman told CNBC on June 22.",
      "Speaking at the most recent Fed press conference, Powell said \u201cI think that having an independent central bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well. And, as long as it serves the public well, it should continue and be respected.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "MIAMI \u2014 A Florida judge ruled to temporarily halt operations at \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" the controversial migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades over a lawsuit alleging the site's construction skirted environmental laws.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams made the decision on Thursday after two days of testimony in Miami federal court.",
      "Any new construction must be halted for the next 14 days, starting Thursday, the judge said in her ruling. The court will now be on break until Tuesday.",
      "Williams later clarified that this ruling halts activities including \u201cat the very least, filling, paving, installation of additional infrastructure\u201d and also said no additional lighting fixtures should be added.",
      "The order will not have any impact on the detention center's activity regarding immigration policy enforcement, Williams said.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are not asking this court nor would this court enter an order that would stop immigration efforts,\" she added.",
      "The hearing comes after environmental groups sued in June to stop the facility, which opened in July on an airstrip located in the sensitive wetlands of Ochopee\u2019s Big Cypress National Preserve, from operating.",
      "The suit claimed the center was built without mandatory ecological reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act, without public notice or comment, and the government failed to comply with other state and federal statutes, including the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Judge Williams had a heated exchange with defense attorneys for the state of Florida and the administration of President Donald Trump over their clients being unwilling to halt construction.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to find out when I wake up on Monday that the site has been altered when this is going on, that should not be a concern,\u201d Williams said in court Thursday. She made it clear that the plaintiffs were not trying to shut down the site, just to halt any construction ongoing there, which she called a \"reasonable request.\"",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be further construction there\u2019s going to be further hearing,\u201d Williams said.",
      "The construction of the site \u2014which came as part of the Trump administration's cracking down on immigration \u2014 was hotly protested by environmental groups and Native Americans, as the Everglades is a unique, marshy habitat home to endangered and threatened species.",
      "Christopher McVoy, an Everglades expert, environmental scientist, and board member of Friends of the Everglades \u2014 an Everglades preservation nonprofit and one of the parties who filed the suit, testified Thursday.",
      "He said he visited the detention center site on June 28, when an incident commander showed him around and told him they were paving some areas. McVoy described photos of the area since construction on the facility began and said, \"You\u2019re looking at 11 acres of new pavement.\" He also described an increase in traffic in the area.",
      "Dillon Reio, a professional geologist in Florida who works for SCS engineers providing assessments of development projects, said his assessment of the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" plans showed it lacked \"a cohesive storm water plan for the site,\" while warning that runoff can create contaminants, and \u201cthere could be offsite impacts.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Eve Samples, the executive director of Friends of the Everglades, testified that more than 40,000 people made submissions on its website to oppose the detention center.",
      "Samples testified that the group is concerned about the potential impacts of run-off, the industrial-style lights that are visible from 15 miles away despite a dark sky designation, and increased traffic.",
      "\"Driving out there myself many times, the increased traffic is visible. I saw two dead gators last time I visited, so definitely a difference in the area,\" she told the court.",
      "Jessica Namath, daughter of former NFL star Joe Namath \u2014 who was in attendance \u2014 also testified Wednesday. Namath, also a member of Friends of the Everglades, said that the detention facility has created light pollution and that the area looks \u201cheartbreakingly different.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d has faced other legal action for alleged inhumane conditions and treatment of detainees.",
      "The conditions were described as horrific by legal advocates and relatives of immigrant detainees, including cage-like units, mosquito infestations, and unsanitary conditions. NBC Miami has also reported on detainees\u2019 and family members\u2019 allegations of \u201cinhumane conditions\u201c: limited access to showers, spoiled food, and extreme heat.",
      "Civil rights lawyers last month sought a temporary restraining order against the facility, claiming constitutional rights violations, alleging detainees have been prevented from meeting attorneys and are being held without charges."

      "From city subways to Southern cookouts to Midwestern music festivals, mini portable fans have rapidly become summer mainstays to mitigate the sweltering heat.",
      "While the gadget (and the weather) may be hot, experts say the reasons for the popularity are not: climate change and fast fashion.",
      "Long popular in humid climates like Asian countries, the mini blasters have proliferated in the West thanks to TikTok and platforms like Amazon, Shein and Temu.",
      "As fast fashion has grown, so too have fast accessories, experts say.",
      "Typically under $10 \u2014 the price of a faux leather belt, plastic sunglasses or synthetic jewelry \u2014 the battery- or USB-powered personal fan comes in a variety of styles: Users can wear it around their necks, install it in their car and even clip it on their handbag to accompany their prized Labubu.",
      "The rapid growth of affordable accessories at online retailers like Temu and Shein, where fans cost as little as $4, is a selling point particularly for cash-strapped Gen Z buyers, said Sheng Lu, an assistant professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "\u201cThe bigger picture behind the portable fan boom is how the popularity of fast fashion is spreading to accessories today,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of affordability and accessibility that facilitates expansion in the market.\u201d",
      "The price could increase at the end of the month with the end of a tariff exemption for lower-cost goods coming into the U.S.",
      "The global personal fan market is set to surpass $1 billion by 2033, nearly doubling its current value, according to market research firms. In the U.K., consumers bought 7 million portable mini fans in the past year.",
      "Google searches for portable fans have increased steadily over the past decade, peaking in June as intense heat waves blanketed the central and eastern U.S. The states with the highest search interest in the last three months are all in the sweltering South: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, among others.",
      "On TikTok, \u201cportable fans\u201d is the third most used hashtag for videos in the \u201cTech & Electronics\u201d category, most popular in Malaysia, then in the U.S.",
      "On social media overall, images and videos of the product seem inescapable. And the rise of mini fans is demonstrating how climate might be influencing fast-fashion trends, said Tracie Tung, associate professor of fashion design and merchandising at California State University, Northridge.",
      "\u201cThis is not a new invention,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they\u2019re just designed as a fashion piece.\u201d",
      "Some influencers have leveraged the trend to launch their own brands. Remi Bader, who has more than 2 million followers on TikTok, released a stylish new fan last year that clips onto a phone and comes equipped with selfie lights."

      "As dozens of Texas state House Democrats near the one-week mark of their quorum break, fleeing the state indefinitely to prevent state GOP leaders from redrawing congressional lines, it's not just politics that loom over the strategy. It's money, too.",
      "The Democrats face a $500 fine for each day they're \"absent without leave,\" a rule put into place after Democratic legislators mounted a similar effort to deny the Legislature a quorum in 2021, plus a \"pro rata share\" of what the state House Sergeant at Arms spends in their efforts to compel them to return to the Capitol in Austin.",
      "Those fines have already eclipsed the $600 monthly salary the lawmakers receive from their part-time elected posts. And given their meager salaries, and the fact that the Legislature only meets for regular session for six months every two years, virtually every state lawmaker has a day job they've left behind in Texas, too.",
      "Those monetary factors, plus the realities of being far away from family and other obligations, further complicate the plan for Democrats who have fled their home state to deny Republicans the requisite number of lawmakers needed to move forward with business in the Legislature.",
      "It\u2019s all why state Democrats have been fundraising around their quorum break, why other Democrats have been lending a hand \u2014 and why Republicans have been targeting their funding.",
      "\"There\u2019s people who are single moms, single dads, with their kids, and we just do what we can. None of this is fun,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, the leader of the state House Democratic Caucus, told NBC News.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been away from our families for six months already, right?\" Wu continued, a reference to the six month legislative session that started in January. \"During the special session, I can\u2019t work. Most people can\u2019t work. They\u2019re away from their families. ... All of us are making actual, real sacrifices to be here.\"",
      "State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer said when it came to financial support, he believed most members felt comfortable, but if anyone didn\u2019t, the rest of the members would have their backs.",
      "\u201cBecause of the bond we have with this, if any member was in need of anything \u2014 there are a lot of camp counselors around, like I\u2019m one of the camp counselors \u2014 we\u2019re all going to help each other, and we\u2019re not gonna leave anybody behind, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he said.",
      "State Rep. Armando Walle, who represents a Houston-area district, was one of two Texas House members to come to Boston \u2014 not only to break quorum but to attend the National Conference of State Legislatures annual summit, where he felt he could spread the word.",
      "He left Boston for Chicago on Wednesday alongside fellow state Rep. Ana Hernandez, where they plan to stay \u201cas long as this special session lasts\u201d \u2014 raising questions about how long he and the others can sustain lost wages and income.",
      "But Walle, who owns a small civil law firm, said he has continued to see clients and attend hearings virtually, allowing him to continue making a living while not being physically present at his office and in the Harris County courts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not independently wealthy,\u201d Walle told NBC News on the sidelines of the state legislatures summit. \u201cBut I have clients that are right now accommodating. They understand the situation. Our judges, as well.\u201d",
      "Financing the quorum break",
      "Texas Democrats haven't been clear about how much money they've raised for their efforts. Wu told NBC News that on the first day they announced their quorum break they raised about $20,000 in small-dollar donations.",
      "After Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker helped strike a deal with Texas Democratic leaders to take refuge in Illinois during the quorum break, speculation grew that Pritzker, a billionaire Democrat, was financially underwriting the efforts. Pritzker said more than once during press conferences this week that was not the case.",
      "\"I made clear to them that we would do everything logistically and otherwise to try to support them. I have not written a check or supported them financially, though I am not reticent to do that,\" Pritzker said. \"I have not done that but lots and lots of people around the country have.\u201d",
      "Former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke built a potent fundraising machine during a run for Senate in 2018, and his political group, Powered by People, has been raising money to support the Texas Democrats. O'Rourke told CNN during a Wednesday interview the money was going to \"make sure they have the resources for their lodging, their food, their flights\" as well as their legal defense.",
      "That disclosure prompted state Attorney General Ken Paxton to announce he was investigating O'Rourke's group over that funding, which he called \"illegal bribes.\" (Paxton is running for Senate in 2026, and O\u2019Rourke has not ruled out a Senate bid of his own.)",
      "\"Any Democrat coward breaking the law by taking a Beto Bribe will be held accountable,\" Paxton said in a statement.",
      "In a statement responding to that investigation, O'Rourke invoked the Texas state House's impeachment of the attorney general in 2023. Paxton was later acquitted in the state Senate.",
      "\"The guy impeached for bribery is going after the folks trying to stop the theft of five congressional seats,\" O'Rourke said. \"Let's stop these thugs before they steal our country.\"",
      "No matter how the fundraising efforts go, eventually, something has to give. Walle, the Texas lawmaker who traveled from Boston to Chicago this week to continue breaking quorum, acknowledged to NBC News that the group's decampment from Texas couldn\u2019t go on forever.",
      "But he also wouldn\u2019t commit to an end date or a firm or specific end goal, saying only he wanted to continue \u201craising awareness\u201d and would likely remain out of state through the current special session.",
      "\u201cBeyond that, we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there,\u201d he said."

I\u2019m following all their rules,\u201d Mendoza M\u00e9ndez, a 45-year-old Mexican immigrant, said in a video call with Noticias Telemundo from the Freeborn County Correctional Facility in Minnesota.",
      "In 2013, Mendoza M\u00e9ndez, who had crossed the border 13 years earlier, was the victim of a violent robbery in Minnesota, which was recorded and investigated by police. The type of assault he suffered is included in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) list of crimes that qualify for a U visa, a measure designed for victims of criminal acts in the U.S. who agree to help authorities investigate the crime.",

      "\u201cThe U visa is a humanitarian benefit, but it\u2019s also a law enforcement tool,\" explained Hannah Shapiro, supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society, which provides legal help to low-income families and individuals. \"It requires the individual to cooperate in an investigation or prosecution related to the visa-qualifying offenses, which can be recent or have occurred several years ago.\u201d",
      "She added the visa was designed to make communities safer by incentivizing undocumented survivors of domestic abuse and other crimes to contact police and cooperate in investigations, thus helping make abusers accountable.",
      "The U visa's benefits include the ability to live and work in the U.S. and a chance to apply for a green card in the future. However, as with other visas for victims of abuse and crime, such as the Special Immigrant Juvenile program, the U.S. government only grants 10,000 U visas per year, which has created a considerable backlog for applicants.",
      "There are more than 300,000 people waiting, in addition to qualifying family members, Shapiro explained, and the process can take up to 15 or 20 years.",
      "According to USCIS numbers, the government received 266,293 primary U visa applications from fiscal year 2017 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.",
      "\u201cThis means that if all U visa applications were halted today, it would take more than 20 years to resolve the pending cases. Since fiscal year 2009, USCIS has seen a 2013% increase in pending cases,\u201d USCIS said in a statement sent to Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Since June 2021, USCIS has been granting \u201cgood faith determinations\u201d \u2014 official documents that validate the legitimacy of the U visa application and protects applicants from deportation while giving them work authorization.",
      "Recent changes, fewer protections",
      "Immigration experts and attorneys say the Trump administration is now asserting that \u201cgood faith determinations\u201d do not protect people from deportation, leading to detentions of U visa applicants.",
      "\u201cI always carried in my wallet the letter of good faith that ICE had approved for me, which states that I have the right to be in the United States without fear of deportation. But the agents told me they were no longer respecting that. And they took me away,\u201d said Mendoza M\u00e9ndez.",
      "Matthew J. Tragesser, chief of USCIS' Office of Public Affairs, said in a statement to Noticias Telemundo that \u201ca good faith determination on a pending application for U nonimmigrant status does not protect a foreign national from immigration enforcement.\u201d",
      "Tragesser also stated that \u201cthe U visa program is being exploited by foreign scammers and criminals, their corrupt lawyers, and law enforcement officers,\u201d though he did not provide specific figures or cases.",
      "Last month, USCIS announced that five Louisiana men, including four active and retired law enforcement officers, had been  charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit visa fraud and mail fraud following a federal investigation that uncovered a pattern of inconsistencies in U visa applications. According to the agency, the defendants filed false police reports so that foreign nationals who were supposedly victims of the thefts could apply for U visas.",
      "A shift away from victims' protections",
      "Although the fundamental structure of the U visa program remains intact (since it was created by Congress, it can't be unilaterally eliminated), several experts and applicants say its practical implementation has become significantly harder.",
      "\u201cShortly after Trump returned to power, they repealed a memorandum that considered victim status a discretionary factor that, except in extenuating or more serious circumstances, should not be a priority for removal. This is even true if their case was pending and had not been approved,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "The attorney refers to Memorandum 11005.4, which changed the agency\u2019s approach to immigration enforcement related to U visa applicants. Among other things, this new directive eliminates proactive victim identification, so ICE officers are no longer required to look for clues or evidence suggesting a foreign national is a victim of a crime when making enforcement decisions.",
      "\u201cWith the new Department of Homeland Security rules, these cases are being reopened. So people who were helping the police, who had suffered some type of crime, or were victims of a very serious crime are now in deportation proceedings,\u201d immigration attorney Benjam\u00edn Osorio said.",
      "One such case is that of Fredy Hern\u00e1ndez Cedillos, a Salvadoran immigrant who has lived in the U.S. since 2009. He was injured during a violent robbery in Virginia in 2010 and has been waiting for a U visa since 2020.",
      "\"My lawyer received a letter from DHS saying they\u2019re going to reopen our case, even though we\u2019ve already gone to court. So our fear is that we can\u2019t return to our country because gangs are after us. And we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll have to leave our children,\u201d said  Cedillos.",
      "U.S. law allows migrants applying for this visa to continue the visa  process in the countries to which they were deported. However, lawyers like Osorio warn of the difficulties involved in this process.",
      "\u201cYes, they can continue their procedures. But the problem is that if the waiting list is more than 10 years long, people have to spend that time in the country to which they were deported, and they are often in danger there. Furthermore, if they have American children, they will suffer without their parents, because deportation affects the entire family,\u201d Osorio said.",
      "'Harmed by these delays'",
      "The prosecution of these cases made headlines in January, when a Michigan court ruled that a group of crime survivors applying for U visas could move forward with a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for unjustifiable delays in receiving initial good faith determinations, which, among other things, has prevented them from accessing work permits.",
      "\"We have several clients who have waited nearly six years without any updates or news, not even an initial acknowledgment of the legitimacy of their case. The court ruled that our clients have been harmed by these delays,\u201d Meredith Luneack, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, said in a statement. This case is still being reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.",
      "The Trump administration has demanded a drastic increase in the immigrant detentions and deportations, with a daily quota of 3,000 arrests. Shapiro, along with other experts, says this pressure has resulted in hundreds of people being detained while attending their immigration court appearances.",
      "\"You want to do things right and work in this country, but what I see is that the government wants to remove as many people as possible. The fear is going to court and, once we\u2019re there, they won\u2019t let us out,\u201d Cedillos said.",
      "Mendoza M\u00e9ndez remains detained as he battles in court to stay  in the U.S. With a broken voice, he said he hasn\u2019t lost hope of returning to his family in Minnesota. \"I still have faith and I know we\u2019ll be able to get through all of this,\u201d he said.",

      "Afterward, Trump sought to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census, and he was buoyed by the Supreme Court's dismissal of a challenge to that plan in December 2020. Although the decision would have allowed Trump to move forward with the plan, the subsequent swearing-in of Joe Biden as president prevented him  from implementing it.",

      "MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. \u2014 At an event billed as the \u201cmother of all town halls,\u201d Rep. Nancy Mace, the latest Republican candidate for governor of South Carolina, said she\u2019d \u201cdebate anyone\u201d and \u201cgo into the lion\u2019s den\u201d \u2014 even as some who disagreed with her were asked to leave the venue.",
      "\u201cI like the debate. I like being asked tough questions,\u201d Mace told NBC News in an interview after the event, held in ruby-red Horry County. \u201cAnd you heard me from the podium with the microphone, I actually asked Democrats to speak up, ask your questions, because I don\u2019t fear any of the tough questions. That is democracy, and that\u2019s what our country should be about.\u201d",
      "But the crowd at the intimate, veteran-owned cafe was friendly. Mace\u2019s staff and volunteers handed out campaign signs and buttons at the door and asked several people who came in with signs and T-shirts reflecting their opposition to Mace, including someone wearing a \u201cLove is Love\u201d shirt, to leave before her remarks began.",
      "Kathi Hunt and her husband, David, made it into the venue, but told NBC News they felt pressured to leave after not clapping or cheering Mace during her remarks. \u201cI didn\u2019t clap and I booed something, and the woman in front of me turned around and said, \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019\u201d Kathi Hunt, an independent, said.",
      "David Hunt, who is a Democrat, said he had an \u201coverwhelming sense\u201d they\u2019d be kicked out of the event for not clapping alongside the other attendees, so they left.",
      "Asked about her team telling people to leave, Mace, who last held a town hall in her district in April, said she heard some protesters inside the venue calling her supporters \u201ca four-letter word, see you next Tuesday\u201d but that she was not aware that others were pressured to exit the cafe.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see that at all,\u201d Mace said. \u201cAnd if I had seen an incident happen, I would have stopped, paused and made sure that everything was kosher and OK, because the last thing I want anybody to feel is not feel welcome.\u201d",
      "The South Carolina congresswoman said everyone has a right to attend her events, but intimidation and name-calling is where she draws the line.",
      "\u201cEveryone has a First Amendment right to be here. I will answer any questions. Republican, Democrat, independent, you can come to these events,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re public events, but what we\u2019re not going to do is have people that intimidate other individuals, that call them really horrific names, where people don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d",
      "Mace is no stranger to name-calling, repeatedly and unapologetically using a derogatory term for transgender people on her X account online and in official committee hearings at the Capitol. She did not use the term during Wednesday\u2019s event, but she overwhelmingly focused on culture war issues, primarily targeting transgender Americans and vowing to pull funds from colleges and universities \u201cthat can\u2019t define what a woman is.\u201d",
      "Speaking to NBC News after the event, Mace called herself \u201cTrump in high heels\u201d and touted her close relationship with the president. She also said she supports his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files that have caused a rift among the base, even after she voted in the House Oversight Committee last month to require the Justice Department to release the files.",
      "Mace said she will also sign on to a bipartisan effort to force a vote on the House floor on releasing the files when Congress returns in September. Pressed why the Republican-led House needs to force the Republican administration\u2019s hand on the Epstein issue, Mace said, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like \u2026 that is how the House works.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m someone who\u2019s worked and fought very hard to protect women and children, and I will always do that,\u201d Mace argued.",
      "Mace wouldn\u2019t say whether she has confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi, instead saying she has confidence \u201cin the process.\u201d",
      "The loudest applause Mace got all night was for her promise to \u201cmake sure that child rapists get the death penalty.\u201d She believes that\u2019s \u201creflective of the Epstein issue\u201d because there is a \u201cclass of people that get away with everything,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI know this just as well as anybody else, given the trauma that I went through two years ago and seeing the way that I was treated in the system,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf I was treated that way, how\u2019s everybody else treated?\u201d",
      "In February, Mace gave a 50-minute floor speech accusing four men of rape, sex trafficking and other sex crimes against her and other women. In the speech, she also accused Republican Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is now one of her opponents in the gubernatorial race, of deliberately delaying and failing to prosecute the men. An accusation that Wilson said is \u201ccategorically false.\u201d",
      "Asked why she began her campaign tour in Myrtle Beach, Mace replied: \u201cWhen it comes to the MAGA voters, the conservative base, those who supported Donald Trump, this is when you get the sense of the vibe of where those voters are at \u2014 it\u2019s right here, and they\u2019re a bellwether for the rest of the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re in a Republican primary, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, and we\u2019ll travel all around the state, to every single county who will have us,\u201d Mace said."

      "The company said the new model, GPT-5, is its smartest and fastest to date with wide-ranging improvements to ChatGPT\u2019s skills in areas like coding, writing and taking on complex actions.",
      "The model has been eagerly anticipated by technologists as a leap forward in AI capabilities and a step toward the kind of superintelligent systems that almost every major technology company is now racing to build. OpenAI along with Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon and others have already plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into AI investment, with some projections of future spending reaching into the trillions.",
      "But GPT-5\u2019s new abilities appear to be largely refinements to features that ChatGPT and other AI systems already have. A spokesperson told NBC News that there are still \u201ckey limitations in areas like persistent memory, autonomy, and adaptability across tasks.\u201d",
      "GPT-5, which was unveiled to the public during a live streamed event on Thursday, is free for everyone. But users in paid tiers will get higher usage limits, as well as access to GPT-5 Pro.",
      "During a media briefing prior to launch on Wednesday, Altman said he believes the new model is so smart that going back to its predecessor GPT-4, which launched in 2023, feels \u201cquite miserable\u201d in comparison.",
      "\u201cIt reminds me of when the iPhone went from those giant-pixel old ones to the retina display, and then I went back to using one of those big pixelated things,\u201d Altman said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe how bad we had it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Starting Thursday, ChatGPT users will also be able to choose a custom color for chats, pick from a selection of pre-set personalities and connect their ChatGPT to Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Contacts.",
      "GPT-5 comes as OpenAI looks to find an edge in the global AI race that has pushed tech companies to roll out sweeping advancements in recent years, with full support from their respective governments. As generative and \"agentic\" (AI that can autonomously take actions on a user's behalf) AI tools grow ever more sophisticated, they\u2019ve been met with a mix of excitement and ethical concerns across industries.",
      "The world has seen rapid technological advancements since ChatGPT launched to the public in November 2022, when it was powered by GPT-3.5, and kicked off the generative AI boom that now dominates Silicon Valley.",
      "ChatGPT boasts over 700 million users. Today, powerful large language models are integrated into everything from regular chatbots to agentic assistants and photorealistic video generators.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s stream, OpenAI shared that GPT-5 set a new high on the SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark that ranks models on their software engineering capabilities.",
      "OpenAI's post-training lead, Yann Dubois, said the model opens up \u201ca whole new world of vibe coding,\u201d or the ability for noncoders to create fully deployable websites and apps just by describing what they want to build and letting an AI agent do the work.",
      "Altman said he believes GPT-5\u2019s ability to \u201cinstantaneously create an entire piece of computer software for you\u201d will likely be a core part of its appeal and use.",
      "\u201cI think this idea of software on demand will be a defining part of the new GPT-5 era,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier this summer, Altman compared contemporary AI agents to an \u201cintern that can work for a couple of hours.\u201d He went on to predict that \u201cat some point, it\u2019ll be like an experienced software engineer that can work for days.\u201d Such tools have already begun to displace white-collar jobs, rousing distress from job seekers.",
      "GPT-5 dropped amid an already buzzy week for AI companies. OpenAI had just released two new open-weight models, or models that other developers can download and use for free, on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, Anthropic dropped Claude Opus 4.1, an upgrade to its powerful Opus 4 model, and Google released its interactive world simulation model Genie 3.",
      "Nick Turley, OpenAI\u2019s head of ChatGPT, said the company is confident GPT-5 will be more accurate and produce fewer hallucinations, a term for false or misleading information that AI models present as fact. He said the company has made significant improvements on toning down sycophancy, a problem that has plagued ChatGPT in the past.",
      "The AI giant recently rolled back an update to GPT-4o that made the bot so overly agreeable that it praised users to the point of sounding disingenuous, and even went so far as to endorse and give instructions for terrorism. Just this week, OpenAI also added guardrails to make its models refrain from giving direct advice about personal challenges.",
      "GPT-5 went through 5,000 hours of red teaming, or expert-led safety testing, according to the company\u2019s safety research lead, Alex Beutel. Beutel added that the model will be less deceptive than previous versions, meaning it should be less likely to lie to users about things like completing a task it hadn\u2019t actually completed.",
      "OpenAI also developed a new method, which it dubbed \u201csafe completions,\u201d to prevent people from trying to get around safety guardrails by tailoring their questions in ways that trick the model into aiding in a harmful request.",
      "\u201cSo if someone [asks] how much energy is needed to ignite some specific material, that could be an adversary trying to get around the safety protections and cause harm, or it could be a student asking a science question to understand the physics of this material,\u201d Beutel said. \u201cAnd this creates a real challenge. What\u2019s the best way for the model to reply?\u201d",
      "In the past, ChatGPT would either respond or refuse to respond based on whether it thinks the question is safe to answer. GPT-5, however, will take a new approach: Rather than choosing between compliance and refusal, it will try to always \u201cgive as helpful an answer as possible, but within the constraints of remaining safe.\u201d",
      "Online, there\u2019s been some buzz around what GPT-5 will reveal about humanity\u2019s ability to achieve \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d or AGI, a hypothetical benchmark at which point AI will be fully capable of doing any intellectual task that a human can.",
      "Altman, who has been vocal about his optimism for the potential to reach AGI, said GPT-5 isn\u2019t there just yet. While the model is generally highly intelligent, he said, it\u2019s still missing a key ability to learn continuously without being retrained.",
      "\u201cBut the level of intelligence here, the level of capability, it feels like a huge improvement,\u201d Altman said. \u201cAnd certainly, if I could go back five years before GPT-3 and tell me we have this now, I\u2019d be like, \u2018That\u2019s a significant fraction of the way to something very AGI-like.\u2019\u201d"

      "It comes after Ivy League universities Columbia and Brown last month reached settlements that require them to release information about applicants\u2019 race in addition to test scores and academic performance after they went back and forth with the Trump administration for months over federal funding. The settlements have stoked debates about academic freedom and the role of government institutions in higher education.",
      "The president's directive comes more than two years after the Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action programs at the University of North Carolina and Harvard, ruling that the consideration of race in the admissions process violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Conservative activists, who argued that the policy led to discrimination against white and Asian students, considered the rulings a major victory.",
      "The rulings, however, were heavily criticized by those who argued that race-conscious admissions provided an avenue for students from marginalized communities to combat historical racial discrimination in the higher education system.",

      "Brian Znotins, American\u2019s senior vice president of network and schedule planning, told CNBC that the airline saw high numbers of customers from Argentina travel to Doha, Qatar, during the 2022 World Cup and that he expects even more to travel to the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.",

      "\u201cWe took a fresh look at where the demand hotspots are in Europe and we continue to see strength in Italy and Greece,\u201d Znotins said. \u201cWe continue to see high numbers of travelers connecting in Europe to get to places like Rome and Athens,\u201d so the airline is adding more options from U.S. hubs.",
      "With Prague and Budapest service from American\u2019s hub at Philadelphia International Airport, he said many customers already fly into one city and out of the other for Danube River cruises and other tours.",
      "American\u2019s unit revenue for domestic flights in the last quarter fell 6.4% from 2024, while trans-Atlantic revenue rose 5%.",
      "Many of American\u2019s summer routes were discontinued because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but Znotins said the changes weren\u2019t just a return to that period.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve redesigned the entire airline based on today\u2019s demand environment and not some desire to get back to 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything has changed.\u201d",
      "American will use Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners for all the new flights except for Zurich to Dallas, which will be flown by Boeing 777-200s.",

      "There are also lingering questions about Benson and Stabler\u2019s relationship status. While Meloni guest-starred last season in a scene to rough up a guy who approached Benson\u2019s son, one of Stabler\u2019s last big \u201cSVU\u201d moments with Benson happened when they almost kissed in her kitchen back in Season 24.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s her voice that he hears,\u201d he said.",

      "Since its July 21 release, the television series, based on the novel by May Cobb, has evolved into a cultural moment, racking up over 11 million views on Netflix, per Deadline.",
      "On TikTok, thousands of viewers are sharing their thoughts on show\u2019s roller coaster of twists and soap-level drama.",
      "Where did all this buzz come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the show's appeal and the phenomenon it sparked.",
      "What is \u2018The Hunting Wives\u2019 about?",
      "Originally created for Starz, the erotic thriller was acquired by Netflix.",
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" follows PR exec Sophie O\u2019Neil (Brittany Snow) as she moves from Boston to East Texas with her architect husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit). She immediately finds herself out of place in an inner circle of wealthy Southern housewives who call themselves the \"Hunting Wives.\"",
      "These women seemingly couldn't be more different from Sophie: Not only does the elite clique embrace gun culture, but also they also adopt an unabashed stay-at-home lifestyle that is foreign to her. When Sophie asks her new friends what they do for work, they emphasize that their job is to \u201cwife.\u201d",
      "Along with culture shock, Sophie grapples with her looming dark past through frequent flashbacks.",
      "Sophie eventually becomes enthralled by the group\u2019s queen bee, Margo Banks (Malin A\u030akerman), the wife of Graham\u2019s boss, Jed (Dermot Mulroney), an oil tycoon running for the governor of Texas. Margo takes Sophie under her wing, and their friendship quickly escalates into a steamy affair.",
      "A throughline of the show is its twisty murder plot. After local teenager Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, Sophie finds herself inconveniently tangled in the mystery. As the town searches for the culprit, its residents cultivate messy love triangles and secret relationships on the side.",
      "Why has 'The Hunting Wives' become such a phenomenon?",
      "Part of the appeal of the \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is that it goes there \u2014  all manner of daring places.",
      "Each character is shamelessly committed to making jaw-dropping decisions. Take, for example, Margo\u2019s affair with an 18-year-old high school student who also happens to be Abby\u2019s boyfriend. Or Sophie\u2019s decision to rashly secure a firearm, a choice that backfires after she blacks out on the night of Abby\u2019s death ... and her gun turns out to be the murder weapon.",
      "Then, of course, there are the show\u2019s multiple murders and frequent extramarital escapades.",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u2019 consistently prioritizes steamy scenes over sensible plotting or nuanced characters, juicy twists over deep emotions or big ideas. It might all be incredibly frustrating, if it were not also so wildly entertaining,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter writes of the show.",
      "The show\u2019s hype is not necessarily due to its quality: Some fans on Reddit point out, Margo\u2019s wig looks (perhaps purposefully) unrealistic, and there may be more than a few plot holes.",
      "Instead, the series\u2019 shock factor is what makes it bingeable.",
      "\u201cLook, it isn\u2019t Emmy award winning TV. The acting only ranges slightly fair. The characters are terrible people,\u201d one Reddit user writes. \u201cBut I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t sucked in from the very first episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything has been said regarding it being the perfect summer sleazy schlockfest we all love,\u201d another adds.",
      "In addition to its wild plot twists, the show\u2019s depiction of Margo and Sophie\u2019s queer relationship has led to chatter.",
      "Them, an LGBTQ+ publication, writes that \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d might be \u201cthe gayest show of the year.\" Many fans have posted their reactions to Margo and Sophie\u2019s relationship, crediting the show's suggestive scenes for their sexual awakenings or awkward watch moments with family members.",
      "\u201cWith all of the attention the show is receiving, viewer reactions have proved feverish, with fans across party lines gamely questioning their sexuality after witnessing Margo\u2019s effects on Sophie,\u201d NBC Out writes of this phenomenon.",
      "Watchers also have also found themselves enthralled by the series\u2019 political message.",

But, in actuality, it is such a scathing review of the hypocrisy of the nuclear family (and) God fearing Republicans,\u201d one reviewer theorizes on TikTok.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the show\u2019s most intriguing wrinkle involves incorporating just enough political references to feel like a satire of Southern-fried hypocrisy,\u201d Slate writes.",
      "This layer adds, for some, enough to turn the show from a beach read on screen to something a little deeper.",
      "However, not everyone is a fan \u2014 some criticize the show for being too vulgar or underdeveloped.",
      "But the show\u2019s blend of lustful romance, a messy murder plot and perhaps a bit of political humor is what has many fans knocking on Netflix\u2019s door for another salacious installment."

      "Mills said during his interview with Carey that Perry \"hasn't stopped talking about it since but it happened.\"",

      "\u201cMore likely, the team underestimated the reaction or saw it as a playful pun rather than a loaded phrase. Either way, the responsibility remains the same: if you spark a conversation, be prepared to own it and respond accordingly,\u201d she adds."

      "Creators are posting before and after makeover videos where they turn themselves into their idea of a city or region\u2019s ideal of beauty. The hope is to achieve a look that scores a \u201c10 out of 10\u201d on a scale of attractiveness.",
      "Some videos, which users post to the song \u201cCandy\u201d by Foxy Brown, have upwards of a million views, but commentators have mixed reactions to what the moment is trying to say.",
      "Why are people turning themselves into a (insert city here) 10?",
      "The \u201cturning myself into a 10\u201d trend references how beauty ideals vary by geographic region.",
      "Back in 2015, Vogue published an article defining \u201cNew York City vs. Los Angeles Beauty Rules.\u201d The conversation continued on social media. According to users on Reddit, a \u201cNew York 10\u201d might be \u201cmore high fashioned\u201d while a \u201cLA 10\u201d might be \u201cmore beachy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThinking about that element of how beauty is attached to a particular place is not new,\u201d Katherine Phelps, a gender and women\u2019s studies professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Now, users of a primarily female demographic post style and makeup transformations online where they turn themselves into a place's version of a \u201c10.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so gendered. When we are talking about someone being a '10,' we\u2019re speaking from a place of that woman is deemed attractive by a man,\" Phelps adds.",
      "This moment for the trend is different because it covers a wider range of locations than the classic \"New York vs. LA\" debate. Users have created videos inspired by their experiences in places like Atlanta, Texas, France and Kansas \u2014 and yes, New York and Los Angeles.",
      "Some are spoofs on the idea of conventional beauty \u2014 one version of a Colorado 10, for example, is in athletic clothes and no makeup. Another idea of a New York 10 is having an apartment with amenities like a washing machine and garbage disposal. Others are saying they're a worldwide 10 \u2014 then dressing up as Mr. Worldwide, Pitbull.",
      "One user who participated in the trend is @maycietilley, who posted a video of herself turning into a \u201cUtah 7,\" as other users have done.",
      "\u201cThe beauty standard in Utah and its culture is very high, especially compared to other states,\u201d Tilley tells TODAY.com. \u201cI see people on FYP page all the time talking about how they can instantly tell when someone is from Utah or its culture because of how they look or dress.\u201d",
      "What does the trend say about beauty?",
      "Commentators have mixed opinions on what the viral moment says about beauty.",
      "Brand strategist Mara Dettman shared her perspective on the trend on her Substack, \"In Interesting Times.\" She wrote the idea of ranking someone based on attractiveness is \u201cinherently problematic.\u201d However, she also wrote that this trend takes ranking beauty and \u201cplays with it, critiques it, and perpetuates it, all at once.\u201d",
      "Dettmann tells TODAY.com this trend says anyone can be a \u201c10,\" as modern standards of beauty are defined by styling or charm and not physical traits.",
      "\u201cIt brings up really interesting questions about, when it comes to beauty: What\u2019s innate? What\u2019s performative?\u201d Dettmann says.",
      "Phelps also notes that the trend is nuanced.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always sort of a dangerous thing when we\u2019re ranking humans, and when we are creating hierarchies around bodies,\u201d Phelps said.",
      "She also touches on the agency and performance involved in this trend \u2014 people are bringing a cheeky self-awareness to beauty standards.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s less about how people embody a particular beauty standard and more so how they construct it, how they make it happen,\u201d Phelps adds.",
      "Dettmann says the regional aspect of the trend marks a shift away from one singular standard of beauty, best represented by Instagram face, the theory that all influencers and celebrities are starting to look the same due to similar cosmetic treatments.",
      "\u201cEven in the age of people being chronically online, regional culture and differences still matter,\u201d Dettmann says. \u201cIn a sea of sameness, we\u2019re getting more similar in some ways but also retaining unique differences.\u201d",
      "Additionally, some users who make fun of the trend reject the ranking mindset, Dettmann adds, by asking \u201cwhy do you even want to be a 10?\u201d",
      "TikToker Sam Puckett, for example, posted a video of herself transforming into her idea of a \"Texas 10 \"\u2014 the beaver mascot for the beloved Southern chain Buc-ees.",
      "\u201cYou can make anything or anyone a 10 if you fully commit and have the confidence,\u201d Puckett tells TODAY.com. \"My 10 for the trend is the Buc-ees Beaver and let me tell you he is getting hyped up in the comments.\u201d",
      "Phelps adds that humorous approaches make a statement on the idea of ranking beauty.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve found great about this as well is the way people are immediately putting humor into it and are responding in ways that are funny, resistant,\u201d Phelps says. \u201cThey\u2019re contradicting the trend at the same time that they\u2019re doing it.\u201d"

      "Savannah Guthrie asked her on TODAY on Aug. 7 what she could divulge about the series after it was reported in April that the film was becoming a show on Peacock.",
      "\"Not much,\" she said before laughing. \"I\u2019m really excited about it. I think we\u2019re going to try really hard. The goal is to make it honor what everyone loves about \u2018Clueless\u2019 and Cher.\"",
      "\"So we want to honor that, but also bring something fresh and new to it,\" she continued. \"I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll be able to do that, but we\u2019re in baby stages right now.\"",

      "\u201cBack to the Future\u201d owns the box office, spending its first three weeks after its July 3 release as the No. 1 movie in America before slipping to second, only to begin another eight weeks in the top spot after that.",
      "But there\u2019s an actor in another Michael J. Fox flick who hits it big that August with two movies.",
      "On Aug. 9, \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d came out, with Mark Holton playing Francis, the man-child who steals Pee-wee Herman\u2019s bike, sparking Pee-wee\u2019s hilariously surreal road trip to find it. Two weeks later, on Aug. 23, \u201cTeen Wolf,\u201d a comedy with Fox portraying an average teen who must come to terms with the fact he\u2019s a werewolf, was released. Holton played Chubby, one of the teammates on his high school basketball team.",
      "Holton quickly realized that \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d was going to be a smash when he went to the film\u2019s premiere \u2014 which aired on MTV \u2014 at Mann\u2019s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, an event that featured his own interactions with a cavalcade of \u201880s stars, including Rodney Dangerfield, Alice Cooper, Mr. T and David Lee Roth.",
      "\u201cThat was a crazy, crazy night for me because, first of all, I thought, \u2018This film has legs. This is great,\u2019\u201d he tells TODAY.com in a phone interview. \u201cAnd then just even back then, before the internet, with just television and radio, it was just carpet-bombed with ads.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat movie got huge laughs. It was a really electrifying screening,\u201d Paul Reubens, who created and played the Pee-wee character, said in the 2025 HBO documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself.\u201d",
      "The movie reportedly cost between $6 million and $7 million to make and would go on to earn $40 million, the kind of success no one saw coming.",
      "\u201cWhat it was called at the time was a \u2018sleeper hit,\u2019 which meant that it was a surprise to people, including Warner Bros., that people liked it. And people really liked it,\u201d said Reubens, who died in 2023.",
      "Moviegoers certainly really liked Francis, a role Holton says he got after he did a reading of the famous \u201cI know you are, but what am I\u201d scene with Reubens.",
      "\u201cBy the time I made it back to my apartment and checked my machine, my agent said, \u2018Call us,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cI call them, and they\u2019d already booked me on the film. I went, \u2018Really? Well, OK, when do we start?\u2019 It was just kind of magic right from the start, and here we are, 40 years later, the magic just keeps coming.\u201d",
      "The film turned the Pee-wee Herman character into a full-blown sensation, ushering in what Reubens called in the HBO documentary \u201cPee-wee mania.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a moment in the \u201880s that wasn\u2019t really super cool to be me,\u201d Reubens said.",
      "Holton speaks well of the experience of making the movie, calling the production \u201ca well-oiled machine.\u201d He also gushes about \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d and what it was like working with Fox, who helped round out Holton\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cHe was a lot of fun, just a hoot and a half,\u201d he says of Fox.",
      "\u201cMike and I just hit it off so much that he started making suggestions,\u201d he adds. \u201c\u2018Well, why don\u2019t we have Chubby do this, Chubby do that?\u2019 And all of a sudden, Chubby kind of morphed into the player that was the total underdog with the hook shots and all that stuff. And I absolutely loved it. And then by the end of the film, they\u2019re lifting me on top of their arms and carrying me off the court. So it was pretty trippy.\u201d",
      "\u201cTeen Wolf\u201d has carved its own fan base over the years among those who saw it in theaters or on countless airings on cable \u2014 heck, even LeBron James has chimed in about it. It spawned a sequel (starring Jason Bateman) and a Saturday morning cartoon and was adapted into MTV\u2019s much darker dramatic series in 2011, which itself would lead to a 2023 movie on Paramount+.",
      "\u201cTeen Wolf\u201d seemed like a footnote ahead of its release, but Holton was excited for it after Fox became a huge star in \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d generating further interest in \u201cTeen Wolf.\u201d",
      "\u201cI figure, \u2018Well, this is going to keep it riding the coattails of this film and Michael J. Fox\u2019s megastardom.\u2019 Yeah, it was encouraging to have the wind of sails when it hit your back, so to speak,\u201d he says.",
      "When it comes to \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d and \u201cTeen Wolf,\u201d Holton doesn\u2019t prefer one over the other \u2014 \u201cI enjoy them for different reasons,\u201d he says \u2014 but both roles mean something to him.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t pick a winner looking back in hindsight. They were both wonderful experiences,\u201d he says about the films.",
      "The summer of 1985 helped shape the course of Holton\u2019s career. He would go on to have a small but memorable role in 1988\u2019s \u201cThe Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\u201d and star alongside an unknown actor named Jennifer Aniston in the 1993 cult classic \u201cLeprechaun.\u201d",
      "After \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d and \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d came out, he was on his way.",
      "\u201cIt was just kind of like back to the grindstone of beating on doors and dealing with rejection, but a lot farther along \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize it at the time \u2014 than I was before that summer,\u201d he says.",
      "The public has certainly not forgotten Holton. He appears at conventions and is amazed at the response he has gotten from fans.",
      "\u201cI had no idea the love waiting for me out there. The stories, people walking up and saying, \u2018During COVID, this film helped me keep my sanity. I would watch it every day, and it was the only thing, the bright spot in my life for months,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cYou meet people, they come up and say, \u2018Can I have a hug?\u2019 \u2018Well, yeah, come here. You need a hug?\u2019 And they\u2019ll say, \u2018My dad just passed away,\u2019 or something like that. So, yeah, I have a real connection to the people that come in,\u201d he adds."

      "Although Season 1 and the current season highlighted the seemingly unbreakable bond between the five ladies as they tackled London\u2019s high society in the 1870s, the episodes leading up to the Season 2 finale hinted that tension between a couple of them would boil over. Prior to Nan\u2019s grand masquerade ball to mark the end of the season, she confronts Lizzy about a secret she has been keeping.",

      "In the finale, Mabel approaches Conchita with an idea at the party. She points out that flirting isn\u2019t easy \u201cfor people like me\u201d and that it is a struggle to find others like herself in rigid high society. Mabel says she wants to show gay men and women that love is possible. So, she suggests that she work with Conchita to turn her matchmaking operation into a business that brings gay people together.

But Lizzy says she will always choose her friend over him. Nan rejects this, adding that Lizzy hasn\u2019t been thinking about her the whole time.",
      "Lizzy then pushes back, accusing Nan of being sanctimonious, given that she was in a love triangle with Theo and Guy, his best friend. Nan counters that Lizzy isn\u2019t who the world thinks she is and everyone deserves to know \u201cthe truth\u201d before storming off.",

      "\u201cI think I was always sort of slightly pushing for him to have maybe a darker side or a slightly more sinister edge. I think just because (of) the nature of his job and the nature of ambition and the nature of wanting to be in power,\u201d he says.",
      "But he says he understands Hector\u2019s actions.",

      "Ibrag tells TODAY.com that she agrees with that assessment of Hector\u2019s character. \u201cI feel like it came from a place of almost a wound,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe\u2019s not a malicious person \u2026 not like a Seadown.\u201d",

She becomes emotional as she worries Theo and his mom will take her baby. Patti and her come up with a plan: to publicly announce her pregnancy at the ball to catch Theo off guard and prevent his family from excluding her.",
      "But Theo is also plotting. At the ball, he asks Lizzy to not give up on him and says he is concocting a plan. When midnight arrives, he interrupts Nan\u2019s big moment to make a declaration of his own.",
      "He confirms that he and Nan have been living \u201ca lie\u201d for the last few months and that he does not love her. He says he wants to celebrate his true love, not keep it hidden.",

      "Lizzy chases after her and the two argue again. Nan wonders how their friendship crumbled. She yells at Lizzy before letting it slip that she is pregnant. She asks Lizzy to keep her secret. Nan wishes Lizzy good luck lying to Theo and runs off. The last shot of the season shows Nan fleeing down the beach with a smile on her face.",
      "Fr\u00f8seth tells TODAY.com how she interprets Nan\u2019s feelings at that moment.",

      "She continues, \u201cI\u2019m very excited to see where she is going to go and how she\u2019s going to raise this child. Is she going to go back? I really hope she stays by herself.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00f8seth says she joked with Hendricks that the two could raise Nan\u2019s baby in the countryside. Fr\u00f8seth then shares what she hopes to see from her character in a potential Season 3.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m being serious. I actually think that she should be by herself, and I was really proud of her when she made that decision,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really courageous decision to leave things behind, but I think things have gotten so toxic within the friendships, within the men. There\u2019s so much happening and she\u2019s been making a lot of sacrifices and too many impulsive decisions. It\u2019s just time to get away.\u201d",
      "Who Is Theo\u2019s Brother?",

      "The unusual public outrage was set off by videos widely shared on Chinese social media showing a group of teenage girls verbally and physically attacking the victim in Jiangyou, a city in Sichuan province.",
      "Local residents, some of whom were spurred by what authorities said were false reports that the families of the alleged attackers had official ties, have faced off with police they accuse of letting them off too lightly.",
      "\u201cYour children will meet children of officials who are more senior than you. What if they beat your children?\u201d one man said from behind a barricade in a video verified by NBC News.",
      "Other verified videos, many of which were swiftly taken down by Chinese censors, showed a large crowd gathered in Jiangyou on Monday night, at times singing the Chinese national anthem as the police presence grew. Some people could be seen struggling with police officers on the ground before being taken away.",
      "Reached by phone on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Sichuan Public Security Department declined to comment and referred to earlier statements.",
      "According to local police in Jiangyou, the incident took place on July 22, when a 15-year-old girl surnamed Liu and two others, ages 13 and 14, assaulted the 14-year-old victim, surnamed Lai, in a vacant building. Bystanders recorded the incident and uploaded it online, police said in a statement Monday.",
      "The assault caused multiple contusions to Lai\u2019s scalp and knees, police said, though all injuries were \u201cminor.\u201d Following investigation, authorities \u201cpromptly\u201d expressed sympathy for the victim and took action, the statement said.",

Under Chinese law, anyone who engages in severe group fighting can be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 1,000 yuan  ($139), but juvenile offenders are exempted from detention and sent for corrective education instead.",
      "Cyber police in the city of Mianyang, which administers Jiangyou, said in a statement Tuesday that the parents of the three alleged attackers were not lawyers or police officers, but that \u201ctwo are unemployed, two work outside the province, one is a local shop assistant, and one is a local food delivery worker.\u201d",
      "They said two internet users accused of posting the false information had been \u201cadministratively punished.\u201d",
      "The attack has been widely discussed on Chinese social media, where commenters expressed anger over what they considered relatively light penalties.",
      "\u201cOnly a heavy penalty can serve as a warning,\u201d one user wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cThis is really abhorrent.\u201d",

      "The issue of bullying has been getting more attention in China after several high-profile cases.",
      "In January, violent protests erupted in the northwestern province of Shaanxi over a teenage student who fell to his death at a vocational school after a \u201cverbal and physical altercation\u201d with another student. Investigators ruled out any crime.",
      "Last December, a Chinese court in the northern province of Hebei sentenced one teenager to life imprisonment and another to 12 years over the murder of their 13-year-old schoolmate, who was buried in an abandoned greenhouse after being killed by a shovel.",
      "A third suspect, who like the others was 13 at the time of the crime, was sentenced to corrective education.",
      "Chinese authorities acknowledge that some minors take advantage of the lower penalties generally available to those under 16 and commit multiple offenses before that age, state-run broadcaster CCTV News reported in June.",
      "The country\u2019s top legislature passed an amendment the same month that would allow minors ages 14 to 16 to be detained over \u201cserious and harmful\u201d offenses starting next year."

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to push to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip\" as ceasefire talks with Hamas founder and the hunger crisis in the besieged Palestinian enclave spirals.",
      "A bid by Netanyahu to occupy all of Gaza would follow similar calls from members of his far-right government upon whom his fragile coalition relies, and could mark a significant shift in policy since Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005.",
      "Officials from Netanyahu's office said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday night that the Israeli leader had decided to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip, including areas where hostages may be held.\"",
      "The statement was shared in Hebrew and the term used can be translated to mean both \"occupy\" and \"conquer.\" Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on the intended definition, but Israeli media, including The Times of Israel, reported that Netanyahu intended to \"fully occupy\" the enclave.",
      "Israeli media reported that Netanyahu would hold a limited security meeting Tuesday to discuss the future of Israel's campaign in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu had said Monday he planned to convene the security Cabinet this week to \"instruct\" the Israeli military on how to achieve the three war objectives laid out at the start of Israel's offensive in Gaza: defeating Hamas, seeing the release of hostages who remain held in the enclave and removing the threat of possible future attacks. Asked to confirm if the meeting would take place Tuesday, his office did not respond directly and referred NBC News to his comments Monday.",
      "While the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, that left 1,200 dead and saw 250 taken hostages garnered worldwide sympathy for Israel, the country's actions in the territory have since sparked widespread international outrage.",

      "There has been growing global alarm over Israel\u2019s actions in the enclave amid a hunger crisis caused by the offensive and strict restrictions on the entry of aid, marked by mounting deaths from starvation.",
      "The \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201c is unfolding in the Gaza Strip under Israel\u2019s assault, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger said last week. Meanwhile, most of its residents have been driven from their homes and more than 60,900 killed, including thousands of children, according to local health officials.",
      "Nearly 190 people in Gaza, including at least 94 children, have died from malnutrition since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "There is mounting opposition to the war among Israelis. Many have long despaired over the fate of of the estimated 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza, and recent protests have expressed outrage over the children dying from malnutrition.",
      "Fears for the hostages were also fueled after Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad released imagery in recent days showing visibly gaunt Israeli hostages Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski.",
      "Earlier this month, a group representing hundreds of retired Israeli security officials that calls itself the Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security\u2019s leadership addressed a letter to President Donald Trump calling on him to pressure Israel to end the war.",
      "In the letter, which was confirmed to NBC News, the group said it was its professional judgment that Hamas no longer posed a strategic threat \u2014 and that it was time to \u201cend the war, return the hostages\u201d and \u201cstop the suffering.\u201d",
      "While the reoccupation of Gaza is largely unpopular with the Israeli public, it is supported on the far right.",
      "Over the weekend, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza and to encourage Palestinians to leave the enclave.",
      "Ben-Gvir drew condemnation not only for his comments, but also for leading a group of worshippers in prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, violating a decades-old agreement allowing Jews to visit to Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site but not to worship there.",
      "Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza, and called for rebuilding of Israeli settlements there alongside other right-wing ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Israel captured the Gaza Strip, then occupied by Egypt, after the 1967 war, but withdrew settlers \u2014 some of them forcefully \u2014 in 2005. In 2006, residents elected the Islamist militant and political group Hamas in legislative elections, precipitating clashes with the more secular Palestinian faction of Fatah. Hamas seized full control of the enclave in 2007."

      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing instead is a curated, sanitized version of the country that conveniently erases the brutal realities faced by Afghan women under Taliban rule,\u201d Orzala told NBC News.",
      "The Taliban has effectively barred Afghan women from many aspects of public life, including access to education and jobs. In July, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two of the Taliban\u2019s top leaders, accusing them of persecuting women and girls in Afghanistan, which the group dismissed.",
      "Influencers continue to go to Afghanistan despite clear warnings from the U.S. State Department that Americans should not travel to the country \u201cfor any reason\u201d and that \u201cthere is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.\u201d",
      "The European Union and Britain have issued similar travel advisories, while none of these countries have operational embassies in Afghanistan, limiting the provision of consular assistance to citizens."

      "The U.S. and India\u2019s blossoming friendship is at risk of fracturing, observers have warned, as President Donald Trump threatens to substantially increase tariffs on Indian goods over its purchases of Russian oil.",
      "At the start of the year, India seemed to be one of the countries most likely to win Trump\u2019s favor, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China and Trump\u2019s close relationship with its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India; moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan; and mocked India\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d economy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In a sharp response, India, a major U.S. security partner, said such criticism was \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "U.S.-India tensions are mounting domestic political pressure on Modi, with opponents accusing him of failing to stand up to his \u201cdear friend\u201d Trump.",
      "\u201cThe country is now bearing the cost of Narendra Modi\u2019s \u2018friendship,\u2019\u201d the opposition Congress party said last week.",
      "\u2018I don\u2019t want you building in India\u2019",
      "It was a different picture in February, when Modi was among the first world leaders to visit the White House after Trump returned to office. Mirroring Trump, he said he too would \u201cmake India great again.\u201d",
      "The bonhomie did not last long. Since then, Trump has needled India over a number of issues, including billions in investment by American companies as they shift manufacturing from China.",
      "Last quarter, India produced 44% of U.S. smartphone imports, more than any other country, including China, according to data from the research firm Canalys. That includes iPhones sold in the U.S., the majority of which Apple chief executive Tim Cook says will have India as their country of origin starting this quarter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want you building in India,\u201d Trump said he told Cook in May, urging him to produce phones in the U.S. instead, despite the difficulties.",
      "Cozying up to India\u2019s foe",
      "A terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 26 people in April is another source of friction in U.S.-India relations.",
      "India responded by bombing neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of harboring terrorists, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries.",
      "Trump irked India by repeatedly claiming that he had personally brokered a ceasefire. While Islamabad thanked Trump for mediating, India rejected claims of U.S. involvement, including in a call between Modi and Trump.",
      "\u201cIndia has not endorsed Trump\u2019s claim,\u201d said Amitendu Palit, a former Indian finance ministry official and a senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cThat has not gone down very well with Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Within weeks, Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting. He has also imposed a lower tariff rate on Pakistan of 19% and said the U.S. had reached a deal with Pakistan on exploring its oil reserves.",
      "Squeezed over Russia",
      "As Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he has turned his attention to India\u2019s relationship with Moscow.",
      "For years, New Delhi has benefited from its \u201cnonaligned\u201d foreign policy, which allowed India to strengthen U.S. ties while continuing its long-standing relationship with Russia, one of its main suppliers of energy and military equipment.",
      "When Russian oil was hit with Western-led sanctions over Ukraine, India \u2014 the third-largest energy consumer in the world after China and the U.S. \u2014 seized the opportunity to buy it at a discount, which even U.S. officials said helped stabilize global oil prices.",
      "\u201cThey bought Russian oil because we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil,\u201d Eric Garcetti, the U.S. ambassador to India under President Joe Biden, said at a conference last year. \u201cIt was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity we didn\u2019t want oil prices going up.\u201d",
      "The U.S. position on India\u2019s oil purchases appears to have reversed under Trump, who said in a social media post last week that India and Russia \u201ccan take their dead economies down together.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are now at a stage where the American ability to control Russia and its allies is beginning to impact India,\u201d Palit said.",
      "Jaishankar said that while Trump\u2019s actions won\u2019t push India out of America\u2019s orbit, they could drive India to strengthen ties with other countries such as China. During a meeting of their foreign ministers in Beijing last month, India and China agreed to resume direct flights between their countries for the first time in five years.",
      "Despite the recent setbacks in their relationship, India will continue to engage with the U.S. as a key strategic and technological partner, said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a wake-up call of sorts,\u201d he said."

      "A lion that was being tracked by Oxford University researchers in western Zimbabwe has been killed by a trophy hunter, in what one wildlife campaigner called a \u2018harrowing echo\u2019 of Cecil the Lion\u2019s death in 2015.",
      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",
      "The beloved feline was killed in late June but his death only began to garner international attention in the last week.",
      "Some 10,000 lions have been shot by trophy hunters in the last decade, according to CBTH, which said African lion populations have declined by more than 90% in the last century.",
      "The safari company Africa Geographic sponsored the GPS collar that was fitted on Blondie.",
      "Africa Geographic\u2019s CEO, Simon Epsley, said the organization was \u201cdismayed and angered\u201d at the killing.",
      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",
      "Born Free, another U.K.-based advocacy group, has expressed concern for Blondie\u2019s pride, saying the fate of its three female partners and a number of cubs was \u201cseriously in doubt.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",
      "After the worldwide outrage caused by Cecil\u2019s killing, Zimbabwean authorities vowed to crack down on trophy hunting  \u2014 but pressure groups say it hasn\u2019t worked.",
      "Mark Jones, Born Free\u2019s head of policy, said that that little has been learned since Cecil\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cThe very fact that they lure lions out of national parks suggests that there are no lions remaining in the hunting areas for them to hunt, reflecting the massive damage to lion populations that trophy hunting is doing,\u201d Jones said."

    "story": [
      "After months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s comprehensive and sweeping tariffs slate took effect Thursday just after midnight ET, shifting his global trade reset into high gear.",
      "Most imports into the United States will now face a baseline 10% duty, with the overall average effective tariff rate rising to more than 17% \u2014 the highest since 1935, during the Great Depression \u2014 thanks to higher duties on some of the biggest U.S. trading partners, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.",
      "A wide variety of products will be hit. Tariffs will be collected on everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China and TVs from South Korea. Selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and a suite of goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected.",
      "Together, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.",
      "Trump was online to celebrate the moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.",
      "So far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Global markets largely shrugged off the new tariffs, with European and Asian shares mostly higher on Thursday, CNBC reported. U.S. stock futures were also up slightly.",
      "But Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending."

      "Residents and tourists in nearby areas were requested to remain in their homes unless told to evacuate. Two campgrounds were evacuated as a precaution.",
      "The prime minister met Wednesday afternoon with firefighters and residents at Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, where the fire service\u2019s command post has been set up. He said he came to express \u201cnational solidarity.\u201d",

      "The environment ministry said the Aude region has been experiencing a drought this month, with water use restrictions in place. Lack of rainfall in recent months \u201cplayed a major role in the spreading of the fire, since the vegetation is very dry,\u201d the statement said.",
      "This week\u2019s fire was the biggest since the creation of a national fire database in 2006, according to the national emergency service.",
      "Southern Europe has seen multiple large fires this summer. Scientists warn that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires. Last month, a wildfire that reached the southern port of Marseille, France\u2019s second-largest city, left around 300 people injured.",

      "Richard Bennett said in a report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Wednesday that after seizing power in 2021 the Taliban suspended the 2004 constitution and laws protecting the rights of women and girls. These include a landmark law that criminalized 22 forms of violence against women, including rape and child and forced marriage.",
      "The Taliban dismissed all judges under the previous U.S.-backed government, including approximately 270 women, replacing them with men who share their extreme Islamic views, lack legal training and hand down decisions based on edicts issued by the Taliban, he said.",
      "In addition, he noted that the Taliban have assumed full control over law enforcement and investigative agencies, systematically purging Afghans who worked for the previous government.",

He said he held meetings, focus-group discussions and one-on-one interviews with more that 110 Afghans inside and outside the country. He did so remotely because the Taliban have refused to grant him a visa to travel to Afghanistan.",
      "Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, their crackdown on women and girls has been widely reported and globally denounced.",

      "The Taliban defend their approach to justice by claiming they are implementing Islamic sharia law, but Islamic scholars and others have said their interpretation is unparalleled in other Muslim-majority countries and does not adhere to Islamic teachings. They say protecting the legal rights of women is a priority.",
      "Bennett said, however, that women have virtually no rights.",
      "\u201cToday, there are no women judges or prosecutors and no officially registered female lawyers, leaving women and girls with fewer safe channels to report abuse or seek redress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoupled with a lack of female officials in the police and other institutions, the result is widespread underreporting of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\u201d",
      "Bennett said access to justice for girls \u201cis further undermined by the dismantling of key legal safeguards and institutions protecting the rights of children,\u201d including juvenile courts and juvenile rehabilitation centers.",
      "The Taliban requirement that a woman must be accompanied by a male relative also creates barriers to filing complaints and attending court proceedings, he said, and disproportionately affects widows, women who are the heads of their households, the displaced and disabled.",
      "\u201cWomen who engage with the Taliban court system \u2014 whether as victims seeking redress, to resolve family issues, to obtain official documents or as alleged offenders \u2014 face a hostile environment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCourts often reject complaints made by women and are especially reluctant to accept cases relating to divorce, child custody and gender-based violence.\u201d",
      "Facing these obstacles, Bennett said, women increasingly turn to traditional and informal justice mechanisms, including formal jirgas and shuras \u2014 community councils of elders \u2014 and informal mediation by religious leaders, community elders or family. But these are all male-dominated and raise \u201cserious concerns about the rights of women and girls,\u201d he said.",
      "He said international forums offer the best hope for justice. He pointed to the International Criminal Court\u2019s request on Jan. 23 for arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders accused of crimes against humanity for persecution \u201con gender grounds.\u201d And he urged all countries to support efforts to bring Afghanistan before the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s highest tribunal, for violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."
