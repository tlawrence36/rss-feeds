      "Harvey Weinstein is returning to a New York court",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein returns to court Thursday, seeking to get his latest sex crime conviction thrown out because anger and apprehensions flared among jurors during deliberations last spring.",
      "It's the latest convoluted turn in the former Hollywood honcho's path through the criminal justice system. His landmark #MeToo-era case has spanned seven years, trials in two states, a reversal in one and a retrial that came to a messy end in New York last year. Weinstein was convicted of forcing oral sex on one woman, acquitted of forcibly performing oral sex on another, and the jury didn't decide on a rape charge involving a third woman \u2014 a charge prosecutors vowed to retry yet again.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denies all the charges. They were one outgrowth of a stack of sexual harassment and sex assault allegations against him that emerged publicly in 2017 and ensuing years, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Early on, Weinstein apologized for \u201cthe way I've behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d while also denying that he ever had non-consensual sex.",
      "At trial, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the women willingly accepted his advances in hopes of getting work in various capacities in show business, then falsely accused him to net settlement funds and attention.",
      "The split verdict last June came after multiple jurors took the unusual step of asking to brief the judge on behind-the-scenes tensions.",
      "In a series of exchanges partly in open court, one juror complained that others were \u201cshunning\u201d one of the panel members; the foreperson alluded to jurors \u201cpushing people\u201d verbally and talking about Weinstein's \u201cpast\u201d in a way the juror thought improper; yet a third juror opined that discussions were \u201cgoing well.\u201d The foreperson later came forward again to complain to the judge about being pressured to change his mind, then said he feared for his safety because a fellow panelist had said he would \u201csee me outside.\u201d The foreperson eventually refused to continue deliberating.",
      "In court, Judge Curtis Farber cited the secrecy of ongoing deliberations and reminded jurors not to disclose \u201cthe content or tenor\u201d of them. Since the trial, Weinstein's lawyers have talked with the first juror who openly complained and with another who didn't.",
      "In sworn statements, the two said they didn't believe Weinstein was guilty, but had given in because of other jurors' verbal aggression.",

      "One said that after a fellow juror insulted her intelligence and suggested the judge should remove her, she was so afraid that she called two relatives that night and \u201ctold them to come look for me if they didn't hear from me, since something was not right about this jury deliberation process.\u201d All jurors\u2019 identities were redacted in court filings.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers contend the tensions amounted to threats that poisoned the process, and that the judge didn't look into them enough before denying the defense's repeated requests for a mistrial. Weinstein's attorneys are asking him to discard the conviction or, at least, conduct a hearing about the jury strains.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the judge was presented with claims about \u201cscattered instances of contentious interactions\u201d and handled them appropriately. Jurors' later sworn statements are belied, prosecutors say, by other comments from one of the same jury members. He told the media right after the trial that there \u201cwas just high tension\u201d in the group.",
      "Prosecutors also said the foreperson\u2019s concerns about discussions of Weinstein\u2019s past were vague and the topic wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits. Testimony covered, for example, 2017 media reports about decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.",
      "The judge is expected to respond Thursday. He could set the conviction aside, order a hearing or let the verdict stand without any further action. Whatever he decides could be appealed.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they're prepared to retry Weinstein on the rape charge the jury couldn't decide last spring. Currently being held in New York, he also is appealing a rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d a based-on-a-true-tale hostage thriller that\u2019s as deeply 1970s as it is contemporary.",
      "In February 1977, Tony Kiritsis walked into the Meridian Mortgage Company in downtown Indianapolis and took one of its executives, Dick Hall, hostage. Kiritsis held a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall's head and draped a wire around his neck that connected to the gun. If he moved too much, he would die.",
      "The subsequent standoff moved to Kiritsis\u2019 apartment and eventually concluded in a live televised news conference. The whole ordeal received some renewed attention in a 2022 podcast dramatization starring Jon Hamm.",
      "But in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Kiritsis, these events are vividly brought to life by Van Sant. It\u2019s been seven years since Van Sant directed, following 2018\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot,\u201d and one of the prevailing takeaways of his new film is that that\u2019s too long of a break for a filmmaker of Van Sant's caliber.",
      "Working from a script by Austin Kolodney, the filmmaker of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d turns \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d into not a period-piece time capsule but a bracingly relevant drama of outrage and inequality. Tony feels aggrieved by his mortgage company over a land deal the bank, he claims, blocked. We\u2019re never given many specifics, but at the same time, there\u2019s little doubt in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d that Tony\u2019s cause is just. His means might be desperate and abhorrent, but the movie is very definitely on his side.",
      "That\u2019s owed significantly to Skarsg\u00e5rd, who gives one of his finest and least adorned performances. While best known for films like \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cNosferatu,\u201d here Skarsg\u00e5rd has little more than some green polyester and a very \u201970s mustache to alter his looks. The straightforward, jittery intensity of his performance propels \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "Yet Van Sant\u2019s film aspires to be a larger ensemble drama, which it only partially succeeds at. Tony\u2019s plight is far from a solitary one, as numerous threads suggest in Kolodney\u2019s fast-paced script. First and foremost is Colman Domingo as a local DJ named Fred Temple. (If ever there were an actor suited, with a smooth baritone, to play a \u201970s radio DJ, it\u2019s Domingo.) Tony, a fan, calls Fred to air his demands. But it\u2019s not just a media outlet for him. Fred touts himself as \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d",

      "Something similar could be said of Tony, who rapidly emerges as a kind of folk hero. As much as he tortures his hostage (a very good Dacre Montgomery), he\u2019s kind to the police officers surrounding him. And as he and Dick spend more time together, Dick emerges as a kind of victim, himself. It\u2019s his father\u2019s bank, and when Tony gets M.L. Hall (Al Pacino) on the phone, he sounds painfully insensitive, sooner ready to sacrifice his son than acknowledge any wrongdoing.",
      "Pacino\u2019s presence in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d is a nod to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d a movie that may be far better \u2014 but, then again, that\u2019s true of most films in comparison to Sidney Lumet\u2019s unsurpassed 1975 classic. Still, Van Sant\u2019s film bears some of the same rage and disillusionment with the meatgrinder of capitalism as \u201cDog Day.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a telling, if not entirely successful subplot of a local TV news reporter (Myha\u2019la) struggling against stereotypes. Even when she gets the goods on the unspooling news story, the way her producer says to \u201cchop it up\u201d and put it on air makes it clear: Whatever Tony is rebelling against, it\u2019s him, not his plight, that will be served up on a prime-time plate.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take recent similar cases of national fascination, such as Luigi Mangione, charged with killing a healthcare executive, to see contemporary echoes of Kiritsis' tale. The real story is more complicated and less metaphor-ready, of course, than the movie, which detracts some from the film's gritty sense of verisimilitude. Staying closer to the truth might have produced a more dynamic movie.",
      "But \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d still works. In the film, Tony\u2019s demands are $5 million and an apology. It's clear the latter means more to him than the money. The tragedy in \u201cDead Man's Wire\u201d is just how elusive \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can be.",
      "\u201cDead Man's Wire,\u201d a Row K Entertainment release, is rated R for language throughout. Running time: 105 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

      "Can they do it again",
      "When we first glimpse Noah Wyle\u2019s Michael Robinavitch \u2014 aka Dr. Robby, of course \u2014 in Season 2 of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d he\u2019s looking darned good, truth be told. The beloved ER doc is riding his motorcycle to work, wearing nice shades, hair rustling in the early-morning Pittsburgh breeze.",
      "Wait \u2014 hair rustling? It\u2019s only then we notice what\u2019s missing. Can it be that Robby \u2014 dedicated, wise, overworked, charming and brilliant \u2014 isn\u2019t wearing a helmet?",
      "It\u2019s such a jarring sight that, launching a Zoom interview with Wyle, it\u2019s one of the first things we must inquire about. Did we remember that right? Were we supposed to notice?",
      "Yes and yes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to notice that he doesn\u2019t wear it,\u201d Wyle confirms. \u201cBut then, he tells people that he does. Which means, you know he\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s lying about.\u201d",
      "More broadly, it\u2019s all part of the goal this new season, after an impactful, Emmy-winning debut that culminated with a mass shooting. There were worries that they wouldn\u2019t be able to up the ante. Well, the idea is not to up the ante, Wyle says, but to more deeply explore characters and their issues.",
      "\u201cOur job isn't to come up with another stunt that creates drama to be the catalyst for excitement on the show,\u201d Wyle says. \u201cOur job is to be faithful to the characters that we\u2019ve initiated. To plot them in space and time in a real three-dimensional way, and allow their lives and what they\u2019re going through to generate the drama and the tension.\u201d",
      "Hence the no-helmet scene \u2014 a last-minute decision the night before. They'd planned for Robby to wear a helmet. But Wyle says he suggested to executive producer John Wells that if he didn\u2019t, \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to trust and what not to trust from that moment forward, and the audience will be privy to a secret that the characters around him aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe dug it, so we went with that.\u201d",
      "The timing \u2013 July 4 \u2013 was hardly chosen haphazardly. Think holiday gatherings, fireworks, injuries we can imagine and worse ones we can\u2019t. But also, timing is important for the characters \u2014 it's been 10 months since last season's events.",
      "Dr. Frank Langdon has spent those months in rehab. The hard-driving senior resident with the much-noticed dimpled chin ran into serious trouble in the first season when he was caught stealing prescription meds to feed his addiction.",
      "Well, Frank\u2019s been given a reprieve, and he\u2019s on his first day back. Robby, for one, is not thrilled.",
      "But Patrick Ball, who plays Frank, is very relieved at his own reprieve. He'd been biting his nails as he awaited his character\u2019s fate.",
      "\u201cPretty much the entirety of my time on \u2018The Pitt\u2019 has been praying for a job and hoping I don\u2019t get fired,\u201d Ball quips. \u201cI was sweating pretty hard.\u201d He got the good news that he'd be back in a call from Wells, while walking on a rainy New York street.",
      "Katherine LaNasa, who plays all-knowing charge nurse Dana, had a similar sense of uncertainty. She was a breakout star of the first season, winning one of the show\u2019s five Emmys. But her character also seemed headed out the door, disillusioned by a brutal punch from an unruly patient.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, really, please don\u2019t get rid of me now!\u201d LaNasa says she thought. Happily, Dana too is back, taking charge as her title implies, with that sassy but maternal demeanor.",
      "\u201cI think of her as like a basketball coach,\u201d says LaNasa of Dana. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at what\u2019s going on, and what do people need to do their best? \u2026 I have children that are 24 years apart in age and so, I feel like I\u2019ve just been mothering my whole life.\u201d",

      "\u201cI just want to do the perfect joke but it\u2019s like people do not have a sense of humor about Julia Roberts,\u201d Glaser said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine \u2014 other people are not fine on her behalf. Like the most innocent joke about her that I made a couple times trying it out, they booed, they were like jeering.\u201d",

      "The House is pushing ahead with legislation to renew subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Overpowering Speaker Mike Johnson, a bipartisan coalition in the House voted Wednesday to push forward a measure that would revive an enhanced pandemic-era subsidy that lowered health insurance costs for roughly 22 million people, but that had expired last month.",
      "The tally of 221-205 was a key test before passage of the bill, which is expected Thursday. And it came about because four GOP centrist lawmakers joined with Democrats in signing a so-called discharge petition to force the vote. After last year's government shutdown failed to resolve the issue, they said doing nothing was not an option as many of their constituents faced soaring health insurance premiums beginning this month.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who crossed party lines to back the Democratic proposal, portrayed it as a vehicle senators could use to reach a compromise.",
      "\u201cNo matter the issue, if the House puts forward relatively strong, bipartisan support, it makes it easier for the senators to get there,\u201d Lawler said.",
      "In the end, nine Republicans joined Democrats to advance the measure.",
      "If ultimately successful in the House this week, the voting would show there is bipartisan support for a proposed three-year extension of the tax credits that are available for those who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The action of forcing a vote has been an affront to Johnson and GOP leaders, who essentially lost control of their House majority as the renegade lawmakers joined Democrats for the workaround.",
      "But the Senate is under no requirement to take up the bill.",
      "Instead, a small group of members from both parties is working on an alternative plan that could find support in both chambers and become law. One proposal would be to shorten the extension of the subsidy to two years and make changes to the program.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said any plan passing muster in the Senate will need to have income limits to ensure that it's focused on those who most need the help and that beneficiaries would have to at least pay a nominal amount for their coverage.",

      "It's unclear whether the negotiations will yield a bill that the Senate will take up. Democrats are making clear that the higher health insurance costs many Americans are facing will be a political centerpiece of their efforts to retake the majority in the House and Senate in the fall elections.",

Brian Fitzpatrick, Robert Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie, all from Pennsylvania, and Lawler signed the Democrats' petition, pushing it to the magic number of 218 needed to force a House vote. All four represent key swing districts whose races will help determine which party takes charge of the House next year.",
      "Johnson, R-La., had discussed allowing more politically vulnerable GOP lawmakers a chance to vote on bills that would temporarily extend the subsidies while also adding changes such as income caps for beneficiaries. But after days of discussions, the leadership sided with the more conservative wing of the party\u2019s conference, which has assailed the subsidies as propping up a failed program.",
      "Lawmakers turn to discharge petitions to show support for an action and potentially force a vote on the House floor, but they are rarely successful. This session of Congress has proven an exception.",
      "A vote requiring the Department of Justice to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, for instance, occurred after Reps.

      "The overhaul is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases, down from 18 a year ago.",
      "The changes comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising.",

      "\u2014 PCV or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "However, many European countries recommend some of the vaccines the U.S. removed from its list.",
      "The nation's large doctors' groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, say they will continue to recommend the vaccines that the Trump administration has now demoted. They said there was no new science that warranted the changes, including no signs that the former U.S. vaccine schedule harmed children.",
      "Dr. Sean O'Leary of the AAP said the changes could increase child illness and death from preventable disease. He voiced special concern that the U.S. would no longer recommend flu vaccine for children, just as the flu season is becoming severe and after last winter's particularly harsh season.",
      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own child vaccine recommendations. Also, states, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "It's not yet clear. Because of the countering recommendations from pediatricians, doctor visits may not change. However, medical specialists say when the U.S. government doesn't explicitly recommend a shot, it will raise questions among parents, leading to more difficult conversations at the doctor's office.",
      "If the changes mean fewer children are vaccinated, outbreaks that have historically been prevented by high vaccination rates could spread more widely, leading to more disease and more missed school and work.",
      "The Trump administration said coverage will continue for families that still want the shots. Health insurers generally find vaccination a good deal, as shots are cheaper than hospitalizations, and many had previously said they'd planned to cover what was recommended last year through 2026.",

      "The U.S. has taken the unprecedented step of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups say would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.",
      "The change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What's no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what's called \u201cshared decision-making.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won't result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.",
      "States, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "The change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "\u201cThis decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is \u201cfar more reasonable\u201d and \u201cfinally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.\u201d",
      "Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.",
      "Medical experts said Monday's changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.",
      "\u201cAbandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\u201d said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just copy and paste public health and that\u2019s what they seem to be doing here,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. \u201cLiterally children's health and children's lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "Most high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.",
      "France today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.",

      "The changes were made by political appointees, without any evidence that the current recommendations were harming children, O'Leary said.",
      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.",
      "O'Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is \u201cpretty tone deaf\u201d for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.",
      "Even a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.",
      "The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.",
      "The officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn\u2019t specify who was consulted.",
      "Scientists at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency\u2019s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.",
      "\u201cChanges of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.\u201d",
      "The move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.",
      "In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women \u2014 a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee \u2014 later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.",
      "Kennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",
      "Road traffic deaths in Africa are also rising quicker than in any other region, with fatalities jumping 17% between 2010 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest Africa road safety report released in mid-2024.",
      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",
      "To increase road safety, police in Zimbabwe have recently acquired body cameras and breathalyzers and are pushing for a review of the driver licensing system, including docking points for offenders and a revamp of driver training programs to highlight the dangers of reckless driving.",

      "Protests in Iran, driven by economic issues, have spread nationwide, challenging the country's theocracy",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Protests in Iran sparked by economic woes have now gone nationwide in the Islamic Republic, activists said Thursday, signaling both their staying power and intensity as they challenge the country's theocracy.",
      "Wednesday saw the most-intense day of demonstrations, reaching rural towns and major cities in every province though still localized enough for daily life to continue in Tehran, Iran's capital, and elsewhere. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations. But any intensification may seem them act.",
      "Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,\u201d wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran.",
      "\u201cThere may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country\u2019s potential transformational leaders.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah.",
      "Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.",
      "Demonstrations continued Thursday, with merchants closing their shops in Iran\u2019s Kurdistan province.",
      "It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s warned last week that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d America \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments drew a new rebuke from Iran's Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cRecalling the long history of criminal interventions by successive U.S. administrations in Iran\u2019s internal affairs, the Foreign Ministry considers claims of concern for the great Iranian nation to be hypocritical, aimed at deceiving public opinion and covering up the numerous crimes committed against Iranians,\u201d it said.",

      "But those comments haven't stopped the U.S. State Department on the social platform X from highlighting online footage purporting to show demonstrators putting up stickers naming roads after Trump or throwing away government-subsidized rice.",
      "\u201cWhen prices are set so high that neither consumers can afford to buy nor farmers can afford to sell, everyone loses,\u201d the State Department said in one message. \u201cIt makes no difference if this rice is thrown away.\u201d",
      "The demonstrations so far broadly appear to be leaderless, like other rounds of protests in Iran in recent years. However, Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah, has urged the public in Iran to shout from their windows and roofs on Thursday and Friday nights at 8 p.m. (1630 GMT).",
      "\u201cWherever you are, whether in the streets or even from your own homes, I call on you to begin chanting exactly at this time,\u201d Pahlavi said in an online video that's also been promoted by Iranian satellite news channels abroad. \u201cBased on your response, I will announce the next calls to action.\u201d",
      "Whether people take part will be a sign of possible support for Pahlavi, whose support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December.",
      "\u201cSince Dec. 28, 2025, the people of Iran have taken to the streets, just as they did in 2009, 2019,\u201d her son Ali Rahmani said. \u201cEach time, the same demands came up: an end to the Islamic Republic, an end to this patriarchal, dictatorial and religious regime, the end of the clerics, the end of the mullahs' regime.\u201d",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests.",
      "This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. Amini was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities. Her death became a rallying cry for women who continue to refuse to wear the hijab.",

      "BEIJING -- They\u2019re at it again.",
      "China and Japan \u2014 frenemies, trading partners and uneasy neighbors with a tortured, bloody history they still struggle to navigate \u2014 are freshly at each other\u2019s rhetorical throats as 2026 begins. And it\u2019s over the same sticking points that have kept them resentful and suspicious for many decades: Japan\u2019s occupation of parts of China in the 20th century, the use of military power in East Asia, economics and politics \u2014 and, of course, pride.",
      "From insinuations that Chinese citizens face dangers in Japan to outright accusations of resurgent Japanese imperialism, this first week of the year in China has been marked by the communist government scorning Tokyo on multiple fronts and noticeably embracing the visiting leader of another crucial strategic neighbor: South Korea.",
      "The latest chapter in Japan-China enmity surged In November when Japan's new leader waded into choppy bilateral waters. She said, in effect, that if China moved militarily against Taiwan, she wouldn't rule out involving Japan's constitutionally defense-only military. That didn't go over well in Beijing, which has teed off on Tokyo over the years for far less.",
      "\u201cPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s erroneous remarks concerning Taiwan infringe upon China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, blatantly interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, and send a military threat against China,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday, a week after military exercises around the island ended. \u201cWe urge Japan to face up to the root causes of the issue, reflect and correct its mistakes.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s hardly uncommon language. China frequently demands Japan ponder the path it has taken and correct its \u201cerroneous\u201d course. It's rhetoric, sure, but it goes far deeper. And sometimes it's hard to tell what's real umbrage and what's ginned up for domestic political consumption.",
      "Because when it comes to the China-Japan relationship, anger remains a powerful and enduring tool on both sides. And there's no indication that's going away anytime soon.",
      "From the time Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895 after a war with Qing Dynasty China, a deep suspicion and at times outright enmity has existed between the two countries.",
      "It worsened in the 1920s and 1930s after Japan\u2019s brutal occupation of parts of China resulted in torture and deaths that Chinese resent to this day. At the same time, Japanese leaders have sometimes thrown incendiary political footballs like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese who gave their lives in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 including some war criminals from the Sino-Japanese wars. China, like clockwork, responds with indignation.",
      "Japan lost World War II to the Allied powers and relinquished offensive military powers under a U.S.-drafted constitution, even as the current communist Chinese government was establishing the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. Since then, any hint of Japanese military assertiveness has drawn great umbrage here. Disputes over territory, such as an island chain called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spike occasionally.",
      "The enmity, pulled out when something is perceived as aggressive or anger is required for a domestic audience, lurks barely beneath the surface, ready to pop. Even today, cartoons circulate online in China depicting Japanese as demonic, aggressive and anti-China.",
      "This week has been an illuminating case study.",
      "On Tuesday, China slapped restrictions on \u201cdual-use exports\u201d to Japan \u2014 anything, it said, that Japan could adapt for military use. Though it didn't specify what the ban includes, anything from drones to rare earths could be considered dual-use. The lack of specificity allows China to adjust its approach as it goes \u2014 making it more or less strict depending on where the political winds are blowing.",
      "Japan demanded the move be rescinded. \u201cThese measures, which only target Japan, deviate significantly from international practice,\u201d its Foreign Ministry said, calling China's actions \u201cabsolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d This came days after it protested Chinese mobile drilling rigs in the East China Sea.",

The Commerce Ministry said it had launched an investigation into why the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024. \u201cThe dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,\u201d it said.",
      "Finally, on Thursday, China's Arms Control and Disarmament Association, a nongovernment agency (inasmuch as any agency in China is nongovernmental) released with some fanfare a report provocatively titled \u201cNuclear Ambitions of Japan's Right-Wing Forces: A Serious Threat to World Peace.\u201d It spent 29 pages outlining worries and accusations that Tokyo harbors dangerous nuclear ambitions.",

      "\u201cJapan has never been able to fully eliminate the scourge of militarism in the country,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Japan's right-wing forces are left free to develop powerful offensive weapons, or even possess nuclear weapons, it will again bring disaster to the world.\u201d",

Seoul has a bumpy history of its own with Japanese aggression and also sporadic \u2014 though generally less intense \u2014 friction with Beijing, a longtime supporter and ally of its rival North Korea.",

Also visible: Lee at two business events watching major companies pledge increased collaboration. The sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.",
      "The burst of official affection toward South Korea didn't stop with Lee. While he was here, Chinese media reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from the mainland over New Year\u2019s. That's on top of Beijing's recent efforts to discourage Chinese from traveling to Japan, citing \u201csignificant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens\u201d there.",
      "For now, Japan-China tension remains a matter of rhetoric and policy. But no one is predicting a quick resolution. With Japan's staunch ally, the United States, planning to furnish more arms to Taiwan in a single sale than ever before, there's too much at stake for both East Asian nations at this moment \u2014 and too much contentious history \u2014 for an easy and quick solution.",
      "\"This time ... de-escalation and a return to the status quo may not be as easily achieved,\" Sebastian Maslow, an East Asia specialist and associate professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo, wrote in The Conversation last month. \u201cWith diplomatic channels in short supply and domestic political agendas paramount, an off-ramp for the current dispute is not in sight.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a wide-ranging royal commission into antisemitism, weeks after two gunmen opened fire on a Jewish holiday event at Bondi Beach, killing 15 people.",
      "The commission will investigate the nature, prevalence and drivers of antisemitism generally as well as the circumstances of the Bondi mass shooting, Albanese told reporters in Canberra on Thursday. It will also make recommendations for law enforcement, strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of extremism.",
      "A royal commission, which is the most powerful form of government-commissioned inquiry that can be held in Australia, has the power to summon witnesses and request documents as evidence. It will be led by former High Court judge Virginia Bell, Albanese said.",
      "A report is due by Dec. 14, which will be a year to the day since the shooting during a Hanukkah celebration at the Sydney landmark.",
      "\u201cThis was an antisemitic terrorist attack, aimed at Jewish Australians, inspired by ISIS, the deadliest that has ever occurred on Australian soil,\" said Albanese, referring to the Islamic State group. The surviving suspect, Naveed Akram, 24, faces dozens of criminal charges including murder and terrorism.",

      "Saudi Arabia alleges the United Arab Emirates smuggled a wanted separatist leader out of Yemen",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia alleged Thursday that the United Arab Emirates smuggled a separatist leader in Yemen wanted for treason out of the country and flew him to Abu Dhabi.",
      "The UAE had no immediate reaction to the claim, which further escalates tensions between the neighboring nations on the Arabian Peninsula as their partnership in the yearslong war in Yemen breaks down.",
      "A Saudi military statement claimed Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of the Southern Transitional Council, fled Yemen by boat to Somalia. Then, UAE officials flew al-Zubaidi to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the Emirates, the statement said. The UAE has been the major supporter of the council, known as the STC, which sparked a confrontation between Saudi Arabia and the Emirates in recent days after STC fighters advanced in two governorates and appeared to be preparing to secede from Yemen.",
      "The Saudi statement from Maj. Gen. Turki al-Malki included him naming a major general in the UAE as being involved in al-Zubaidi's alleged escape, along with identifying his nom de guerre \u2014 something highly unusual in the typical clubby world of Gulf Arab relations. It also suggested an Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft used in the operation had been used in \u201cconflict zones\u201d like Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia \u2014 routes the Emirati military has been accused of funneling weapons through in the past.",
      "The UAE has denied running guns into those areas. The Emirati Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The STC did not immediately acknowledge the allegation either, saying Wednesday that al-Zubaidi had remained in Aden, where forces allied against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels had congregated for years since the rebels seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa.",
      "Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, said on X Thursday morning that he met with the STC delegation that landed in Riyadh a day earlier. They discussed al-Zubaidi's recent actions, which he said \u201charmed the southern cause and didn't serve it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also explored ways to work in the future to address what happened in a manner that serves the Southern cause, the Coalition\u2019s efforts to achieve security and stability in Yemen, and we addressed the arrangements for the Southern Cause Conference, which will be held in Riyadh soon,\u201d he added.",
      "Meanwhile, Mohamed al-Ghaithi, an STC member and head of the negotiation and reconciliation committee supporting the Presidential Leadership Council, called the meeting with al-Jaber \u201cfruitful\" and praised the kingdom's initiative to sponsor the conference aimed at finding a resolution in the south. Al-Ghaithi confirmed that the delegation \u201crejected everything that harms unity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have heard clear commitments from our brothers in Riyadh towards our people\u2019s cause and ensuring a secure and stable future,\u201d he added in a post on X. On Wednesday, the STC had said it lost contact with it's delegation after they landed in Riyadh, with a Council representative saying that members' cellphones were either switched off or ringing with no one answering.",
      "Southern Yemen had been run under the Presidential Leadership Council, a group including al-Zubaidi and others, since 2022. On Wednesday, the leadership council expelled al-Zubaidi and charged him with treason after he apparently declined to fly to Saudi Arabia for talks. It marked the latest pushback against the STC by Saudi Arabia, which also recently launched airstrikes against the group and an arms shipment the kingdom said came from the UAE.",
      "The war in Yemen, on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula and bordering the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians. It has created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters. The Houthis have also launched attacks against shipping over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, disrupting a vital route for global commerce.",

      "Authorities in the city of Catania have suspended or restricted excursions to see the volcano's lava flows, prompting guides to go on strike for the first time in decades and leaving disgruntled tourists with fewer options to see the spectacle up close.",
      "Dozens of the guides demonstrated Wednesday in front of Mount Etna\u2019s lava flow gate, calling the new restrictions excessive and saying the lava flows are slow-moving enough to be viewed safely as has been done in the past.",
      "\u201cThese measures effectively nullify the role of guides, stripping them of their skills, function, and professional responsibility,\u201d a statement by the guides\u2019 regional board said.",
      "The lava flows are especially spectacular after sunset, but under the new rules, excursions are allowed only until dusk and can go no closer than 200 meters (660 feet) to the lava flow. Also, a previously existing limit of 10 people per group is being vigorously enforced, including with drones.",
      "Mount Etna is Europe\u2019s most active volcano and the continent\u2019s largest. It attracts hikers and backpackers to its slopes, while less adventurous tourists can take it in from a distance, most stunningly from the Ionian Sea.",
      "At 3,350 meters (almost 10,990 feet) tall and 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) wide, the Sicilian giant frequently offers a front-row seat to nature\u2019s power. Last June, a massive eruption forced tourists to flee the volcano after a plume of high-temperature gases, ash and rock several kilometers high billowed into the air above them.",
      "The latest restrictions were adopted after Mount Etna started a round of eruptions on Christmas Eve.",
      "The most advanced lava front reached 1,360 meters (4,460 feet) above sea level, before stopping and entering a cooling phase after a journey of approximately 3.4 kilometers (about 2 miles), local authorities said. The lava flow poses no danger to nearby residential areas, volcanologists say.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged on Wednesday that \u201cwith the current situation in Venezuela, Mexico has become an important supplier\u201d of crude oil to Cuba, but asserted that \u201cno more oil is being sent than has been sent historically; there is no specific shipment.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe blackouts are going to intensify with all this,\u201d he said, adding that he believes the U.S. attacked because they want Venezuela's oil. \u201cThey own the world.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, street vendor Yeison G\u00e1lvez, 37, worries about the impact on transportation: \u201cFor as long as I can remember, we\u2019ve depended on Venezuela for fuel. We\u2019re going to be walking even more.\"",
      "It's unclear if any country would increase oil shipments to Cuba after the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The Mexican government has avoided commenting on its future plans. Exports to Cuba represent a very small percentage of total exports \u2014 3.3% \u2014 but their economic profitability is questionable, and Pemex\u2019s production continues to decline.",
      "From January to Sept. 30, 2025, Mexico shipped 19,200 barrels per day to Cuba: 17,200 barrels of crude oil and 2,000 barrels of refined products, according to the most recent report that state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",

      "After widespread protests in Cuba in 2021, Mexico sent one of its largest humanitarian aid shipments, which included 100,000 barrels of fuel. And in October 2024, it sent more than 400,000 barrels in just a few days following serious blackouts in Cuba, according to data provided at the time by Pi\u00f1\u00f3n.",
      "\u201cThe way this has been done also incentivizes opacity,\u201d Ocampo said, because since 2023, the shipments have been made via private Pemex subsidiary, Gasolinas Bienestar, whose financial situation \u201cis not transparent.\u201d",
      "In its report to the SEC, Pemex states that the shipments to Cuba were valued at approximately $400 million and were \u201csales\u201d made through contracts at market price.

      "The foreseeable lack of profitability in supplying oil to Cuba comes as 2025 is set to become the year in which Pemex exported the least amount of crude oil, \u201cwith less than 600,000 barrels per day, when just a couple of years ago we exported more than 1 million,\u201d Ocampo said.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union is renewing internal negotiations over a free trade agreement with five South American nations neighboring Venezuela a week after the United States' audacious raid there to detain President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Ministers of Agriculture from across the 27 European Union nations met in Brussels on Wednesday in part to discuss protecting farmers while also reaping the economic and geopolitical benefits of a free trade deal with the Mercosur nations of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. The EU's trade negotiator Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said after the meeting that while the deal would increase EU agrifood exports by up to 50%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a landmark one. This is the biggest free trade agreement we ever negotiated,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said. He said that EU trading partners \u201cvalue the EU for particular one thing in this turbulent world, one thing above all, this is credibility. So therefore, we must, safeguard this priceless currency by remaining a trusted and reliable trading partner.\u201d",
      "He said that EU negotiations over Mercosur will continue on Friday amid speculation that a deal could be signed in Paraguay on Jan. 12.",
      "Fierce opposition from France in December, fired up by enraged farmers, derailed the deal and forced European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to scrap a trip to Brazil where top EU officials had hoped to sign the EU-Mercosur deal after 26 years of negotiations.",
      "Italy is seen as the linchpin of the deal. If Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni joins the deal's supporters led by Germany, then it will pass over the objections of France and Poland. She posted on X on Tuesday that she welcomed von der Leyen's proposal to fast-track funds to farmers but Meloni did not promise crucial backing to the deal.",
      "The Mercosur trade deal covers a market of 780 million people and a quarter of the globe\u2019s gross domestic product, and would progressively remove duties on almost all goods traded between the two blocs. Such a massive free trade deal would provide a stark counterpoint in South America of economic diplomacy compared to the Trump administration's incursion into Venezuela and threats across the region.",

Prince had boasted of getting $30 million a day from the scams, according to the indictment.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department and the U.K. Foreign Office imposed sanctions, while authorities also seized Chen Zhi's assets, which included properties worth at least $100 million and $14 billion worth in cryptocurrency.",
      "Scam centers have proliferated across Southeast Asia, swindling money from victims by persuading them to join bogus investment schemes. According to estimates from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, scam victims worldwide lost between $18 billion and $37 billion in 2023.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. imposed sanctions against Chen, 38, and his companies' legitimate involvements or legally registered entities, which were primarily involved in real estate development and financial services.",
      "U.S. authorities also seized what they said was an estimated $14 billion in bitcoin linked to Chen or his operations, and charged him with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies. He was accused of sanctioning violence against workers, authorizing bribes to foreign officials and using his other businesses, such as online gambling and cryptocurrency mining, to launder illicit profits.",
      "Prosecutors in the U.S. charged that his organization scammed 250 Americans out of millions of dollars, with one losing $400,000 in cryptocurrency. In 2024, Americans lost at least $10 billion to Southeast Asia-based scams, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.",
      "British authorities froze Chen\u2019s British businesses and assets, including a 12 million-euro-mansion and a 100-million-euro office building in London.",
      "Then other authorities followed. Singapore launched an investigation on Oct. 30 after announcing the seizure of financial assets belonging to Chen worth more than $150 million Singaporean dollars ($114 million) and a yacht. In Taiwan, police seized 26 luxury cars including a Ferrari, Bugatti and a Porsche, while Hong Kong police seized financial assets. All three authorities launched investigations into Chen.",
      "But Chen was prepared to fight, issuing a statement via lawyers in November, that \u201cthe Prince Group categorically rejects the notion that it or its Chairman has engaged in any unlawful activity.\" The Cambodian government also issued a muted response, saying in a statement that it doesn\u2019t protect lawbreakers, a spokesperson said, but that Cambodia is not accusing Chen or the Prince group of wrongdoing.",

      "That tension was on split-screen display this week as Petro lashed out at Trump while his top officials rushed to assure the U.S. that Colombia remains the pillar of its counternarcotics strategy abroad.

      "Infuriated, Trump has deployed language that he often used to describe Maduro, calling Petro a \u201clunatic\u201d and an \u201cinternational drug leader.\u201d He has revoked Petro's U.S. visa; slapped sweeping sanctions on him, his relatives and his interior minister on drug-related grounds; vowed to end all U.S. aid to Colombia; and threatened punitive tariffs on Colombian exports.",
      "Thrilled by Maduro's ouster, Trump pushed the fight even further in recent days. He called Petro a \u201csick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States\u201d and warned of a possible U.S. military operation on Colombian soil.",
      "Petro can't help relishing the conflict \u2014 as long as it remains only verbal. Frustrated with congressional resistance to his contentious reforms, failing to fulfill his promise of \u201ctotal peace\u201d with armed groups and facing a series of electoral tests, Petro has found in Trump the perfect foil as he fights for his legacy.",

      "\u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,\u201d the leaders said Tuesday in a joint statement.

      "Chubu Electric Power Co. had applied for safety screening to resume operations at the No. 3 and 4 reactors at the Hamaoka nuclear power plant in 2014 and 2015. Two other reactors at the plant are being decommissioned, and a fifth is idle.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday opened a new phase of his pontificate by gathering the world\u2019s cardinals to Rome and indicating some reform-minded priorities by calling the modernizing teachings of the Second Vatican Council the \u201cguiding star\u201d of the church.",
      "Red-capped cardinals trickled into the Vatican\u2019s audience hall for the opening session of the two-day meeting, the first of Leo's papacy. Several cardinals said they didn't know what to expect, since Leo's written invitation had spoken only in vague terms about four main agenda items.",
      "\u201cWe'll see, we'll see, we haven't even started yet. Be patient!\u201d Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, said as he arrived.",
      "But during his morning general audience Wednesday, Leo gave the strongest signal yet about the direction of his still-young pontificate, calling for the full implementation of the reforms of Vatican II, the 1960s meetings that modernized and revolutionized the Catholic Church and remain a source of debate today.",
      "Leo said that for the foreseeable future, he would devote his weekly catechism lessons to a rereading of key Vatican II documents, noting that the generation of bishops and theologians who had attended the meetings and crafted the reforms are dead.",
      "\u201cTherefore, while we hear the call not to let its prophecy fade, and to continue to seek ways and means to implement its insights, it will be important to get to know it again closely, and to do so not through hearsay or interpretations that have been given, but by rereading its documents and reflecting on their content,\u201d he said.",
      "Citing all the popes from Vatican II forward who spoke about its importance, Leo said: \u201cIndeed, it is the magisterium that still constitutes the guiding star of the church\u2019s journey today.\u201d",
      "Among other things, Vatican II allowed for use of the vernacular rather than Latin for Mass. It called for greater participation of lay faithful in the life of the church and revolutionized Catholic relations with Jews and people of other faiths. At the time and in the decades since, though, its reforms crystalized the divisions between traditionalist, conservative Catholics and the more progressive wing of the church that are still alive today.",
      "Leo\u2019s first few months as pope were dominated by fulfilling the intense 2025 Holy Year obligations of meeting with pilgrimage groups, celebrating special Jubilee audiences and Masses and wrapping up the outstanding matters of Pope Francis\u2019 pontificate.",
      "He called the consistory of cardinals, as such meetings are known, to begin the day after he closed out the Jubilee, suggesting that he too saw its conclusion as the opportunity to unofficially launch his pontificate and look ahead to his own agenda.",
      "It was a significant gesture, since Francis had relied not on consistories or the College of Cardinals as a whole to help him govern, but rather a small, hand-picked group of nine cardinals who met every few months at the Vatican.",

      "On the agenda is a discussion of two of Francis\u2019 key reform documents: his original mission statement issued at the start of his pontificate, and the 2022 document that reformed the Vatican bureaucracy. Also being discussed is Francis' call for the church to be more \u201csynodal,\u201d or responsive to the needs of rank-and-file Catholics, and a discussion of the liturgy, according to Vatican News.",
      "The last agenda item is believed to refer to divisions within the church over the old Latin Mass, which was celebrated before the Vatican II reforms allowed Mass in different languages and with the active participation of the faithful.",
      "Francis had greatly restricted the celebration of the old Latin Mass, arguing its spread in recent years had created divisions in the church. But Francis\u2019 crackdown fueled a strong conservative and traditionalist backlash against him, especially in the United States, which the Chicago-born Leo seems keen to try to pacify.",
      "\u201cCritics of Francis have held out hope that Leo XIV will relax restrictions on the Latin Mass, but given his emphasis on church unity and Vatican II, Leo XIV might wait and see before making changes,\u201d Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at the Jesuit-run College of the Holy Cross, in Worcester, Massachusetts, said in an email.",

Zen, who turns 94 next week, was a fierce conservative critic of Francis, especially over the pope's outreach to China, and complained for years that the Argentine Jesuit wouldn\u2019t receive him in private audience.",

      "Seeking to halt the anger, Iran's government began Wednesday paying the equivalent of $7 a month to subsidize rising costs for dinner-table essentials like rice, meat and pastas. Shopkeepers warn prices for items as basic as cooking oil likely will triple under pressure from the collapse of Iran's rial currency and the end of a preferential subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate for importers and manufacturers \u2014 likely fueling further popular anger.",

He took over as commander-in-chief of the Iran's army, known by the Farsi word \"Artesh,\" after Israel killed a slew of the country's top military commanders in June's 12-day war. He is the first regular military officer in decades to hold a position long controlled by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.",
      "\u201cThe Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,\" Hatami said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.",

So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 38 people while more than 2,200 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "The growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran's civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So far, authorities haven't shut down the internet or fully flooded the streets with security forces like they did to put down the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations. But any intensification may seem them act.",
      "Meanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless, though a call for protests by Iran's exiled crown prince will test whether or not demonstrators are being swayed by messages from abroad.",

      "\u201cThere may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country\u2019s potential transformational leaders.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, at least 37 protests took place across the country, activists said. They included Shiraz, where online videos purported to show an anti-riot truck using a water cannon to target demonstrators. The state-run IRNA news agency, which has largely been silent about the demonstrations, reported on a mass demonstration in Bojnourd, as well as demonstrations in Kerman and Kermanshah.",
      "Iranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the protests. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed. The judiciary's Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.",

      "This round of protests has yet to reach the level of the months of protests surrounding the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022.

And it\u2019s over the same sticking points that have kept them resentful and suspicious for many decades: Japan\u2019s occupation of parts of China in the 20th century, the use of military power in East Asia, economics and politics \u2014 and, of course, pride.",
      "From insinuations that Chinese citizens face dangers in Japan to outright accusations of resurgent Japanese imperialism, this first week of the year in China has been marked by the communist government scorning Tokyo on multiple fronts and noticeably embracing the visiting leader of another crucial strategic neighbor: South Korea.",
      "The latest chapter in Japan-China enmity surged In November when Japan's new leader waded into choppy bilateral waters. She said, in effect, that if China moved militarily against Taiwan, she wouldn't rule out involving Japan's constitutionally defense-only military. That didn't go over well in Beijing, which has teed off on Tokyo over the years for far less.",
      "\u201cPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi\u2019s erroneous remarks concerning Taiwan infringe upon China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, blatantly interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, and send a military threat against China,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday, a week after military exercises around the island ended. \u201cWe urge Japan to face up to the root causes of the issue, reflect and correct its mistakes.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s hardly uncommon language. China frequently demands Japan ponder the path it has taken and correct its \u201cerroneous\u201d course. It's rhetoric, sure, but it goes far deeper. And sometimes it's hard to tell what's real umbrage and what's ginned up for domestic political consumption.",
      "Because when it comes to the China-Japan relationship, anger remains a powerful and enduring tool on both sides. And there's no indication that's going away anytime soon.",
      "From the time Japan colonized Taiwan in 1895 after a war with Qing Dynasty China, a deep suspicion and at times outright enmity has existed between the two countries.",
      "It worsened in the 1920s and 1930s after Japan\u2019s brutal occupation of parts of China resulted in torture and deaths that Chinese resent to this day. At the same time, Japanese leaders have sometimes thrown incendiary political footballs like visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese who gave their lives in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 including some war criminals from the Sino-Japanese wars. China, like clockwork, responds with indignation.",
      "Japan lost World War II to the Allied powers and relinquished offensive military powers under a U.S.-drafted constitution, even as the current communist Chinese government was establishing the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. Since then, any hint of Japanese military assertiveness has drawn great umbrage here. Disputes over territory, such as an island chain called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, spike occasionally.",
      "The enmity, pulled out when something is perceived as aggressive or anger is required for a domestic audience, lurks barely beneath the surface, ready to pop. Even today, cartoons circulate online in China depicting Japanese as demonic, aggressive and anti-China.",
      "This week has been an illuminating case study.",
      "On Tuesday, China slapped restrictions on \u201cdual-use exports\u201d to Japan \u2014 anything, it said, that Japan could adapt for military use. Though it didn't specify what the ban includes, anything from drones to rare earths could be considered dual-use. The lack of specificity allows China to adjust its approach as it goes \u2014 making it more or less strict depending on where the political winds are blowing.",
      "Japan demanded the move be rescinded. \u201cThese measures, which only target Japan, deviate significantly from international practice,\u201d its Foreign Ministry said, calling China's actions \u201cabsolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable.\u201d This came days after it protested Chinese mobile drilling rigs in the East China Sea.",

      "On Wednesday, the focus turned to a gas called dichlorosilane, used in computer chip manufacturing. The Commerce Ministry said it had launched an investigation into why the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024. \u201cThe dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,\u201d it said.",
      "Finally, on Thursday, China's Arms Control and Disarmament Association, a nongovernment agency (inasmuch as any agency in China is nongovernmental) released with some fanfare a report provocatively titled \u201cNuclear Ambitions of Japan's Right-Wing Forces: A Serious Threat to World Peace.\u201d It spent 29 pages outlining worries and accusations that Tokyo harbors dangerous nuclear ambitions.",
      "But it also went broader, invoking once again its stance that the nation's right-wing leaders \u2014 and, by extension, the whole country itself \u2014 have \u201cfailed to reflect on Japan's history of aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cJapan has never been able to fully eliminate the scourge of militarism in the country,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf Japan's right-wing forces are left free to develop powerful offensive weapons, or even possess nuclear weapons, it will again bring disaster to the world.\u201d",
      "Also part of the equation this week: China's visible pivot to another regional neighbor, South Korea, whose president spent four days in Beijing. Seoul has a bumpy history of its own with Japanese aggression and also sporadic \u2014 though generally less intense \u2014 friction with Beijing, a longtime supporter and ally of its rival North Korea.",

Also visible: Lee at two business events watching major companies pledge increased collaboration. The sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.",
      "The burst of official affection toward South Korea didn't stop with Lee. While he was here, Chinese media reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from the mainland over New Year\u2019s. That's on top of Beijing's recent efforts to discourage Chinese from traveling to Japan, citing \u201csignificant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens\u201d there.",
      "For now, Japan-China tension remains a matter of rhetoric and policy. But no one is predicting a quick resolution. With Japan's staunch ally, the United States, planning to furnish more arms to Taiwan in a single sale than ever before, there's too much at stake for both East Asian nations at this moment \u2014 and too much contentious history \u2014 for an easy and quick solution.",
      "\"This time ... de-escalation and a return to the status quo may not be as easily achieved,\" Sebastian Maslow, an East Asia specialist and associate professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo, wrote in The Conversation last month. \u201cWith diplomatic channels in short supply and domestic political agendas paramount, an off-ramp for the current dispute is not in sight.\u201d",

      "State lawmakers and governors will have decisions to make in 2026 about the budgets for their biggest social safety net programs",
      "States have major decisions to make in 2026 about the social safety net and taxes in the aftermath of a sweeping law President Donald Trump signed last year.",
      "The federal government is shifting more responsibilities to states over the next few years, and states must prepare for greater costs in the Medicaid health care and SNAP food aid programs. They also must decide whether to offset upcoming federal funding cuts with state tax dollars. And they must weigh whether to cut state taxes on tips, overtime wages and other items to remain in line with Trump's big bill.",

      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is used by 42 million Americans to help buy groceries, is going to become more expensive for states to run and harder for some people to qualify for assistance.",
      "Currently, the federal government picks up the full cost of benefits \u2014 around $94 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September 2024 \u2014 and splits the administrative costs with the states, which run the program. The federal share of administrative costs for 2024 was about $6 billion.",
      "Starting Oct. 1, states will have to pay three-fourths of the cost to run the program. And starting in late 2027, some states that make errors in more than 6% of payments \u2014 often for paying a household more than it's supposed to get after its income rises \u2014 will have to start paying some of the costs of benefits.",
      "California already has allocated $84 million to try to reduce SNAP errors, plus additional money to help counties implement other new requirements.",
      "The shift in administrative costs could come to around $50 million a year in Florida, said Sky Beard, the Florida director for No Kid Hungry. Paying for some SNAP benefits, if the state is forced to, could be in the neighborhood of $1 billion a year. She said that\u2019s a reason lawmakers have a lot of questions about the details of error rates.",
      "Other states are weighing whether to put more money into SNAP.",
      "New Jersey Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat, said the state has an obligation to help people access health care and food. But he said the magnitude of federal cuts \u2014 as much as a $36 billion reduction for New Jersey over the next decade for Medicaid alone, according to KFF, an organization that researches health policy \u2014 could make it hard to keep all the state\u2019s social programs unchanged.",
      "\u201cWhat there will be is a commitment to doing our level best to make sure that all of the people\u2019s needs get covered,\u201d Coughlin said.",
      "The federal law signed by Trump imposes work requirements for some adults on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. Most states must start those work mandates by January 2027, which means they must be accounted for in their next state budgets.",
      "But states can start sooner if they desire.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced that his state will launch Medicaid work requirements in May. The Republican said the state could handle the change without hiring more government employees and that the work mandate \u201ccan have a gigantic impact in helping lift people up.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors slammed Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers on Wednesday for making what the government said were \"meritless\" and \"misleading\u201d claims about Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s ties to a lobbying firm and her decision to seek the death penalty in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Deputy Manhattan U.S. Attorney Sean Buckley wrote in a court filing that Mangione\u2019s lawyers wrongly claimed in a submission last month that Bondi, a former partner at Ballard Partners, was continuing to receive income through a profit-sharing arrangement with the firm, whose clients include UnitedHealthcare\u2019s parent company UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Bondi does have a 401(k) account through Ballard \u201creflecting past, fully earned compensation,\u201d but the firm agreed to stop making contributions when she left, Buckley wrote.",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s narrative collapses under the weight of his own assumptions, because a financial conflict theory requires a demonstrable financial benefit tethered to the litigation,\u201d Buckley wrote. \u201cWhere no present or future financial gain exists, there is no conflict.\u201d",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers argue that Bondi\u2019s past lobbying work and her subsequent role leading the charge to turn his federal prosecution into a capital case, have created a \u201cprofound conflict of interest\u201d that violated his due process rights. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Friday.",
      "Buckley said Mangione\u2019s lawyers also misconstrued Bondi\u2019s pledge in a January 2025 letter that, as attorney general, she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year. In the letter, he said, Bondi made clear that she would not participate in \u201cany matter in which Ballard Partners, or a client of Ballard Partners was a party.\"",
      "Bondi had no \u201cethical, statutory, or constitutional obligation to recuse herself\u201d from Mangione\u2019s criminal case because Ballard and the UnitedHealth Group companies are not parties to it, Buckley wrote. \u201cAny collateral reputational or emotional interest those companies may have in the outcome does not transform them into parties or entities\u201d requiring her to step aside.",

      "Bondi announced last April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",

      "Mangione\u2019s federal case is back in the forefront after a marathon pretrial hearing last month in his state case. He wants prosecutors barred from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive. A ruling isn\u2019t expected until May.",
      "Mangione\u2019s defense team, led by husband-and-wife Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, are now trying to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, pare down the case and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.",
      "In a September filing, Mangione\u2019s lawyers argued that Bondi\u2019s announcement that she was ordering prosecutors to seek the death penalty \u2014 which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance \u2014 showed the decision was \u201cbased on politics, not merit.\u201d They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.",
      "Bondi\u2019s statements and other official actions \u2014 including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration\u2019s flouting of established death penalty procedures \u2014 \u201chave violated Mr. Mangione\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,\u201d his lawyers said.",

    "story": [
      "Georgia is the latest state to consider eliminating its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to phase it out by 2032",
      "ATLANTA -- Eliminating state income taxes sounds great to many voters, but Republicans backing the push in multiple states still face questions about whether such big tax cuts can be made without raising other taxes or sharply cutting state funding for education, health care and other services.",
      "Georgia on Wednesday became the latest state to launch a bid to abolish its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to zero it out by 2032. This year, Georgia's personal income tax is projected to collect about $16.5 billion, or 44% of the state's general revenue.",
      "The push is driven by politics. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, the Republican who leads the state Senate, has made eliminating income taxes a centerpiece of his 2026 campaign for governor. State Sen. Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican who led a committee to abolish the tax, is among candidates to succeed Jones as lieutenant governor.",
      "\u201cThis is the first vote that we are going to get to take to address affordability,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal will pass. Georgia House Republicans may want to continue nibbling away at the tax in smaller bites, preferring a \u201cmeasured\u201d approach. Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington said Wednesday that his big 2026 goal is to eliminate property taxes for homeowners, but said he's willing to consider the Senate plan.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, serving his last year, has been cool to total elimination of the income tax. He declined to comment Wednesday on the Senate plan, but spokesperson Carter Chapman said Kemp wants \"to continue lowering taxes and putting more money in Georgians\u2019 pockets as he has throughout his term.\u201d",
      "The state's Democratic minority opposes the move, saying it would mostly benefit high earners and the state needs money to provide services.",
      "Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri have all set goals to abolish the personal income tax, joining eight other states that don't tax personal income. Eight other states besides Georgia are cutting personal income tax rates this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., group generally skeptical of higher taxes.",
      "\u201cWe've seen a lot of states cut their income tax rates in the last four or five years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and coming out of it,\u201d said Aravind Boddupalli, senior researcher at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C.",
      "Supporters say cuts help a state compete for new residents and businesses, pointing to growth in Texas and Florida, two states without personal income taxes.",
      "\u201cYour income tax is a tax on productivity,\u201d said Manish Bhatt, who studies state taxes for the Tax Foundation. \u201cIf you are taxing productivity, you are potentially losing out on economic gains.\u201d",
      "Georgia has already been cutting income taxes, taking what was once a top income tax rate of 6% and lowering it to a 5.19% flat rate. Republicans broadly support a further cut for individual and corporate taxpayers to 4.99% this year, worth an estimated $800 million in foregone tax revenue.",
      "The Senate plan would then freeze the corporate rate and focus on individual tax cuts. It proposes in 2027 to exempt the first $50,000 of income for a single person or $100,000 for a married couple, up from $12,000 and $24,000 now.",
      "Faced with Democratic criticism about affordability, the big increase in exempt income is central to Republicans' own arguments about how they can make money stretch farther. About 70% of Georgians reported less than $100,000 of taxable income in 2024, according to state figures.",

      "\u201cIt is a plan that gives benefits first to hardworking families,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "The initial rate cut, plus the exemption proposal, would lower Georgia revenue by $3.8 billion in its 2027 budget year. Tillery says the state could pay by using surplus tax revenue and shifting back to paying for capital expenditures through borrowing instead of cash. But those moves probably wouldn't cover the foregone revenue even in the first year, much less $13 billion more in cuts to get to zero.",
      "Tillery said revenue should be bolstered by trimming business income and sales tax breaks, saying legislators should reduce \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d But lawmakers and Kemp have balked at curtailing those measures in recent years.",
      "Tax cuts haven't always been a political bonanza. In Kansas, after Republicans under Gov. Sam Brownback cut income taxes steeply more than a decade ago, voters revolted at budget cuts and lawmakers imposed multiple tax increases to cover persistent budget shortfalls, including restoring some income tax cuts. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won her first term in 2018 by framing the race as a referendum on Brownback\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cState income taxes are only bad if you fundamentally don't believe that the services, the public investments that state governments provide, are worth anything,\u201d said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy .",
      "In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and GOP legislative leaders have made phasing out the state\u2019s income tax a top priority for the session starting Wednesday. They're looking to expand sales taxes to services which currently are untaxed to help offset lost revenue.",
      "\u201cWe want to do this in a smart, efficient way that\u2019s not going to have the state go off some sort of fiscal cliff,\u201d Missouri House Majority Leader Alex Riley told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "But expanding sales taxes could fall more heavily on poorer taxpayers. The liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute estimated that if Georgia doesn't expand its sales tax, the combined state and local sales tax rate would have to rise sharply from the current 7.42% to recover revenue losses.",
      "All that leads to questions about income-tax elimination plans, even from Republicans. Burns, the Georgia House speaker, said he's \u201copen\u201d to any plan that benefits Georgians.",
      "\u201cBut we've got to have the details, and it has to work,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe need to make sure we can continue to do vital services \u2014 health care, public safety, education, all the things we talked about.\u201d",

      "California will lose $160 million for delaying the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants, federal transportation officials announced Wednesday.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn\u2019t enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "The state notified these drivers in the fall that they would lose their licenses after a federal audit found problems that included licenses for truckers and bus drivers that remained valid long after an immigrant\u2019s visa expired. Some licenses were also given to citizens of Mexico and Canada who don't qualify. More than one-quarter of the small sample of California licenses that investigators reviewed were unlawful.",
      "But then last week California said it would delay those revocations until March after immigrant groups sued the state because of concerns that some groups were being unfairly targeted. Duffy said the state was supposed to revoke those licenses by Monday.",
      "Duffy is pressuring California and other states to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren\u2019t granted the licenses.",
      "\u201cOur demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again,\u201d Duffy said in a statement. \u201c(Gov.) Gavin Newsom has failed to do so \u2014 putting the needs of illegal immigrants over the safety of the American people.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe strongly disagree with the federal government\u2019s decision to withhold vital transportation funding from California \u2014 their action jeopardizes public safety because these funds are critical for maintaining and improving the roadways we all rely on every day,\u201d Spiegel said.",

      "The federal government began cracking down during the summer. The issue became prominent after a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New York, Texas, South Dakota, Colorado, and Washington after audits found significant problems under the existing rules, including commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver\u2019s work permit expired. He had dropped the threat to withhold nearly $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses.",

They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted.",

      "Trump \u2014 who has been under pressure to address voters' concerns about affordability ahead of November midterm elections \u2014 is tapping into long-standing fears that corporate ownership of homes has pushed out traditional buyers, forcing more people to rent. But his plan does little to address the overarching challenge for the housing market: a national shortage of home construction and prices that have climbed faster than incomes.",
      "\u201cPeople live in homes, not corporations,\u201d Trump said in a social media post as he called on Congress to codify his ban.",
      "Last month, Trump pledged in a prime-time address that he would roll out \u201csome of the most aggressive housing reform plans in American history\u201d this year. The president said he would discuss housing and affordability in more detail in two weeks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an event known for attracting CEOs, wealthy financiers and academics with a global focus who often run contrary to Trump's populist rhetoric.",

      "It\u2019s a role that could further complicate already strained relations with the Trump administration, even though the Mexican government insists that exports to the island have not increased.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged on Wednesday that \u201cwith the current situation in Venezuela, Mexico has become an important supplier\u201d of crude oil to Cuba, but asserted that \u201cno more oil is being sent than has been sent historically; there is no specific shipment.\u201d",
      "She added that those shipments are made via \u201ccontracts\u201d or as \u201chumanitarian aid,\u201d but offered no concrete figures on the number of barrels exported.",
      "Following the 1959 revolution that toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista, the U.S. imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in response to the nationalization of American-owned property. Under the embargo \u2014 long denounced by many countries, including Mexico \u2014 Cubans have suffered economic and energy crises, driving hundreds of thousands of Cubans to migrate, especially to the United States.",

      "Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez, a 65-year-old former construction worker and resident of Old Havana whose power goes out daily, said the upheaval in Venezuela will impact Cuba.",
      "\u201cThe blackouts are going to intensify with all this,\u201d he said, adding that he believes the U.S. attacked because they want Venezuela's oil. \u201cThey own the world.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, street vendor Yeison G\u00e1lvez, 37, worries about the impact on transportation: \u201cFor as long as I can remember, we\u2019ve depended on Venezuela for fuel. We\u2019re going to be walking even more.\"",
      "It's unclear if any country would increase oil shipments to Cuba after the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The Mexican government has avoided commenting on its future plans. Exports to Cuba represent a very small percentage of total exports \u2014 3.3% \u2014 but their economic profitability is questionable, and Pemex\u2019s production continues to decline.",
      "From January to Sept. 30, 2025, Mexico shipped 19,200 barrels per day to Cuba: 17,200 barrels of crude oil and 2,000 barrels of refined products, according to the most recent report that state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",

      "Mexico has historically sent oil to Cuba, especially during periods of power blackouts and social unrest.",
      "After widespread protests in Cuba in 2021, Mexico sent one of its largest humanitarian aid shipments, which included 100,000 barrels of fuel. And in October 2024, it sent more than 400,000 barrels in just a few days following serious blackouts in Cuba, according to data provided at the time by Pi\u00f1\u00f3n.",
      "\u201cThe way this has been done also incentivizes opacity,\u201d Ocampo said, because since 2023, the shipments have been made via private Pemex subsidiary, Gasolinas Bienestar, whose financial situation \u201cis not transparent.\u201d",
      "In its report to the SEC, Pemex states that the shipments to Cuba were valued at approximately $400 million and were \u201csales\u201d made through contracts at market price.

      "The foreseeable lack of profitability in supplying oil to Cuba comes as 2025 is set to become the year in which Pemex exported the least amount of crude oil, \u201cwith less than 600,000 barrels per day, when just a couple of years ago we exported more than 1 million,\u201d Ocampo said.",

      "BANGKOK -- Cambodia\u2019s government said Wednesday it had arrested and extradited to China a tycoon who has been accused of running a huge online scam operation.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry said Prince Holding Group chairman Chen Zhi and two other Chinese citizens were arrested and extradited Tuesday at the request of Chinese authorities. Chen formerly had dual nationality but his Cambodian citizenship was revoked in December, it said.",
      "U.S. prosecutors charged Chen in October with conspiracy charges alleging he masterminded a multinational cyberfraud network, used his other businesses to launder its profits and sanctioned violence against workers. Prince had boasted of getting $30 million a day from the scams, according to the indictment.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department and the U.K. Foreign Office imposed sanctions, while authorities also seized Chen Zhi's assets, which included properties worth at least $100 million and $14 billion worth in cryptocurrency.",
      "Scam centers have proliferated across Southeast Asia, swindling money from victims by persuading them to join bogus investment schemes. According to estimates from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, scam victims worldwide lost between $18 billion and $37 billion in 2023.",
      "The U.S. and U.K. imposed sanctions against Chen, 38, and his companies' legitimate involvements or legally registered entities, which were primarily involved in real estate development and financial services.",
      "U.S. authorities also seized what they said was an estimated $14 billion in bitcoin linked to Chen or his operations, and charged him with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies. He was accused of sanctioning violence against workers, authorizing bribes to foreign officials and using his other businesses, such as online gambling and cryptocurrency mining, to launder illicit profits.",
      "Prosecutors in the U.S. charged that his organization scammed 250 Americans out of millions of dollars, with one losing $400,000 in cryptocurrency. In 2024, Americans lost at least $10 billion to Southeast Asia-based scams, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.",
      "British authorities froze Chen\u2019s British businesses and assets, including a 12 million-euro-mansion and a 100-million-euro office building in London.",
      "Then other authorities followed. Singapore launched an investigation on Oct. 30 after announcing the seizure of financial assets belonging to Chen worth more than $150 million Singaporean dollars ($114 million) and a yacht. In Taiwan, police seized 26 luxury cars including a Ferrari, Bugatti and a Porsche, while Hong Kong police seized financial assets. All three authorities launched investigations into Chen.",
      "But Chen was prepared to fight, issuing a statement via lawyers in November, that \u201cthe Prince Group categorically rejects the notion that it or its Chairman has engaged in any unlawful activity.\" The Cambodian government also issued a muted response, saying in a statement that it doesn\u2019t protect lawbreakers, a spokesperson said, but that Cambodia is not accusing Chen or the Prince group of wrongdoing.",
      "Jacob Daniel Sims, a transnational crime expert and visiting fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Asia Center, said the Cambodian government had faced so much sustained international pressure that inaction was no longer an option.",

      "There was no immediate comment on the extraditions from the federal prosecutors\u2019 office in Brooklyn where Chen had been indicted. Chen and the Prince Holding Group had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Chinese authorities had no immediate comment on the extradition of Chen and the two other individuals named by Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry as Xu Ji Liang and Shao Ji Hui.",
      "Cybercrime has flourished in Southeast Asia where law enforcement is weak, particularly in Cambodia and Myanmar, with casinos often serving as hubs for criminal activity. Trafficked foreign nationals were employed to run \u201cromance\u201d and cryptocurrency scams, often recruited with false job offers and then forced to work in conditions of near-slavery.",
      "Chen\u2019s U.S. indictment alleged that Prince Holding Group built at least 10 compounds in Cambodia, although it only named three of them, Golden Fortune, Jinbei and Mango Park.",
      "The operations became an embarrassment to the Chinese government, especially when they targeted Chinese citizens. Beijing in mid-2023 pressured Myanmar to crack down on the crimes, and some kingpins were extradited to be tried in China. Several received death sentences.",
      "Since then, Beijing has continued to exert pressure in the region, working with Thailand and Myanmar to conduct a massive release of near 10,000 people from scam compounds located along the Thai and Myanmar border. Cambodia had also conducted a campaign in the summer to arrest a few thousand people from various scam centers.",
      "A 2023 report by the U.N. human rights office estimated that at least 120,000 people across Myanmar and 100,000 people in Cambodia may have been held in situations where they were forced to work on online scams. Experts say that such operations are continuing.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. employers posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren\u2019t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up.",
      "Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, the Labor Department said Wednesday, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped, however, as companies appear to be holding onto workers even as they are reluctant to add staff.",
      "The report suggests that the \u201clow-hire, low-fire\u201d job market remains in effect, with workers enjoying some job security but those out of work struggling to find new jobs. The moribund labor market stands in contrast with data showing solid economic growth, which topped 4% at an annual rate in last year's July-September quarter, the latest data available. Economists forecast growth slowed but remained solid in the final three months of 2025.",
      "A key question for this year is whether hiring will pickup to match healthy growth, or whether sluggish job gains will eventually drag down the economy. There is a third possibility: Automation and artificial intelligence could enable steady economic growth without creating many jobs.",
      "Further insights into that question will emerge Friday when the monthly jobs report for December will be released.",
      "The number of postings in November was the fewest since September 2024. But outside that month, it was the lowest in nearly five years.",
      "Open jobs in November fell sharply in shipping and warehousing, restaurants and hotels, and in state and local government. They rose in retail and construction.",
      "The number of Americans who quit their jobs ticked higher in November, which is seen as a good sign, because workers typically quit when they are more confident they can find a better job, or already have one. Yet quits remained historically low, at 3.16 million, up from just under 3 million in October.",

      "NEW YORK -- Warner Bros. again rejected a takeover bid from Paramount and told shareholders Wednesday to stick with a rival offer from Netflix.",
      "Warner\u2019s leadership has repeatedly rebuffed Skydance-owned Paramount\u2019s overtures \u2014 and urged shareholders just weeks ago to back its the sale of its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. Paramount, meanwhile, has made efforts to sweeten its $77.9 billion hostile offer for the entire company.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday that its board determined Paramount\u2019s offer is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. It again recommended shareholders support the Netflix deal.",
      "\u201cParamount\u2019s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,\" Warner Bros. Discovery Chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement. In contrast, he added, the company's agreement with Netflix \u201cwill offer superior value at greater levels of certainty.\u201d",
      "Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's hostile bid is still on the table. Warner shareholders currently have until Jan. 21 to \u201ctender\u201d their shares.",
      "Late last month, Paramount announced an \u201cirrevocable personal guarantee\u201d from Oracle founder Larry Ellison \u2014 who is the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison \u2014 to back $40.4 billion in equity financing for the company\u2019s offer. Paramount also increased its promised payout to shareholders to $5.8 billion if the deal is blocked by regulators, matching Netflix's breakup fee.",
      "In its Wednesday letter to shareholders, Warner expressed concerns about a potential deal with Paramount. Warner said it essentially considers the offer a leveraged buyout, which includes a lot of debt, and also pointed to operating restrictions that it said were imposed by Paramount's offer and could \u201champer WBD\u2019s ability to perform\u201d throughout a transaction.",

      "The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix\u2019s proposed acquisition includes only Warner\u2019s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount wants the entire company \u2014 which, beyond studio and streaming, includes networks like CNN and Discovery.",
      "If Netflix is successful, Warner\u2019s news and cable operations would be spun off into their own company, under a previously-announced separation.",
      "A merger with either company could take over a year to close \u2014 and will attract tremendous antitrust scrutiny along the way. Due to its size and potential impact, it will almost certainly trigger a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which could sue to block the transaction or request changes. Other countries and regulators overseas may also challenge the merger. And politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.",
      "Trade groups across the entertainment industry have continued to sound the alarm about both deals.",
      "In a statement addressed to a Congressional antitrust subcommittee on Wednesday, Cinema United \u2014 which represents more than 60,000 movie screens worldwide \u2014 reiterated it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that Netflix's acquisition could harm both moviegoers and people who work in theaters, pointing to the streaming giant's past reliance on its online platform. The group said its concerns were \u201cno less serious\u201d for Paramount's bid \u2014 warning of consequences of further consolidation overall, which it said could result in job losses and less diversity in filmmaking.",

      "For travelers, CEO John Pfeifer says the goal is fewer delays without compromising safety. The technology is also designed to keep those tarmac tasks moving even during severe weather, like winter storms or extreme heat, when conditions are daunting for human crews, Pfeifer said. Testing with major airlines is already underway, and the robots would likely debut at large hub airports like Atlanta or Dallas, with a goal of rolling them out over the next few years.",

      "A year after devastating fires in the L",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On the first anniversary of the most destructive wildfires in the L.A. area, the scant home construction projects stand out among the still mostly flattened landscapes.",
      "Fewer than a dozen homes have been rebuilt in Los Angeles County since Jan. 7, 2025, when the Palisades and Eaton fires erupted, killing 31 people and destroying about 13,000 homes and other residential properties.",
      "For those who had insurance, it\u2019s often not enough to cover the costs of construction. Relief organizations are stepping in to help, but progress is slow.",
      "Among the exceptions is Ted Koerner, whose Altadena home was reduced to ash and two chimneys. With his insurance payout tied up, the 67-year-old liquidated about 80% of his retirement holdings, secured contractors quickly, and moved decisively through the rebuilding process.",
      "Shortly before Thanksgiving, Koerner was among the first to finish a rebuild in the aftermath of the fires, which were fueled by drought and hurricane-force winds.",
      "But most do not have options like Koerner.",
      "The streets of the coastal community of Pacific Palisades and Altadena, a community in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, remain lined with dirt lots. In the seaside city of Malibu, foundations and concrete piles rising out of the sand are all that\u2019s left of beachfront homes that once butted against crashing ocean waves.",
      "Neighborhoods are pitch black at night, with few streetlamps replaced. Even many homes that survived are not inhabited as families struggle to clear them of the fire\u2019s toxic contaminants.",
      "Koerner was driven in part by fear that his beloved golden retriever, Daisy Mae, now 13 years old, might not live long enough to move into a new home, given the many months it can take to build even under the best circumstances.",
      "He also did not have to wait for his insurance payout to start construction.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we were going to get it done before all of a sudden my dog starts having labored breathing or something else happens,\u201d Koerner said.",
      "Once construction began, his home was completed in just over four months.",
      "Daisy Mae is back lying in her favorite spot in the yard under a 175-year-old Heritage Oak. Koerner said he enjoys his morning coffee while watching her and it brings tears to his eyes.",
      "\u201cWe made it,\u201d he said.",
      "About 900 homes are under construction, potentially on pace to be completed later this year.",
      "Still, many homeowners are stuck as they figure out whether they can pay for the rebuilding process.",
      "Scores of residents have left their communities for good. More than 600 properties where a single-family home was destroyed in the wildfires have been sold, according to real estate data tracker Cotality.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge gaps between the money insurance is paying out, to the extent we have insurance, and what it will actually cost to rebuild and/or remediate our homes,\u201d said Joy Chen, executive director of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a group of 10,000 fire survivors mostly from Altadena.",
      "By December, less than 20% of people who experienced total home loss had closed out their insurance claims, according to a survey by the nonprofit Department of Angels.",

      "In November, Los Angeles County opened a civil investigation into State Farm\u2019s practices and potential violations of the state\u2019s Unfair Competition law. Chen said the group has seen a flurry of substantial payouts since then.",

      "Rogers \u2014 now executive director of the Pacific Palisades Long Term Recovery Group \u2014 estimates there are hundreds like her in Pacific Palisades who are \u201cstuck dealing with FEMA and SBA and figuring out if we could piecemeal something together to build our homes.\u201d",

      "That so few homes have been rebuilt a year after the wildfires echoes the recovery pattern of a December 2021 blaze that erupted south of Boulder, Colorado, destroying more than 1,000 homes.",
      "\u201cAt the one-year mark, many lots had been cleared of debris and many residents had applied for building permits, said Andrew Rumbach, co-lead of the Climate and Communities Program at Urban Institute. \u201cAround the 18-month mark is when you start to see really significant progress in terms of going from handfuls to hundreds\u201d of homes rebuilt.",
      "Time will bring the scope of problems into focus.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to start to see some real inequality start to emerge where certain neighborhoods, certain types of people, certain types of properties are just lagging way far behind, and that becomes the really important question in the second year of a recovery: Who\u2019s doing well and who is really struggling and why?\u201d Rumbach said.",
      "That\u2019s a key concern in Altadena, which for decades drew aspiring Black homeowners who otherwise faced redlining and other forms of racial discrimination when they sought to buy a home in other L.A.-area communities. In 2024, 81% of Black households in Altadena owned their homes, nearly twice the national Black homeownership rate.",
      "But recent research by UCLA\u2019s Latino Policy & Politics Institute found that, as of August, 7 in 10 Altadena homeowners whose property was severely damaged in last year\u2019s wildfire had not begun taking steps to rebuild or sell their home. Among these, Black homeowners were 73% more likely than others to have taken no action.",
      "Al and Charlotte Bailey have been living in an RV parked on the empty lot where their home once stood.",
      "The Baileys are paying for their rebuild with funds from their insurance payout and a loan. They\u2019re also hoping to receive money from Southern California Edison. Several lawsuits claim its equipmentsparked the wildfire in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe had been here for 41 years and raised our family here, and in one night it was all gone,\u201d said Al Bailey, 77. \u201cWe decided that, whatever it\u2019s going to cost, this is our community.\"",

      "MIAMI -- In 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez spotted an opening.",
      "Then Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodr\u00edguez directed Citgo \u2014 a subsidiary of the state oil company \u2014 to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment. Around the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon.",
      "The charm offensive flopped. Within weeks of taking office, Trump, urged by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, made restoring Venezuela's democracy his driving focus in response to Maduro's crackdown on opponents. But the outreach did bear fruit for Rodr\u00edguez, making her a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles and paving the way for her own rise.",
      "\u201cShe's an ideologue, but a practical one,\u201d said Lee McClenny, a retired foreign service officer who was the top U.S. diplomat in Caracas during the period of Rodr\u00edguez's outreach. \"She knew that Venezuela needed to find a way to resuscitate a moribund oil economy and seemed willing to work with the Trump administration to do that.\"",
      "Nearly a decade later, as Venezuela\u2019s interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message \u2014 that Venezuela is open for business \u2014 seems to have persuaded Trump. In the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \u201cgracious\u201d American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \u201ctotal access\u201d to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.",
      "This account of Rodr\u00edguez's political rise is drawn from interviews with 10 former U.S. and Venezuelan officials as well as businessmen from both countries who've had extensive dealings with Rodr\u00edguez and in some cases have known her since childhood. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from someone who they almost universally described as bookishly smart, sometimes charming but above all a cutthroat operator who doesn't tolerate dissent. Rodr\u00edguez didn't respond to AP requests for an interview.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez entered the leftist movement started by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez late \u2014 and on the coattails of her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, who as head of the National Assembly swore her in as interim president Monday.",
      "Tragedy during their childhood fed a hardened leftist outlook that would stick with the siblings throughout their lives. In 1976 \u2014 when, amid the Cold War, U.S. oil companies, American political spin doctors and Pentagon advisers exerted great influence in Venezuela \u2014 a little-known urban guerrilla group kidnapped a Midwestern businessman. Rodriguez's father, a socialist leader, was picked up for questioning and died in custody.",
      "McClenny remembers Rodr\u00edguez bringing up the murder in their meetings and bitterly blaming the U.S. for being left fatherless at the age of 7. The crime would radicalize another leftist of the era: Maduro.",
      "Years later, while Jorge Rodr\u00edguez was a top electoral official under Ch\u00e1vez, he secured for his sister a position in the president's office.",
      "But she advanced slowly at first and clashed with colleagues who viewed her as a haughty know-it-all.",
      "In 2006, on a whirlwind international tour, Ch\u00e1vez booted her from the presidential plane and ordered her to fly home from Moscow on her own, according to two former officials who were on the trip. Ch\u00e1vez was upset because the delegation\u2019s schedule of meetings had fallen apart and that triggered a feud with Rodriguez, who was responsible for the agenda.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to watch how Ch\u00e1vez talked about her,\u201d said one of the former officials. \u201cHe would never say a bad thing about women but the whole flight home he kept saying she was conceited, arrogant, incompetent.\u201d",
      "Days later, she was fired and never occupied another high-profile role with Ch\u00e1vez.",

      "Years later, in 2013, Maduro revived Rodr\u00edguez's career after Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer and he took over.",
      "A lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez speaks English and spent large amounts of time in the United States. That gave her an edge in the internal power struggles among Chavismo \u2014 the movement started by Ch\u00e1vez, whose many factions include democratic socialists, military hardliners who Ch\u00e1vez led in a 1992 coup attempt and corrupt actors, some with ties to drug trafficking.",
      "Her more worldly outlook, and refined tastes, also made Rodr\u00edguez a favorite of the so-called \u201cboligarchs\u201d \u2014 a new elite that made fortunes during Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian revolution. One of those insiders, media tycoon Raul Gorr\u00edn, worked hand-in-glove with Rodr\u00edguez's back-channel efforts to mend relations with the first Trump administration and helped organize a secret visit by Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican, to Caracas in April 2018 for a meeting with Maduro. A few months later, U.S. federal prosecutors unsealed the first of two money laundering indictments against Gorrin.",
      "After Maduro promoted Rodr\u00edguez to vice president in 2018, she gained control over large swaths of Venezuela's oil economy. To help manage the petro-state, she brought in foreign advisers with experience in global markets. Among them were two former finance ministers in Ecuador who helped run a dollarized, export-driven economy under fellow leftist Rafael Correa. Another key associate is French lawyer David Syed, who for years has been trying to renegotiate Venezuela\u2019s foreign debt in the face of crippling U.S. sanctions that make it impossible for Wall Street investors to get repaid.",
      "\u201cShe sacrificed her personal life for her political career,\u201d said one former friend.",
      "As she amassed more power, she crushed internal rivals. Among them: once powerful Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami, who was jailed in 2024 as part of an anti-corruption crackdown spearheaded by Rodr\u00edguez.",
      "In her de-facto role as Venezuela's chief operating officer, Rodr\u00edguez proved a more flexible, trustworthy partner than Maduro. Some have likened her to a sort of Venezuelan Deng Xiaoping \u2014 the architect of modern China.",
      "Hans Humes, chief executive of Greylock Capital Management, said that experience will serve her well as she tries to jump-start the economy, unite Chavismo and shield Venezuela from stricter terms dictated by Trump. Imposing an opposition-led government right now, he said, could trigger bloodshed of the sort that ripped apart Iraq after U.S. forces toppled Saddam Hussein and formed a provisional government including many leaders who had been exiled for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how expats who have been outside of the country for too long think things should be the way it was before they left,\u201d said Humes, who has met with Maduro as well as Rodr\u00edguez on several occasions. \u201cYou need people who know how to work with how things are not how they were.\u201d",
      "Where Rodr\u00edguez's more pragmatic leadership style leaves Venezuela's democracy is uncertain.",
      "Trump, in remarks after Maduro's capture, said Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado lacks the \u201crespect\u201d to govern Venezuela despite her handpicked candidate winning what the U.S. and other governments consider a landslide victory in 2024 presidential elections stolen by Maduro.",
      "Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela during the first Trump administration, said it is impossible for the president to fulfill his goal of banishing criminal gangs, drug traffickers and Middle Eastern terrorists from the Western Hemisphere with the various factions of Chavismo sharing power.",
      "\u201cNothing that Trump has said suggests his administration is contemplating a quick transition away from Delcy. No one is talking about elections,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cIf they think Delcy is running things, they are completely wrong.\u201d",

      "Sabalenka beat Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday to move into the Brisbane International quarterfinals, where she'll take on fifth-seeded Madison Keys almost a year after losing to her in the Australian Open final.",
      "Keys, her left leg heavily taped, came back from a set and a break down to beat 12th-seeded Diana Shnaider 6-7 (5), 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4) on Thursday.",

      "Keys had only two matches after her first-round exit at the U.S. Open, so she\u2019s looking for plenty of time on court before her title defense at the Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 18. Her career breakthrough at a major came at the expense of Sabalenka's bid for an Australian Open three-peat.",
      "Keys got more time on court in Brisbane than she bargained for in three tiebreakers, a medical timeout to have her upper left leg taped after the second tiebreaker, and a third set lasting 69 minutes.",
      "The American missed two match points in the 10th game of the third set but made sure of it in the deciding tiebreaker. It continued her winning streak in Australia that includes titles in Adelaide and at Melbourne Park in 2025.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always a little bit nerve-wracking getting back,\u201d Keys said. \u201cIt\u2019s (only) been like four weeks since we last played but it\u2019s just always kind of getting your feet wet again and trying to find some good level. Being able to win matches in Week 1 is always really important.\u201d",
      "Sabalenka started 2025 with a victory in Brisbane and ended it with a runner-up finish at the WTA Finals in November. She played 16 tournaments for a 63-12 record and capped the year in the Battle of the Sexes against Nick Kyrgios.",
      "After beating Cirstea, Sabalenka was asked whether as the No. 1 player she might try to manage her schedule like Serena Williams did at times.",
      "\u201cWell, the season is definitely insane, and that\u2019s not good for all of us, as you see so many players getting injured,\u201d Sabalenka said.",

      "Their dream was put in motion long ago by their father, who, appropriately enough, was born in a neighborhood known as Jamaica in Queens, New York. It's a dream that comes with significance, too: As Black ski racers in a predominantly white sport, the triplets see making this team as a way to open doors for more racers of color to follow in their tracks.",
      "The 18-year-olds born minutes apart in Brooklyn have been all over the globe competing in lower-tier races in an effort to qualify for the technical events, slalom and giant slalom. Henri already has a spot, in the slalom, and his sisters are close. The deadline is Jan. 18.",
      "\u201cIt would just be groundbreaking for three 18-year-old Black triplets to represent Jamaica, a non-snow sport country, on the global stage,\" Helaina said. \"I think about that every time I go to bed.\u201d",

      "\u201cSkiing,\" he said, \u201cgives you the power of freedom.\u201d",

      "They\u2019re close. Very close.",
      "The siblings were on skis around 18 months old, learning the basics on the slopes near their home in Windham, New York. They went to ski academies for high school, Helaina and Henniyah to the Holderness School in New Hampshire and Henri to Stratton Mountain School in Vermont.",
      "It's been an expensive endeavor to get here, on the cusp of the Olympics. A recent training block from July to December cost the family roughly $80,000.",

      "Authorities in the city of Catania have suspended or restricted excursions to see the volcano's lava flows, prompting guides to go on strike for the first time in decades and leaving disgruntled tourists with fewer options to see the spectacle up close.",
      "Dozens of the guides demonstrated Wednesday in front of Mount Etna\u2019s lava flow gate, calling the new restrictions excessive and saying the lava flows are slow-moving enough to be viewed safely as has been done in the past.",
      "\u201cThese measures effectively nullify the role of guides, stripping them of their skills, function, and professional responsibility,\u201d a statement by the guides\u2019 regional board said.",
      "The lava flows are especially spectacular after sunset, but under the new rules, excursions are allowed only until dusk and can go no closer than 200 meters (660 feet) to the lava flow. Also, a previously existing limit of 10 people per group is being vigorously enforced, including with drones.",
      "Mount Etna is Europe\u2019s most active volcano and the continent\u2019s largest. It attracts hikers and backpackers to its slopes, while less adventurous tourists can take it in from a distance, most stunningly from the Ionian Sea.",
      "At 3,350 meters (almost 10,990 feet) tall and 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) wide, the Sicilian giant frequently offers a front-row seat to nature\u2019s power. Last June, a massive eruption forced tourists to flee the volcano after a plume of high-temperature gases, ash and rock several kilometers high billowed into the air above them.",
      "The latest restrictions were adopted after Mount Etna started a round of eruptions on Christmas Eve.",
      "The most advanced lava front reached 1,360 meters (4,460 feet) above sea level, before stopping and entering a cooling phase after a journey of approximately 3.4 kilometers (about 2 miles), local authorities said.

      "Gadgets promoting a wide array of health benefits are on display at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Health tech gadgets displayed at the annual CES trade show make a lot of promises. A smart scale promoted a healthier lifestyle by scanning your feet to track your heart health, and an egg-shaped hormone tracker uses AI to help you figure out the best time to conceive.",
      "Tech and health experts, however, question the accuracy of products like these and warn of data privacy issues \u2014 especially as the federal government eases up on regulation.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced during the show in Las Vegas that it will relax regulations on \u201clow-risk\u201d general wellness products such as heart monitors and wheelchairs. It's the latest step President Donald Trump's administration has taken to remove barriers for AI innovation and use. The White House repealed former President Joe Biden's executive order establishing guardrails around AI, and last month, the Department of Health and Human Services outlined its strategy to expand its use of AI.",
      "Booths at the conference showcased new tech designed to help people living in rural areas with their health care needs amid doctor shortages, boost research into women\u2019s health and make life easier for people with disabilities.",
      "AI technologies have benefits in the over $4.3 trillion health care industry, according to Marschall Runge, professor of medical science at the University of Michigan. They\u2019re good at analyzing medical imaging and can help streamline doctors\u2019 busy schedules, but they can also promote biases and \u201challucinate,\u201d providing incorrect information stated as fact.",
      "\u201cI would urge people not to think that the technology is the same as a well-resourced, thoughtful, research-driven medical professional,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "Privacy protections like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act do not cover information collected by consumer devices, and the companies could be using the data to train their AI mode ls, or selling it to other businesses, Cohn said.",
      "With a lot of the gadgets at CES, it\u2019s difficult to find out where your information is going, Cohn said.",
      "\u201cYou have to dig down through the fine print to try to figure that out, and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair or right for the people who might rely on it,\u201d she said.",
      "But the creators of the products say their innovations fill in health care gaps, and they maintain they protect their customers\u2019 privacy.",
      "Sylvia Kang, founder and CEO of Mira, said she created the egg-shaped hormone tracker because many of her friends were trying to conceive and realized they had no knowledge of their hormonal health. To use the \u201cworld\u2019s mini hormone lab,\u201d you dip a wand in urine, insert the wand into the monitor and look at the results on the app.",

      "\u201cThere was no such thing before,\u201d Kang said of her $250 product.",
      "Many gadgets at CES focused on women\u2019s health, which has been historically under-researched and underfunded. Before 1993, women were excluded from clinical trials, and there still is little research on areas like menopause.",
      "While not every woman will have a baby, all women go through menopause, and \u201cyet we know nothing about it,\u201d said Amy Divaraniya, founder and CEO of the women\u2019s health company Oova, during a session.",
      "One gadget called Peri aims to better understand perimenopause \u2014 the transitional phase before menopause. The wearable device monitors hot flashes and night sweats and provides the data via an app.",
      "Other products at CES were promoted as a way to increase accessibility to health information. The free medicine-focused AI chatbot called 0xmd helps improve access to medical information in areas with doctor shortages and provides a cost-effective alternative, said its founder and architect Allen Au. People can ask the chatbot questions about medicine, upload photos of a mole or rash, and submit their doctors\u2019 notes for an easier-to-understand translation, Au said.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise...",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise now valued at $500 billion.",
      "Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.",
      "\u201cThis case is going to trial,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.",
      "The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.",
      "But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk \u2014 the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion \u2014 against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.",
      "\u201cPart of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said.",
      "It's unclear when the judge will schedule the trial.",
      "The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.",
      "Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.",

      "Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.",
      "A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.",
      "In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.",
      "One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",

      "\u201cThink of the car as having a soul and being an extension of your family,\u201d Sri Subramanian, Nvidia's global head of generative AI for automotive, said Tuesday.",
      "Subramanian's example, shared with a CES audience on the show's opening day in Las Vegas, illustrates the growing sophistication of AI-powered in-cabin systems and the expanding scope of personal data that smart vehicles may collect, retain and use to shape the driving experience.",
      "Across the show floor, the car emerged less as a machine and more as a companion as automakers and tech companies showcased vehicles that can adapt to drivers and passengers in real time \u2014 from tracking heart rates and emotions to alerting if a baby or young child is accidentally left in the car.",

      "That uncertainty is compounded by the uniquely personal nature of cars, Brookman said.

      "For travelers, CEO John Pfeifer says the goal is fewer delays without compromising safety. The technology is also designed to keep those tarmac tasks moving even during severe weather, like winter storms or extreme heat, when conditions are daunting for human crews, Pfeifer said. Testing with major airlines is already underway, and the robots would likely debut at large hub airports like Atlanta or Dallas, with a goal of rolling them out over the next few years.",

      "Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is under fire for generating sexualized images of women and children without consent",
      "LONDON -- Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is facing a backlash from governments around the world after a recent surge in sexualized images of women and children generated without consent by the artificial intelligence-powered tool.",
      "On Tuesday, Britain's top technology official demanded that Musk's social media platform X take urgent action while a Polish lawmaker cited it as a reason to enact digital safety laws.",
      "The European Union's executive arm has denounced Grok while officials and regulators in France, India, Malaysia and Brazil have condemned the platform and called for investigations.",
      "Rising alarm from disparate nations points to the nightmarish potential of nudification apps that use artificial intelligence to generate sexually explicit deepfake images.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look:",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. As of Tuesday, Grok users could still generate images of women using requests such as, \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "Nonprofit group AI Forensics said in a report that it analyzed 20,000 images generated by Grok between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1 and found that 2% depicted a person who appeared to be 18 or younger, including 30 of young or very young women or girls, in bikinis or transparent clothes.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, responded to a request for comment with the automated response, \u201cLegacy Media Lies\u201d.",
      "However, X did not deny that the troublesome content generated through Grok exists. Yet it still claimed in a post on its Safety account, that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, \u201cby removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "The platform also repeated a comment from Musk, who said, \u201cAnyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d",
      "A growing list of countries are demanding that Musk does more to rein in explicit or abusive content.",
      "X must \u201curgently\u201d deal with the problem, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Tuesday, adding that she supported additional scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom.",
      "Kendall said the content is \u201cabsolutely appalling, and unacceptable in decent society.\"",
      "\u201cWe cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls.\"",
      "Ofcom said Monday it has made \u201curgent contact\u201d with X.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "The watchdog said it contacted both X and xAI to understand what steps it has taken to comply with British regulations.",
      "Under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, social media platforms must prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it.",
      "A Polish lawmaker used Grok on Tuesday as a reason for national digital safety legislation that would beef up protections for minors and make it easier for authorities to remove content.",

The country's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also ordered the company to review Grok's \"technical and governance framework\" and file a report on actions taken.",
      "The ministry accused Grok of \u201cgross misuse\u201d of AI and serious failures of its safeguards and enforcement by allowing the generation and sharing of \u201dobscene images or videos of women in derogatory or vulgar manner in order to indecently denigrate them.\"",
      "The ministry warned failure to comply by the 72-hour deadline would expose the company to bigger legal problems, but the deadline passed with no public update from India.",
      "The Malaysian communications watchdog said Saturday it was investigating X users who violated laws prohibiting spreading \u201cgrossly offensive, obscene or indecent content.\u201d",
      "The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said it's also investigating online harms on X, and would summon a company representative.",
      "The watchdog said it took note of public complaints about X's AI tools being used to digitally manipulate \u201cimages of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, or otherwise harmful content.\u201d",
      "Lawmaker Erika Hilton said she reported Grok and X to the Brazilian federal public prosecutor\u2019s office and the country's data protection watchdog.",
      "In a social media post, she accused both of of generating, then publishing sexualized images of women and children without consent.",
      "She said X's AI functions should be disabled until an investigation has been carried out.",
      "Hilton, one of Brazil's first transgender lawmakers, decried how users could get Grok to digitally alter any published photo, including \u201cswapping the clothes of women and girls for bikinis or making them suggestive and erotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe right to one\u2019s image is individual; it cannot be transferred through the \u2018terms of use\u2019 of a social network, and the mass distribution of child porn(asterisk)gr(asterisk)phy by an artificial intelligence integrated into a social network crosses all boundaries,\" she said.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",
      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer service representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.",
      "Whatever the reason, the T1's ongoing absence from the smartphone market didn't come as a surprise to International Data Corp. analyst Francisco Jeronimo.",
      "\u201cWe have always been quite skeptical about this phone,\u201d Jeronimo said. \u201cThey are probably finding that it is harder to build a phone than they thought it would be. Let's see if this thing comes to life or not.\u201d",
      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "AI is the future of creativity.",
      "Certainly AI itself may be arguably creative, but the human mind is so unique that you definitely get new ideas that way. So I think the future is more of a hybrid approach, where content creators are working with AI to craft variations on a theme or to better monetize what they have to a broader audience.",
      "We\u2019re seeing all sorts of different devices that are implementing AI. But we have a special focus at this show, for the first time, on the disability community. Verizon set this whole stage up where we have all different ways of taking this technology and having it help people with disabilities and older people.",
      "Well, there\u2019s definitely no bubble when it comes to what AI can do. And what AI can do is perform miracles and solve fundamental human problems in food production and clean air and clean water. Obviously in healthcare, it\u2019s gonna be overwhelming.",
      "But this was like the internet itself. There was a lot of talk about a bubble, and there actually was a bubble. The difference is that in late 1990s there were basically were no revenue models. Companies were raising a lot of money with no plans for revenue.",
      "These AI companies have significant revenues today, and companies are investing in it.",
      "What I\u2019m more concerned about, honestly, is not Wall Street and a bubble. Others can be concerned about that. I\u2019m concerned about getting enough energy to process all that AI. And at this show, for the first time, we have a Korean company showing the first ever small-scale nuclear-powered energy creation device. We expect more and more of these people rushing to fill this gap because we need the energy, we need it clean and we need a kind of all-of-the-above solution.",

      "It\u2019s been a year of heartbreak and worry since the most destructive wildfires in the Los Angeles area's history scorched neighborhoods and displaced tens of thousands of people. Two wind-whipped blazes that ignited on Jan. 7, 2025, killed at least 31 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures, including homes, schools, businesses and places of worship. Rebuilding will take years.",
      "The disaster has brought another wave of trauma for people afraid of what still lurks inside their homes.",

      "They were forced to move back home in August anyway, after insurance cut off their rental assistance.",

      "\"I don\u2019t feel comfortable in the space,\u201d said Nina, whose neighbors' homes burned down across the street.",
      "They're not alone.",
      "According to a report released in November by the Eaton Fire Residents United, a volunteer group formed by residents, six out of 10 homes damaged from smoke from the Eaton Fire still have dangerous levels of cancer-causing asbestos, brain-damaging lead or both. That\u2019s based on self-submitted data from 50 homeowners who have cleaned their homes, with 78% hiring professional cleaners.",
      "Of the 50 homes, 63% have lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s standard, according to the report. The average lead levels were almost 60 times higher than the EPA's rule.",
      "Even after fires were extinguished, volatile organic compounds from smoke, some known to cause cancer, lingered inside of people's homes, according to a recent study. To mitigate these risks, residents returning home should ventilate and filter indoor air by opening windows or running high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers with charcoal filters.",
      "Zoe Gonzalez Izquierdo said she can\u2019t get her insurance company to pay for an adequate cleanup of her family's Altadena home, which tested positive for dangerous levels of lead and other toxic compounds.",

      "Experts believe the lead, which can linger in dust on floors and windowsills, comes from burned lead paint. The University of Southern California reported that more than 70% of homes within the Eaton Fire were built before 1979, when lead paint was common.",
      "\u201cFor individuals that are pregnant, for young children, it\u2019s particularly important that we do everything we can to eliminate exposure to lead,\u201d said pediatrician Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director for the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and a member of the climate group Science Moms.",

    "story": [
      "Georgia is the latest state to consider eliminating its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to phase it out by 2032",
      "ATLANTA -- Eliminating state income taxes sounds great to many voters, but Republicans backing the push in multiple states still face questions about whether such big tax cuts can be made without raising other taxes or sharply cutting state funding for education, health care and other services.",
      "Georgia on Wednesday became the latest state to launch a bid to abolish its personal income tax, with Republican leaders in the Senate backing a proposal to zero it out by 2032. This year, Georgia's personal income tax is projected to collect about $16.5 billion, or 44% of the state's general revenue.",
      "The push is driven by politics. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, the Republican who leads the state Senate, has made eliminating income taxes a centerpiece of his 2026 campaign for governor. State Sen. Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican who led a committee to abolish the tax, is among candidates to succeed Jones as lieutenant governor.",
      "\u201cThis is the first vote that we are going to get to take to address affordability,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal will pass. Georgia House Republicans may want to continue nibbling away at the tax in smaller bites, preferring a \u201cmeasured\u201d approach. Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington said Wednesday that his big 2026 goal is to eliminate property taxes for homeowners, but said he's willing to consider the Senate plan.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, serving his last year, has been cool to total elimination of the income tax. He declined to comment Wednesday on the Senate plan, but spokesperson Carter Chapman said Kemp wants \"to continue lowering taxes and putting more money in Georgians\u2019 pockets as he has throughout his term.\u201d",
      "The state's Democratic minority opposes the move, saying it would mostly benefit high earners and the state needs money to provide services.",
      "Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri have all set goals to abolish the personal income tax, joining eight other states that don't tax personal income. Eight other states besides Georgia are cutting personal income tax rates this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., group generally skeptical of higher taxes.",
      "\u201cWe've seen a lot of states cut their income tax rates in the last four or five years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and coming out of it,\u201d said Aravind Boddupalli, senior researcher at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C.",
      "Supporters say cuts help a state compete for new residents and businesses, pointing to growth in Texas and Florida, two states without personal income taxes.",
      "\u201cYour income tax is a tax on productivity,\u201d said Manish Bhatt, who studies state taxes for the Tax Foundation. \u201cIf you are taxing productivity, you are potentially losing out on economic gains.\u201d",
      "Georgia has already been cutting income taxes, taking what was once a top income tax rate of 6% and lowering it to a 5.19% flat rate. Republicans broadly support a further cut for individual and corporate taxpayers to 4.99% this year, worth an estimated $800 million in foregone tax revenue.",
      "The Senate plan would then freeze the corporate rate and focus on individual tax cuts. It proposes in 2027 to exempt the first $50,000 of income for a single person or $100,000 for a married couple, up from $12,000 and $24,000 now.",
      "Faced with Democratic criticism about affordability, the big increase in exempt income is central to Republicans' own arguments about how they can make money stretch farther. About 70% of Georgians reported less than $100,000 of taxable income in 2024, according to state figures.",

      "\u201cIt is a plan that gives benefits first to hardworking families,\u201d Tillery said.",
      "The initial rate cut, plus the exemption proposal, would lower Georgia revenue by $3.8 billion in its 2027 budget year. Tillery says the state could pay by using surplus tax revenue and shifting back to paying for capital expenditures through borrowing instead of cash. But those moves probably wouldn't cover the foregone revenue even in the first year, much less $13 billion more in cuts to get to zero.",
      "Tillery said revenue should be bolstered by trimming business income and sales tax breaks, saying legislators should reduce \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d But lawmakers and Kemp have balked at curtailing those measures in recent years.",
      "Tax cuts haven't always been a political bonanza. In Kansas, after Republicans under Gov. Sam Brownback cut income taxes steeply more than a decade ago, voters revolted at budget cuts and lawmakers imposed multiple tax increases to cover persistent budget shortfalls, including restoring some income tax cuts. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won her first term in 2018 by framing the race as a referendum on Brownback\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cState income taxes are only bad if you fundamentally don't believe that the services, the public investments that state governments provide, are worth anything,\u201d said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy .",
      "In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe and GOP legislative leaders have made phasing out the state\u2019s income tax a top priority for the session starting Wednesday. They're looking to expand sales taxes to services which currently are untaxed to help offset lost revenue.",
      "\u201cWe want to do this in a smart, efficient way that\u2019s not going to have the state go off some sort of fiscal cliff,\u201d Missouri House Majority Leader Alex Riley told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "But expanding sales taxes could fall more heavily on poorer taxpayers. The liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute estimated that if Georgia doesn't expand its sales tax, the combined state and local sales tax rate would have to rise sharply from the current 7.42% to recover revenue losses.",
      "All that leads to questions about income-tax elimination plans, even from Republicans. Burns, the Georgia House speaker, said he's \u201copen\u201d to any plan that benefits Georgians.",
      "\u201cBut we've got to have the details, and it has to work,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe need to make sure we can continue to do vital services \u2014 health care, public safety, education, all the things we talked about.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration will withdraw from dozens of international organizations, including the U.N.'s population agency and the U.N. treaty that establishes international climate negotiations, as the U.S. further retreats from global cooperation.",
      "President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies and commissions following his instructions for his administration to review participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House statement on social media.",
      "Most of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor and other issues that the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and \u201cwoke\u201d initiatives.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation\u2019s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,\u201d the State Department said in a statement.",
      "Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.",
      "The administration previously suspended support from agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO as it has taken a larger, a-la-carte approach to paying its dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies they believe align with Trump\u2019s agenda and those which no longer serve U.S. interests.",
      "\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is \u2018my way or the highway,\u2019\u201d Daniel Forti, senior U.N. analyst at the International Crisis Group, said. \u201cIt's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington\u2019s own terms.\u201d",
      "It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democratic \u2014 have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.",
      "Many independent nongovernmental agencies \u2014 some that work with the United Nations \u2014 have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration\u2019s decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Despite the massive shift, the U.S. officials, including Trump himself, say they have seen the potential of the U.N. and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.",
      "The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.",

      "Nebraska lawmakers are considering a motion to expel Sen. Dan McKeon over allegations of inappropriate behavior",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- On the first day of the 2026 legislative session, Nebraska lawmakers were asked Wednesday to consider a motion to expel a fellow senator accused of making a sexually-charged comment to a legislative staffer and touching her inappropriately during a session-end party last year.",
      "If lawmakers vote next week to expel the 59-year-old Sen. Dan McKeon, a Republican in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature, it will be the first time the body has ever done so.",
      "The unprecedented move follows a complaint from the staffer that McKeon said she should \u201cget laid\u201d on her vacation and patted her on her buttocks last May during a party at the Lincoln Country Club attended by state lawmakers, staffers and lobbyists.",
      "More attention has focused on sexual harassment within state legislatures nationwide. At least 156 state lawmakers across 44 states have been accused of sexual harassment or misconduct since 2017, when The Associated Press began tracking such incidents amid the #MeToo movement. Of those, 56 have resigned or been expelled from office. A nearly equal number have faced some other type of repercussion, such as losing committee or party leadership positions.",
      "A report on the Nebraska complaint was compiled by an outside law firm at the request of the Legislature's Executive Board and released Wednesday. It found that McKeon has \u201ca reputation for making jokes and that some of those jokes are unprofessional and/or inappropriate for the workplace.\u201d",
      "The report determined that McKeon's conduct did not rise to a level of sexual harassment or retaliation that is actionable under state or federal discrimination law, but that didn't mean it was acceptable. It said McKeon's conduct did violate the Nebraska Legislature's workplace harassment policy, and that lawmakers \u201cmay, in their discretion, censure, reprimand or expel the senator for his conduct and comments.\u201d",
      "After interviewing the woman, McKeon and others, the attorney who wrote the report found that the woman, McKeon and another staffer had been discussing vacation plans at the May 29 party when McKeon asked whether the woman was \u201cgoing to Hawaii to get laid,\u201d she said. McKeon characterized the remark as a joke in which he said he hoped she would get a Hawaiian lei while in Hawaii.",
      "\u201cComplainant was not vacationing in Hawaii so this comment was inconsistent with the discussion of vacation plans,\u201d the report said.",
      "The staffer also said McKeon patted her behind. McKeon initially denied touching the woman, the report said, but later said he may have touched her back or lower back \u201cor even rear end,\u201d but insisted it was not intended to be sexual.",
      "The report also said that following the complaint, McKeon was instructed by Sen. Ben Hansen, chairman of the Executive Board, on June 2 not to attend social gatherings where staffers would be present. Despite this, McKeon attended another party that night also attended by staffers \u2014 including the woman who filed the complaint against him \u2014 according to the report.",
      "Nearly a month later, urged by Hansen to \u201caccept responsibility for what he was alleged to have done\u201d McKeon sent the woman a note telling her she should find it within herself to forgive him \u201cbecause that is what the Bible instructs people to do,\u201d the report said.",

      "McKeon, who attended Wednesday's opening session, declined to comment on the report itself. But his remarks on the complaint against him and the possibility of being expelled were in line with the report's findings, falling back on religious references by saying that his name, Daniel, means \u201cjust\u201d in Hebrew and remarking \u201cwe're all sinners\u201d when asked about accusations that he's often made inappropriate jokes in the workplace.",
      "He said he has no plans to step down, despite calls from leaders of his own party \u2014 including Republican Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 to resign. But he seemed ready to accept that he might be forced out, saying he expects any vote in the full Legislature to \u201cbe pretty close.\u201d",

      "If McKeon is expelled, he would be the nation's 57th state lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct to have left office via expulsion or resignation since 2017.",

      "The U.S. population is projected to grow more slowly over the next 30 years than previously predicted",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. population is projected to grow by 15 million in 30 years, a smaller estimate than in previous years, due to President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies and an aging population, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.",
      "The nonpartisan budget office projected that U.S. population will grow from 349 million people this year to 364 million people in 30 years, a 2.2% smaller gain than it had predicted at this time a year ago. In September, the office issued a revised demographics report that showed Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations and other strict immigration measures would result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next 10 years.",
      "The country's total population is projected to stop growing in 2056 and remain roughly the same size as in the previous year, the CBO said. But without immigration, the population would begin to shrink in 2030 as deaths start to exceed births, making immigrants an increasingly important source of population growth, according to the report.",
      "The figures released Wednesday are used by the CBO for budget projections and economic forecasts.",
      "Even if the limits on immigration and increased deportations end with the Trump administration in three years, \u201cit\u2019s still a demographic shock,\u201d said William Frey, a demographer at the centrist Brookings Institution.",
      "Social Security and Medicare, which are already buckling under an aging population, will be under increasing pressure with even fewer than expected people in the labor force paying taxes. By the end of the decade, all of the nation\u2019s baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, will be over age 65.",
      "With fewer immigrants in the labor force and projections for U.S. fertility rates showing a long-term decline below replacement levels, \"that reduces the number of kids who are going to be born in that four-year period\u201d of the second Trump administration, Frey said.",
      "The latest numbers come as Trump has pushed for the largest mass deportation campaign in history. The CBO's numbers account for the success of those efforts in the first year of his second term in office.",
      "The administration has used a variety of methods to remove people from the country, including through a visa ban on applications for immigrants from some countries and deploying Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in U.S. cities to track down immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, included roughly $150 billion to ramp up his deportation agenda over the next four years. This includes money for extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall, building detention centers and adding thousands of law enforcement staff.",
      "When it comes to estimating the nation\u2019s population and future growth, immigration is always the wild card because it varies much more year to year than the number of births and deaths. Immigration has fueled U.S. population growth this decade because of an aging population and fertility lower than the replacement rate, with the number of deaths expected to start exceeding the number of births in about five years. The U.S. Census Bureau said that immigration increased by 2.8 million people in 2024 over the previous year.",

      "Cea Weaver, a longtime tenant activist, was tapped by the Democrat last week to serve as executive director of the Mayor\u2019s Office to Protect Tenants. The mayor has vowed to expand and empower the office to take \u201cunprecedented\u201d steps against negligent landlords.",
      "But in a sign of the high-level scrutiny on Mamdani's administration, Weaver\u2019s since-deleted posts have sparked condemnations from officials in the U.S. Department of Justice and the editorial board of The Washington Post.",
      "The posts, which were circulated on social media in recent days by critics of Mamdani, included calls to treat private property as a \u201ccollective good\u201d and to \u201cimpoverish the (asterisk)white(asterisk) middle class.\u201d A tweet sent in 2017 described homeownership as \u201ca weapon of white supremacy masquerading as \u2018wealth building public policy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Eric Adams, the city\u2019s former mayor and a fellow Democrat, said the remarks showed \u201cextreme privilege and total detachment from reality.\u201d",
      "Asked about the controversy on Wednesday, Mamdani did not address the substance of Weaver\u2019s posts but defended her record of \u201cstanding up for tenants across the city and state.\u201d",
      "Weaver said in an interview with a local TV station that some of the messages were \u201cregretful\u201d and \u201cnot something I would say today.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to make sure that everybody has a safe and affordable place to live, whether they rent or own, and that is something I\u2019m laser-focused on in this new role,\u201d she added.",
      "The discussion comes after Mamdani last month accepted the resignation of another official, Catherine Almonte Da Costa, after the Anti-Defamation League shared social media posts she made over a decade ago that featured antisemitic tropes.",
      "While Mamdani had said he was unaware of Da Costa's messages, Weaver\u2019s past social media posts were known to the administration, according to a mayoral spokesperson, Dora Pekec.",
      "Weaver previously led the Housing Justice for All coalition, which was widely credited with helping to convince state lawmakers to pass a sweeping package of tenant protections in 2019.",

      "As leader of the city's tenant protection office, she would play a key role in achieving one of Mamdani\u2019s most polarizing campaign pledges: identifying negligent landlords and forcing them to negotiate the sale of their properties to the city if they are unable to pay fines for violations.",
      "The \u201cpublic stewardship\u201d proposal has drawn consternation from landlord groups and skepticism from others in city government.",
      "But the early days of his administration have brought signs that the new mayor is not backing off on the idea.",
      "In a press conference immediately following his inauguration last week, Mamdani said the city would take \u201cprecedent-setting\u201d action against the owner of a Brooklyn apartment building that owed the city money and was currently in bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "He then announced Weaver\u2019s appointment, drawing loud cheers from the members of a tenants union gathered in the building's lobby.",
      "\u201cIt is going to be challenging,\u201d Weaver acknowledged. \u201cNew York is home to some of the most valuable real estate in the world. Everything about New York politics is about that fact.\u201d",

    "summary": "Alan Jackson, who famously won an acquittal in the murder trial of Karen Read and represented disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, did not explain his decision to withdraw.",
    "story": [
      "The attorney who was representing Nick Reiner, accused of killing his parents, filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer Michele Singer Reiner, unexpectedly withdrew from the case during what was supposed to be Nick Reiner's arraignment Wednesday, but made a bold declaration afterward: \"Take this to the bank. Pursuant to the law in California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder. Print that! Print that!\"",
      "Nick Reiner, 32, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, accused of\u00a0stabbing his parents to death\u00a0on Dec. 14 in their home in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. The L.A. County medical examiner\u00a0said\u00a0the Rob and Michele Reiner died from \"multiple sharp force injuries.\"",
      "Nick Reiner was supposed to enter a plea on Wednesday, but that arraignment was postponed when his defense attorney, Alan Jackson, told the court, \"We feel that we have no choice at this juncture, but to withdraw as counsel.\"",
      "The judge did not allow cameras to show Nick Reiner in court, but he stood shackled, head shaved and wearing a brown jumpsuit.",
      "Jackson, who famously won an acquittal in the murder trial of Karen Read and represented disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, did not explain his decision to withdraw from the case. Outside the courthouse, he told CBS News it was one of the most painful decisions he's ever made as a lawyer.",
      "Jackson said he was forced to withdraw due to \"circumstances beyond our control, but more importantly, circumstances beyond Nick's control,\" which \"have dictated that, sadly, it's impossible for us to continue our representation.\" He added that he was \"legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why.\"",
      "The L.A. County Public Defender's Office will take over for Jackson and his co-counsel. Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene will represent Nick Reiner, who will remain in custody until the new hearing date. He is being held without bail and his arraignment has been rescheduled to Feb. 23.",
      "L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said after the hearing that he was \"fully confident\" Nick Reiner would be found guilty of the charges against him.",
      "If convicted, Nick Reiner could face a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, and the district attorney's office has indicated it may also seek the death penalty, but no final decision has yet been made.",

    "summary": "The funeral for Brigitte Bardot was private, but hundreds poured into the streets of Saint-Tropez to pay their respects to an icon of the 1960s silver screen.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 Brigitte Bardot's funeral was being held on Wednesday with a private service and a public homage in Saint-Tropez, the French Riviera resort where she lived for more than half a century after retiring from movie stardom at the height of her fame.",
      "The animal rights activist and far-right supporter died on Dec. 28 at the age of 91 at her home in southern France.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron said after her death that France was \"mourning a legend.\"",
      "She died from cancer after undergoing two operations, her husband, Bernard d'Ormale, said in an interview with Paris Match magazine released Tuesday evening. \"She was conscious and concerned about the fate of animals until the very end,\" he said.",
      "Residents and admirers applauded the funeral convoy as the coffin of Bardot, once one of the world's most photographed women and a defining screen siren of the 1960s, was being carried through the town's narrow streets.",
      "A service started to the sound of Maria Callas' \"Ave Maria\" at the Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption Catholic Church in the presence of Bardot's husband, son and grandchildren, as well as guests invited by the family and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered in the small town to follow the farewell on large screens set up at the port and on two plazas.",
      "After the church service, Bardot is to be buried \"in the strictest privacy\" at a cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Saint-Tropez town hall.",
      "She had long called Saint-Tropez her refuge from the celebrity that once made her a household name.",
      "A public homage will take place at a nearby site for admirers of the woman whose image once symbolized France's postwar liberation and sensuality.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most dazzling ambassador,\" the town hall said last week. \"Through her presence, personality and aura, she marked the history of our town.\"",
      "Bardot settled decades ago in her seaside villa, La Madrague, and retired from filmmaking in 1973 at age 39, during an international career that spanned more than two dozen films.",
      "She later emerged as an animal rights activist, founding and sustaining a foundation devoted to the protection of animals.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest recognition.",
      "While she withdrew from the film industry, she remained a highly visible and often controversial public figure through decades of militant animal rights activism and links with far-right politics.",
      "She will be buried in the so-called marine cemetery, where her parents are also interred.",
      "The cemetery, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, is also the final resting place of several cultural figures, including filmmaker Roger Vadim, Bardot's first husband, who directed her breakout film \"And God Created Woman,\" a role that made her a worldwide star.",

      "In an interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Glaser described the process of making jokes for the awards show as \"strategic,\" saying, \"you have to be very delicate about making jokes that aren't going to ruin anyone's night, but you also want to give the people at home \u2026 something to laugh at and you want to poke fun at the people that they're dying for you to make fun of.\"",
      "She added picking the perfect jokes for the show is \"one of \u2026 the most difficult jobs I've ever done.\"",
      "Glaser said she is a big fan of the celebrities up for awards and said this year is a little different because she grew up admiring many of the actors.",
      "\"It is easy for me to take down like, you know, the newer batch of actresses and actors who are younger than me. It is like, OK I can make fun of you, I'm like a veteran. But when it's like people I grew up admiring it's \u2026 oh, my gosh, it is so much \u2026 it is a different approach this year.\"",
      "While preparing last year, Glaser reached out to some celebrities to see if a joke went too far. She said she hasn't done this yet so far and may have a different strategy.",
      "\"There are certain people that I don't know what I would say. It is almost like some of these jokes, you think about, OK, if I got their number, would I write them and ask them? Then I go, you know what? They might say no and I know the joke isn't that mean, and \u2026 I would rather ask for forgiveness later at the after-party when they're drunk,\" she said with a laugh.",

      "\"I'm trying out my monologue around L.A. at the clubs here, and just even any joke about Julia Roberts, they're not there for.

    "story": [
      "Countless young dancers have followed in the footsteps of Carmen de Lavallade, the Grande Dame of American dance who's among those receiving Kennedy Center honors in Washington tonight. She's been shattering barriers almost all her life, as Rita Braver now shows us:",
      "The elegant 86-year-old in pink putting young members of the Dance Theatre of Harlem through their paces (\"Lighten up!\") just happens to be one of the pioneers of American Modern Dance: Carmen de Lavallade.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it always that you have hoped that audiences would get from seeing you dance over the years?\"",
      "\"The connection,\" she replied. \"Because I don't feel that I'm there just dancing for myself, you know? I'm dancing for the audience.\"",
      "The remarkable journey of this California bricklayer's daughter is being saluted this weekend with a Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "It's a story that begins when even getting dance lessons was a challenge, as she described in her 2014 one-woman show: \"In those days, there were very few people who would take you if you were colored,\" she recalled. \"And if you did get into a dance studio, the white students would walk out.\"",
      "But her talent triumphed. While still in high school, de Lavallade won a place in a prestigious L.A. dance company. And she didn't go alone. She was joined by a high school friend who turned out to be a pretty good dancer himself: Alvin Ailey.",
      "De Lavallade introduced Ailey to the world of dance, and they were partners for years.",
      "In 1954 they were invited to perform in \"House of Flowers,\" an all-black Broadway show. But it was a cast member from Trinidad who won her heart: Geoffrey Holder. They were married within three months.",

      "\"I must say that he allowed me to be who I am. We didn't get in each other's way.\"",
      "Holder became a Tony Award-winning director (for \"The Wiz\") who often created both dances and costumes for his wife. The mementos of their life together are stored in a cavernous Harlem warehouse. \"I lived with this all my life,\" de Lavallade mused.",
      "Since Holder's death in 2014, de Lavallade  and her son, Leo, have been cataloging every piece -- letters, photos, costumes and clothes -- and recalling the stories that go with them, some of them bittersweet.",
      "In 1961 de Lavallade, by then an international sensation, was to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "But she was not allowed to perform with the white dancer she was working with at the time.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:28:58 -0500",
    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:16:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "New Year's Day commemorates the passing of time and the start of a new chapter, so it is fitting that the same day also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into thousands of creative works nearly a century old. As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, have entered the the public domain.",
      "They join a growing list of cultural icons that are no longer under copyright protection, including Popeye the Sailor Man and the \"Steamboat Willie\" version of Mickey Mouse.",
      "List of popular intellectual property entering the public domain in 2026",
      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections have expired for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are now available for free use by anyone:",

      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "summary": "New research recommends against drinking coffee or tea served by airlines, urging travelers to stick to bottled water.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:11:22 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:40:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"people live in homes, not corporations,\" in announcing plans to bar big investors from home purchases.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, claiming the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and that action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House declined to provide more information on Mr. Trump's plans for restricting large investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

      "Prime benefits include services such as free two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming and Amazon Music.",

      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-airlines-pilot-jet-panel-blew-out-sues-boeing/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",

    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

      "Representatives from petroleum giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are planning to meet with the Trump administration later this week to discuss Venezuela, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The meeting is expected to take place Wednesday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is attending the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami, a Department of Energy spokesperson said.",
      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Bethany Williams said the trade group is \"closely watching developments involving Venezuela.\"",

    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

      "Energy industry stocks and oil prices are rising after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and his wife in a military operation on Saturday.",
      "In Wall Street trading on Monday, shares in Chevron \u2014 the only U.S. oil company\u00a0operating in Venezuela\u00a0\u2014 jumped $7.95, or 5.1%, on the day to close at $163.85. Exxon Mobil's stock increased 2.2%, and ConocoPhillips gained 2.6%",
      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",
      "Venezuela produces thick crude with high amounts of sulfur and metal that is widely used to produce diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, among other uses.",
      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",
      "\"Crucially, we already expect lower oil prices to drive a modest decline in domestic U.S. oil production into 2027, and so the broader backdrop is hardly conducive to large-scale investments in new high-cost wells in Venezuela,\" he said in a client note.",

    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise.

    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "summary": "Grok, the chatbot developed by Elon Musk's company xAI, said it is fixing \"lapses in safeguards\" after social media users said it was generating sexualized photos of minors.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming. Without strong safeguards and independent detection, manipulated media can \u2014and will \u2014 be weaponized,\" Copyleaks said in a blog post.",
      "\"Spicy mode\" controversy",
      "Grok has previously drawn scrutiny before for generating sexually inappropriate content. Grok Imagine, xAI's artificial intelligence video generation platform,\u00a0unveiled \"Spicy Mode\" last year, framing it as a way for creators to tell \"edgier\" and \"more visually daring narratives.\"",
      "However, when a news writer for The Verge tested the technology in August, she said the AI model generated unprompted nude deepfakes of Taylor Swift.",
      "\"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,\" Alon Yamin, CEO and co-founder of Copyleaks, said in the company's post.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",
      "BusinessesSecurities such as stocks and bondsArtCollectiblesIntellectual property",
      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax. He had previously resided in San Francisco.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla on Friday reported a second straight annual drop in electric vehicle sales, as the phaseout of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit and mounting competition weighed on demand. With the decline, Tesla lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker.",
      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.",
      "Cheaper Tesla models",
      "The latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-war-powers-vote-trump-venezuela-maduro/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:06:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The previous two measures fell short of GOP support needed for passage. The third vote comes days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is expected to take a third vote today on another war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to strike Venezuela as the U.S. leader continues to take unilateral action against the South American country.",
      "The vote, scheduled for late Thursday morning, comes days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife in a nighttime raid that came not only as a surprise to the former president, but also to Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump had long teased land strikes against Venezuela amid a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats at sea that has killed more than 100 people. Mr. Trump has not ruled out additional military action. He has said that the U.S. will \"run\" the country for the time being and control its oil sales after Saturday's strikes on Venezuela, which were carried out as part of a daring operation to capture Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face charges.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, introduced his latest resolution in early December, after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "\"The indication from the administration [is] that this is not a few days or a few weeks, it's likely a few years of U.S. occupation and involvement in this country,\" Kaine said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"This is not an arrest warrant. This is far bigger than that.\"",
      "Without additional Republican support, the measure is expected to meet the same fate as the previous failed two efforts spearheaded by Kaine to restrict military action in the region.",
      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, held briefings for top lawmakers on Tuesday on last weekend's actions in the region. They held similar briefings for all members of Congress on Wednesday.",
      "Democrats left those briefings dissatisfied with the answers they received about what comes next.",
      "The boat strikes and Maduro's seizure and removal to the U.S. have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers, with some accusing the Trump administration of committing war crimes, lying about its intentions for regime change and leading the U.S. into a war without congressional authorization.",
      "\"I think bombing a capital and removing the head of state is by all definitions, war,\" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone Republican cosponsor of the resolution, said Tuesday.",
      "Members of the Trump administration, including the president, have muddied the legal arguments by claiming that the operation to capture Maduro was a \"law enforcement\" operation that didn't require sign-off from Congress. Mr. Trump and other officials also say the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela.",
      "Many Republicans have defended the Trump administration's failure to seek approval from Congress, arguing the actions are well within the president's constitutional authority and limited in scope.",
      "\"This is not a regime change. This is demand for change of behavior by a regime,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said after Monday's classified briefing. \"We don't expect troops on the ground.\"",
      "Johnson added Wednesday, \"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. There's no dispute about that, of course, but we are not in a war in Venezuela.\"",
      "Boat strikes scrutinized",
      "In the weeks before Maduro's capture, Mr. Trump dialed up his pressure campaign, seizing two sanctioned tankers that were carrying oil from Venezuela. On Wednesday, the U.S. carried out operations to seize two more vessels linked to Venezuela.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has voted against the war powers resolutions, suggested that if the U.S. can seize a giant oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, it could also seize smaller boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "\"I would take note, if we can take a big ship like this, we may be able to take a few boats, too, without blowing them out of the water,\" he told reporters last month. \"But that's a decision they have to make on the ground, I guess, based on the threat level.\"",
      "Paul, who has been a fierce critic of the strikes and has decried the lack of due process, shared a letter he received from the U.S. Coast Guard that said dozens of suspected drug smuggling vessels interdicted by the military branch possessed no illegal drugs. In total, 212 interdictions occurred between Sept. 1, 2024, and Oct. 7, 2025, according to the letter. Of those, 41 boats had \"no illicit contraband on board when interdicted,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "The letter also provided details on interceptions in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"Of the 212 total vessels interdicted during this period, 69 vessels were interdicted in the Caribbean Sea by Coast Guard surface assets, operating under Coast Guard law enforcement authority,\" the letter continued. \"Of these 69 interdictions, 14 had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted; 11 of those 14 vessels without contraband did not appear to commit any federal criminal offense. Of the 69 Caribbean interdictions, 14 vessels were indicted off the coast of Venezuela. Three of the 14 vessels interdicted near Venezuela had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted, but one of the three violated other U.S. federal criminal statutes.\"",
      "To justify the strikes, the Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. Lawmakers critical of the military action argue the rationale in the opinion is inadequate for the situation and have demanded that it be made public.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" perhaps seeking to bolster the justification for military action around Venezuela.",
      "Fentanyl was not mentioned in the indictment against Maduro.",
      "Grace  Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                                  Ibrahim  Aksoy\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Video from the scene, along with statements from witnesses and local officials, disputes the accounts of federal officials regarding the circumstances that led up to the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman Wednesday morning during an operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota, local and federal officials have confirmed.",
      "The shooting comes as the Trump administration has deployed about 2,000 federal immigration and investigative agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as part of a crackdown on the state's fraud scandal and immigration.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump described the shooting as self-defense, but the mayor and governor disputed that, citing videos from the scene.",
      "Woman who was shot was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen",
      "The city of Minneapolis said police responded to a call reporting a shooting at about 9:30 a.m. local time to a south Minneapolis neighborhood and found that a woman in a vehicle had been shot in the head.",
      "Minneapolis firefighters rushed the woman to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died, the city said.",
      "The woman who was killed was identified to CBS News by a U.S. official as 37-year-old Renee Good. She was a U.S. citizen, federal sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "City leaders said Good was a legal observer of federal actions in the city and wasn't a target for an ICE-related arrest.",
      "Old Dominion University President Dr. Brian Hemphill said in a statement that she\u00a0graduated from the school in December 2020 with an English degree.",
      "Feds say she was shot during \"targeted operations\" by ICE",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement that the shooting occurred while ICE officers were conducting \"targeted operations.\"",
      "McLaughlin described the woman who was killed as one of several \"violent rioters\" who were \"blocking\" ICE officers.",
      "According to McLaughlin, the woman \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.\"",
      "An ICE officer, \"fearing for his life,\" then \"fired defensive shots,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "In a news conference following the shooting, Noem described the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\"",
      "Noem alleged the ICE officers had gotten stuck in snow and \"were attempting to push out their vehicle\" when \"a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"",
      "In a post on Truth Social, also claiming that the shooting was self-defense, Mr. Trump alleged that the woman \"viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" before being shot. However, a video clip from a local newscast that Mr. Trump attached to the post showed no sign that an officer had been run over.",
      "Officer part of an ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations team",
      "The name of the officer has not been released. Two federal sources told CBS News the agent who discharged his weapon was an immigration agent with an ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations team.",
      "Noem said the officer was taken to the hospital after the shooting and has since been released.",
      "\"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and drug him with a car back in June,\" Noem said. \"He sustained injuries at that time as well.\"",
      "Video, witness accounts and local and state officials challenge federal claims",
      "Statements from witnesses and local officials, who point to several videos of the encounter, dispute the accounts from federal officials of the circumstances that led up to the shooting.",
      "In a fiery news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey contested McLaughlin's narrative that the shooting was an act of self-defense, calling the federal government's account \"bull****.\"",
      "\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bulls***,\" Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "In another news conference, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had seen the video as well and also challenged the account of self-defense.",
      "\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz said. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"",
      "One video taken by a man at the scene and provided to CBS Minnesota shows the woman in a maroon Honda Pilot SUV blocking the street with her car. An ICE agent walks behind the car and circles around to the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "In another angle, she can be seen apparently attempting to wave someone to go around her before two agents then park their silver pickup truck and get out, walking towards the Honda's driver-side door.",
      "In that video, one of the officers from the pickup truck can be heard telling the woman to \"get out of the f****** car\" as he approaches. He reaches for the Honda's door handle and the car starts moving in reverse. As the Honda is reversing, another agent moves in front of the vehicle from the opposite side. The Honda then starts to move forward, and the agent in front of the vehicle draws his weapon and fires into the Honda.",
      "That agent then moves to the side of the car, although it's unclear if he was hit or not, and fires two more shots as the car continues moving forward.",
      "The videos show the SUV driving off a bit further before crashing into another car down the street.",
      "Multiple witnesses reaffirmed what was seen in the videos and told CBS Minnesota that whistles had sounded to alert neighbors of ICE's presence at about 9:30 a.m.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are jointly investigating the shooting.",
      "Shooting prompts local outrage",
      "In his news conference Wednesday, Frey had a blunt message to federal immigration officers, \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "\"They are not here to cause safety in this city. What they are doing is not to provide safety in America. What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust,\" the mayor said.",
      "About 1,500 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations agents and 650 Homeland Security Investigations agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities in recent weeks, CBS News has learned, an increase 15 times the normal ICE presence in the region.",
      "Walz in his news conference said the state \"doesn't need any further help from the federal government.\"",
      "\"To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you've done enough,\" Walz said.",
      "The governor also directed the Minnesota National Guard to prepare in the event that it was need to assist state and local authorities amid the fallout from the shooting.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a statement that \"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Mr. Trump's decision to send thousands of federal agents to Minnesota is \"causing serious harm and spreading terror\" through the community.",
      "Minneapolis Public Schools announced late Wednesday that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes would be canceled districtwide for all schools both Thursday and Friday \"due to safety concerns related to today's incidents around the city.\" All after-school activities and athletics would be canceled as well.",

      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social he \"appreciated [Petro's] call and tone,\" adding that the two leaders are planning to meet at the White House at some point. The U.S. president said Petro called \"to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had.\"",

      "Petro said in a post on X that he and Mr. Trump discussed their disagreements over \"his vision of the relationship between the United States and Latin America.\" He said he believes the United States can partner with the region on energy, fueled by billions in U.S. investments, but the U.S. shouldn't use the region exclusively for oil.",
      "Petro included an image of a jaguar and a bald eagle embracing. The Colombian leader has repeatedly warned in recent months that U.S. strikes on Colombia would \"awaken the jaguar.\"",

He denounced the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug boats in a September speech before the United Nations, and days later, he said during a New York protest rally that members of the U.S. military should \"disobey the orders of Trump.\" The State Department revoked Petro's visa in response, calling his actions \"reckless and incendiary.\"",
      "The tensions have ratcheted up since the U.S. military's overnight capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro over the weekend, which Petro denounced as an act of \"aggression.\"",
      "A day after the operation, Mr. Trump expressed ire toward Petro, telling reporters: \"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long.\"",
      "Asked whether that means there could be some kind of U.S. operation in Colombia, Mr. Trump responded, \"It sounds good to me.\"",
      "Petro \u2014 a former member of a guerrilla group and Colombia's first leftist leader in decades \u2014 responded forcefully early Monday morning. He wrote on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tom Homan, President Trump's former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director and current border czar, said he hasn't seen any clear examples of excessive force displayed by ICE agents and officers.",
      "His comment comes on the day an ICE officer fatally shot a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis.",
      "In the months since Mr. Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants began, video has circulated of a mother being tackled by an ICE agent, while tear gas was used in a Chicago residential neighborhood and car windows have been smashed to grab drivers. There have also been videos showing federal agents use chokeholds on protesters.",
      "\"I have not seen ICE act out outside of policy,\" Homan said in an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. \"If they are acting outside of policy, I'm not aware of it. There'll be an investigation. They'll be held accountable.\"",
      "After being shown video of Wednesday's shooting in Minneapolis, Homan said he wouldn't comment on it, citing the active investigation.",
      "\"I'm not going to make a judgment call on one video when there's a hundred videos out there, I wasn't on the scene. I'm not an officer that may have body cam video,\" he said. \"It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation. Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.\"",
      "Homan said that when he hears an allegation, he follows up and makes sure everything is investigated, though he acknowledged that he's not aware of every ICE arrest.",
      "Dokoupil pressed Homan, saying most Americans, having seen videos of ICE in action, would question Homan's claims.",
      "But Homan said he has faith in ICE agents to do the right thing.",
      "\"And if they don't, they'll be held accountable,\" he said.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday night, he said, \"The incident in Minneapolis today is yet another tragic example of the results of the hateful rhetoric and violent attacks against the men and women of ICE and BP. These brave men and women are forced to conduct law enforcement operations in heightened threat environments every day. Like all Americans, our officers have a right to self defense.\"",
      "Under federal guidelines, use of force is authorized \"only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist,\" according to Department of Homeland Security policies.",
      "Mr. Trump in November told 60 Minutes that ICE raids \"haven't gone far enough.\" He said he was OK with the tactics because \"you have to get the people out,\" describing many of them as murderers and criminals, even though many of the people who have been arrested by ICE and deported don't have a criminal record.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers linked to Venezuela \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean Sea, officials said.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure\u00a0of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.",
      "Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Night Stalkers.\"",
      "The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month.",
      "U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was \"conducting illicit activities\" and operating in international waters.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. \"for final disposition,\" according to U.S. Southern Command.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as \"back-to-back\" and \"meticulously coordinated,\" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.",
      "The Marinera, formerly Bella-1",
      "The Marinera \u2014 which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department \u2014 was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading.",
      "A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Noem said the tanker \"has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. \"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" she said.",
      "Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been \"granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,\" \"In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" the ministry said.",
      "The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping\u00a0lists\u00a0the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "Maduro has rejected U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and accuses the U.S. of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement.",

      "The 2026 military budget is set at $901 billion. Mr. Trump's proposal would represent a 66% jump in funding.",
      "Mr. Trump called for the massive surge in spending days after he ordered a U.S. military operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and spirit him out of the country to face drug trafficking charges in the United States, following a months-long military buildup in the region and a series of strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats. U.S. forces continue to mass in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "In recent days, the president has floated military action or pressure in other countries, part of an interventionist strategy in the Western hemisphere that he calls the \"Don-roe Doctrine.\" He has called for taking over the Danish territory of Greenland for national security reasons and has suggested he's open to carrying out military operations in Colombia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ominously warned that longtime adversary Cuba \"is in trouble.\"",
      "\"This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\" Mr. Trump said in a posting on Truth Social announcing his proposal.",
      "The military just received a large boost of some $175 billion in the GOP's \"big, beautiful bill\" of tax breaks and spending reductions that Mr. Trump signed into law last year.",
      "Insisting on more funding for the Pentagon is almost certain to run into resistance from Democrats who work to maintain parity between changes in defense and non-defense spending. But it's also sure to draw objections from the GOP's deficit hawks who have pushed back against larger military spending.",
      "But Mr. Trump said he feels comfortable surging spending on the military because of increased revenue created by his administration through tariffs imposed on friends and foes around the globe since his return to office.",
      "The U.S. government collected gross revenues of $288.5 billion last year from tariffs and other excise taxes, up from $98.3 billion in 2024, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That's a meaningful increase in revenues from taxing imports. But it's not enough to cover the various promises made by the president, who has said the tariffs can also cover dividends to taxpayers, pay down the national debt and, now, cover increased spending on the military.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump on Wednesday also threatened to cut off Pentagon purchases from Raytheon, one of the biggest U.S. defense contractors, if the company did not end the practice of stock buybacks and invest more profits into building out its weapons manufacturing capacity.",
      "Mr. Trump in recent months has repeatedly complained that defense companies have been woefully behind on deliveries of critical weaponry, yet continue to mete out dividends and stock buybacks to investors and offering eye-popping salaries to top executives.",
      "\"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War,\" the president said on social media. \"Also, if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government, under no circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks, where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars, until they are able to get their act together.\"",

      "\"The states that are affected are not affected because they're Democratic. They're affected because they refuse to cooperate with developing plans that would end the fraud.

      "The Illinois Department of Human Services said it has not yet received any notification or communication about impacts to its federal funding.",
      "\"This is yet another politically-motivated action by the Trump Administration that confuses families and leaves states with more questions than answers. IDHS will provide an update if it is made aware of program or funding changes,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration comes after HHS announced last week that it froze federal child care funding for Minnesota because of \"blatant fraud\" in public-assistance programs.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered \"large-scale fraud\" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",
      "CBS News visited several of the centers named by Shirley and found that all but two of the facilities have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "President Trump has criticized Minnesota leaders for its handling of the scandal and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked California, led by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, as \"more corrupt\" than Minnesota. He said Tuesday in a Truth Social post that \"the fraud investigation of California has begun.\" The president has not provided evidence of wide-scale fraud in California social services and did not provide further details about a probe involving the state.",
      "Beyond Minnesota, the Trump administration has also not put forth evidence of sweeping fraud schemes in social services in New York, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "Still, over the past several months the Trump administration has turned off the spigot of funding to Democrat-led states and cities, particularly during the historic government shutdown last year. Mr. Trump paused billions of dollars for infrastructure and climate projects, and slashed disaster preparedness grants.",
      "Democrats have accused the administration of playing politics with money that has been approved by Congress.",

      "HHS announced on Tuesday that it's halting $10 billion in federal funding for social services programs in those five states, citing allegations of fraud. The decision came on the heels of the agency's decision to freeze child care funding for Minnesota because of widespread fraud, which you can read more about here.

      "Washington \u2014 It may be a \"better thing\" if fewer children receive the flu vaccine, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told CBS News, after the Trump administration announced sweeping changes to childhood vaccine recommendations.",
      "This week, the Centers for Disease Control\u00a0announced vaccines to fight respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease,\u00a0flu, and COVID are now recommended only for children at high risk of serious illness or after consultation between doctors and parents, as a part of the CDC's scaling back of key childhood vaccination recommendations. Until recently, the CDC recommended that everyone 6 months and older get the annual flu vaccine.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy.",

      "\"So fewer people will get the flu vaccine?\" Cordes asked.",
      "\"Well, that may be, and maybe that's a better thing,\" Kennedy said.",
      "\"Based on what evidence?\" Cordes pressed. \"There are 280, 290 kids who died last year due to the flu. There's no evidence that any kids died or were harmed due to the  flu vaccine. So isn't this inevitably going to lead to more children dying?\"",
      "Kennedy said the Cochrane Collaboration, a U.K.-based health care research nonprofit that he called \"one of the ultimate arbiters of vaccine safety and clinical data,\" has done an extensive meta-review of the flu vaccine. Kennedy said they found \"there is no evidence that the flu vaccine prevents serious disease or that it prevents hospitalizations or death in children.\"",
      "But that isn't regarded by the medical community as the only authority on vaccines, and the CDC as recently as last year\u00a0touted other studies\u00a0that found the flu vaccine significantly reduced a child's risk of dying from the flu and reduced the risk of an intensive care hospital stay.",

      "\"What we're stressing is that people should be eating protein,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes.",
      "Trump administration officials unveiled the dietary guidelines on Wednesday. The guidance encourages Americans to steer clear of ultra-processed foods and added sugars and to prioritize protein, dairy, fruit, vegetables, healthy fats and whole grains. It lists red meat as one source of protein, and says meat can be flavored with \"salt, spices, and herbs.\"",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Kennedy argued protein and healthy fats were \"wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines,\" saying: \"We are ending the war on saturated fats.\"",
      "The American Heart Association lauded the new guidelines for discouraging processed foods and encouraging whole grains, fruits and vegetables. It also called protein \"an essential component of a healthy diet.\"",
      "But the group said it's concerned the mentions of red meat and salt \"could inadvertently lead consumers to exceed recommended limits for sodium and saturated fats, which are primary drivers of cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "The American Heart Association has long said that excessive saturated fat consumption can raise people's LDL cholesterol levels, leading to a higher risk of heart disease. The group emphasized Wednesday that it believes people should try to get protein from lean meats and seafood, and to limit their red meat consumption.",
      "Asked about that criticism, Kennedy insisted to Cordes that \"there is no good evidence that saturated fats drive cardiac disease,\" calling it \"dogma\" based on an older study.",
      "He noted that the guidelines still advise people to keep saturated fat at 10% of their daily caloric intake, which he called \"pretty low.\" The 10% recommended limit also appears in the government's prior nutrition guidelines.",

      "The U.S. military action removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power divides Americans, and their views on it connect to what they think the U.S. goals are and what they believe comes next.",
      "At the moment, most think the Trump administration is among other aims trying to get access to Venezuela's oil and expand U.S. power in the region \u2014 and when Americans think those are big parts of the goals, they tend to disapprove.",
      "When people think the goals are a lot about stopping drugs, gangs and terrorists, they are more approving.\u00a0 That view is largely voiced by Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who think this action will make the U.S. stronger, and they give the operation overwhelming support.",
      "Either way, that mix of perceptions is partly because most Americans say the administration hasn't clearly explained the U.S.' plans with Venezuela.",
      "Looking ahead, the public expresses uncertainty about what happens now with the U.S. military and Venezuela. Those who think U.S. military involvement will be limited are more approving of the action than those who now foresee a lot of involvement.",

      "MAGA's views on Venezuela operation",
      "Even more MAGA Republicans support the action now than supported the idea of it back in November.",
      "There are at least two reasons: one is that they overwhelmingly call the operation a military success, whereas other Americans frequently say it's too soon to evaluate.",
      "Another is that they see more impact: MAGA Republicans are especially apt to say this will stop drugs, make the U.S. position in the world stronger, and get other countries in the region to cooperate with the U.S.",
      "Other Americans, by contrast, are more mixed on those implications.",
      "For context, MAGA Republicans also overwhelmingly approved of the U.S. bombing in Iran last summer.",
      "Impact of Maduro's removal from power on U.S. standing",
      "U.S. military and involvement from here",
      "On balance, many more call the specific operation that removed Maduro a success than not, but nearly half feel it is too soon to say. That may depend on what they think happens from here.",
      "Very few want the U.S. to have a lot of control over Venezuela now.",
      "Most do not support further military action if Venezuela does not cooperate with U.S. interests. Nor would they back taking military action in other countries in the region if those countries are not seen as cooperating with the U.S.",
      "But Republicans stand apart here \u2014 particularly most of the MAGA base: Most would support further military actions in either of those cases.",
      "In the region",
      "President Trump",
      "Somewhat more people approve of the military action to remove Maduro than approve of the president's handling of the situation with Venezuela more generally; the latter tracks more closely to his overall approval, and his overall approval hasn't changed since before this action.",
      "While they still don't give it wide approval, some groups do rate Maduro's removal a little more highly compared to how they rate the president's job performance overall. Hispanics are divided about the action to remove Maduro in the same split as Americans overall. Slightly more independents approve of removing Maduro than approve of Trump overall.",
      "Congress' role",
      "Looking at the role of Congress: just as before the action, when most Americans said Mr. Trump needed congressional approval for military action in Venezuela, so today do most Americans think Congress would need to approve any further military action there.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,325 U.S. adults interviewed between January 5-7, 2026.

      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday formally invited President Trump to deliver the State of the Union before a joint session of Congress on Feb. 24, he announced.",
      "\"Together in 2025, your administration and the 119th Congress delivered one of the most consequential agendas in history, and Americans across this great country will experience the tangible results of commonsense governance,\" Johnson wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump. \"We look forward to advancing the important work ahead of us in 2026, serving the American people, defending liberty, and preserving this grand experiment in self-governance.\"",
      "Republicans control the House and Senate and are working to hold onto their majority in the lower chamber in the November midterm elections.",
      "Johnson's formal invitation to Mr. Trump comes after he said in response to a question from CBS News that the State of the Union was likely to take place Feb. 24, but said the address hadn't yet been officially scheduled.",
      "\"We were looking at some alternative dates and trying to figure out what works,\" Johnson said at a news conference. \"But I think that's the week that we're in session in mid-to-late February and that would be the preference of the White House.\"",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, added, \"wait for further development\" but \"it's coming.\"",
      "The address will mark Mr. Trump's first State of the Union address of his second term. Last year, Mr. Trump addressed a joint session of Congress in March, but it was not considered a formal State of the Union address.",
      "During their first year, president typically address a joint session of Congress early on in their tenure to outline a vision or agenda, before delivering State of the Union addresses to lawmakers in subsequent years.",

    "summary": "The House Oversight Committee held a hearing on a series of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes in Minnesota\u200b, with testimony from state lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a series of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes in Minnesota, with testimony from state lawmakers who alleged officials resisted efforts to address systemic financial impropriety.",
      "\"Minnesota social services, which are funded by you, the American taxpayer, are being ripped off,\" Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican and chairman of the committee, said as he kicked off the hearing. \"The breadth and depth of this fraud is breathtaking, and I fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The panel heard from four witnesses: GOP state Reps. Kristin Robbins, Walter Hudson and Marion Rarick, along with Brendan Ballou, a former prosecutor for the Justice Department who is appearing as the Democrats' witness.",
      "Asked how fraud became so widespread in Minnesota, Hudson said that \"when people recognized that the system wasn't working and they raised those concerns, those concerns were ignored and a culture suppressing raising those concerns was fostered by the Walz administration,\" referring to Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "Republican officials have argued for years that Minnesota was slow to act in what federal prosecutors described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\" The issue saw a resurgence late last year, and it hasn't gone away. Republicans have cited the scandal to put pressure on Walz, who announced this week that he was ending his bid for a third term.",
      "In December, Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz's handling of the fraud cases. Comer has invited the Minnesota governor and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to testify before the committee next month, and has said the committee would subpoena them if they don't appear voluntarily.",
      "\"Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minnesota's Democrat leadership have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in these crimes,\" the chairman said. \"We must expose this theft of taxpayer dollars and hold everybody accountable who let it happen.\"",
      "The fraud hearing",
      "The three Republican state lawmakers testified about their concerns regarding the treatment of rampant fraud in Minnesota, while outlining the work they've undertaken in the state to bring it to light.",
      "Robbins said, as chair of a fraud prevention committee in the Minnesota House, she's been \"working to uncover the massive fraud under Tim Walz, propose solutions and hold state agencies accountable.\" She alleged that Walz and his administration \"have willfully turned a blind eye to crime in the face of countless whistleblower and auditor reports.\"",
      "\"The time for accountability and justice is here,\" Robbins said.",
      "Robbins outlined that the committee has identified fraud in multiple Medicaid programs, including autism centers, sober homes, non-emergency medical transportation, integrated community supports and housing stabilization. And she said her committee held a hearing last month on \"credible allegations of fraud in two new areas,\" pointing to adult day services and assisted living.",
      "Robbins also testified that her committee has evidence that, as far back as 2012, money has been sent back to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab. The Treasury Department said last month that it would\u00a0investigate\u00a0whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia.",
      "Robbins claimed that there is \"a network of people who have been politically supporting the Democrats, who have also been contributing to them, and who have been involved in multiple schemes.\"",
      "Hudson argued that the \"recent national conversation about fraud in Minnesota has been fraught with distractions, diverting from critical concerns regarding process, policy and oversight, to sideshow concerns about personalities and partisan politics.\" He said he hoped to provide a \"clear picture of a culture which has developed over many years.\"",
      "\"The full scope of the problem is not just criminal fraud, but a culture of profiting from government programs in perpetuity,\" Hudson said. \"Not as a safety net, but as an industry.\"",
      "During questioning, Comer asked Hudson: \"Why would Gov. Walz let $9 billion in fraud occur?\"",
      "\"In my opinion, because it was politically beneficial to Democrats. Again, the Somali community is a huge constituency group, and we've had some tight races in Minnesota, and it makes a difference for them,\" Hudson said.",
      "Rarick testified about whistleblowers who she said face a \"constant fear of retaliation\" that has \"intensified under an avalanche of fraud in Minnesota.\" She alleged that the Walz administration \"seriously retaliated against whistleblowers.\"",
      "Ballou, the former DOJ prosecutor and the minority's witness, said he's fearful of \"selective interest in fraud in America,\" saying \"at the same time that these crimes are rightly being investigated by state and federal authorities, the larger infrastructure for prosecuting fraud and white-collar crime is being dismantled.\"",
      "Democrats on the committee acknowledged concerns about fraud, but underlined that the response should not punish communities unjustly, while pointing to what they said was hypocrisy from their GOP colleagues when it comes to taking fraud allegations seriously.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the panel's top Democrat, acknowledged the dangers and prevalence of fraud in his opening statement, but said that \"what we should not do is use fraud as an excuse to rip away aid from innocent people who follow the rules and need help in our society.\"",
      "Garcia cited the administration's plans to\u00a0halt billions of dollars in federal funding\u00a0for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud.",
      "\"Republicans want to cut benefits and attack states with Democratic governors,\" Garcia said. \"And when it's done \u2014 particularly in places like Minnesota \u2014 it has unleashed bigotry and hate.\"",
      "What to know about Minnesota fraud",
      "Federal law enforcement officials say a litany of social service programs in Minnesota were targeted by fraudsters, including child nutrition, autism services and housing stabilization programs, in what one prosecutor described as \"industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "Some 92 people have faced federal charges so far, with 62 convicted.",
      "The scandal began with allegations that people bilked nearly $250 million from a program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children during the pandemic. Dozens of people have been convicted or pleaded guilty to collecting reimbursements for meals that weren't actually served.",
      "Prosecutors have also charged over a dozen people with submitting phony reimbursements to a now-defunct program that helped seniors and people with disabilities find housing \u2014 including two Pennsylvanians who allegedly traveled to Minnesota in what officials described as \"fraud tourism.\" And a program that funds therapy for children with autism was allegedly hit with fraud.",
      "And a conservative YouTuber alleged nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any services. Some of the day care centers and state regulators have pushed back on those allegations.",
      "Walz has faced criticism for his handling of the fraud schemes, with watchdog agencies and Republican lawmakers arguing the state government missed warning signs and moved too slowly to shut down fraudulent payments.",
      "The governor has long defended his handling of the crisis, arguing he has moved quickly to halt fraud and refer people for criminal prosecution.",
      "Walz cited the fraud earlier this week in his decision to\u00a0end his gubernatorial bid, acknowledging that in recent years, \"an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity.\" He added that \"even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\"",
      "President Trump has focused on the fact that most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing backlash from local officials like Walz, who called the president's comments \"vile, racist lies and slander.\"",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that the U.S. has a three-phase plan for Venezuela, with an initial emphasis on stabilizing the country.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the Trump administration has \"tremendous leverage\" over Venezuela because of the U.S. \"quarantine\" of sanctioned oil, and said the U.S. will control how money from sales of Venezuelan oil is disbursed.",
      "Rubio told reporters after briefing senators on the administration's involvement in Venezuela that the U.S. has a \"three-fold process\" that involves stabilization of the country, recovery and transition following the ouster of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We don't want it descending into chaos,\" he said.",
      "Rubio said the Trump administration's \"quarantine\" of sanctioned Venezuelan oil gives the U.S. the \"strongest leverage possible.\" He said the Trump administration is going to first be taking between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold \"at market rates.\" Crude oil prices have hovered around $60 a barrel in recent days.",
      "\"That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime, so we have a lot of leverage to move on the stabilization front,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the barrels will arrive in the U.S. \"very soon.\"",
      "\"The United States government has already begun marketing Venezuelan crude oil in the global marketplace for the benefit of the United States, engaged the world's leading commodity marketers, key banks to execute and provide financial support for these crude oil and crude product sales,\" she said.",
      "Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state oil company, confirmed that it is in negotiations with the U.S. for the sale of oil \"within the framework of the existing trade relations between the two countries.\"",
      "\"This process is being carried out under similar schemes to those in place with international companies, such as Chevron, and is based on a strictly commercial transaction, with criteria of legality, transparency, and benefit for both parties,\" the firm said in a statement. \"PDVSA reaffirms its commitment to continue building alliances that promote national development for the benefit of the Venezuelan people and that contribute to global energy stability.\"",
      "The second phase of the administration's plan, recovery, involves ensuring American, Western and other companies have access to the Venezuelan market \"in a way that's fair,\" as well as national reconciliation and amnesty for opposition forces, Rubio said. The third phase will then be transition, though the secretary of state did not provide details as to what they may entail.",
      "\"We feel like we're moving forward here in a very positive way,\" Rubio said.",
      "He said U.S. sanctions on Venezuela oil provide \"tremendous leverage,\" as the South American country's interim leaders \"cannot move any oil\" unless allowed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"There is a process now in place where we have tremendous control and leverage over what those interim authorities are doing and are able to do,\" he said. \"Obviously this will be a process of transition. In the end, it will be up to the Venezuelan people to transform their country.\"",
      "Senior administration officials, including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have been dispatched to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers about its plans for Venezuela after Maduro was deposed in an overnight operation\u00a0early Saturday.",
      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were brought to the U.S. to face drug-trafficking and weapons offenses. They pleaded not guilty Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump said in announcing Maduro's ouster that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, but did not provide details as to the extent of a U.S. commitment. Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice president under Maduro, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the deal for 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil Tuesday night and said it would be controlled \"by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\"",
      "He said Energy Secretary Chris Wright would organize the process of transferring the oil from Venezuela to the U.S. Wright said earlier Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuelan oil sales \"indefinitely.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and the second in the Caribbean Sea \u2014 that are linked to Venezuela. With the latest seizures, the U.S. has now detained four tankers tied to the country.",
      "While Mr. Trump has said U.S. energy companies would play a central role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry,\u00a0experts told CBS News it would take years for foreign oil companies to build out operations.",

      "\"We will deliver severe consequences in Minnesota and stand ready to deploy to any other state where similar fraud schemes are robbing American taxpayers,\" Bondi said.",
      "The Justice Department has intensified efforts to investigate fraud in the state after a social media video shared by YouTuber Nick Shirley went viral right before New Year's Day. Shirley alleged in the video that nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any child care services.",
      "The video has been praised by Bondi, as well as Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk.",
      "The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families has since cast doubt on the accuracy of the video, saying that a review by the state's Office of Inspector General found that nine of the centers were \"operating as expected.\"",
      "A separate CBS analysis, meanwhile, found that all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "One of the Minneapolis day care centers featured in Shirley's video is now closed, according to state records. Quality Learning Center closed Tuesday, according to the Minnesota Department of Human Services' licensing records. CBS station WCCO is investigating the reason for the closure, which is not yet publicly known. The center's last licensing review in June found operational violations but noted no evidence of fraud.",

      "The COVID fraud scheme has centered on a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future, and has led to charges against more than 75 defendants.",
      "The group, which works with restaurants and caterers to distribute meals to schools, was accused of sending fake meal-count sheets and invoices.",

The new dietary recommendations are a part of the president's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda.",

      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul said Wednesday he opposes any U.S. military action in Greenland as the White House says it is exploring all options for acquisition of the territory.",
      "\"It won't happen under my watch,\" Paul said on \"CBS Mornings\" about military action in Greenland. \"I will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland.\"",
      "The Kentucky senator, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has long opposed offensive U.S. military action overseas. He voted to advance a war powers resolution, which would have limited the president's authority to continue a military campaign in Venezuela, but Senate Republicans blocked the measure. The Trump administration did not seek congressional approval before launching last week's strikes. The Senate is expected to bring up a war powers resolution again this week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of President Trump's interest in Greenland that he and his team are \"discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal.\"",
      "Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. A lawmaker and a source familiar with the discussions said Secretary of State Marco Rubio told members of Congress at briefing Tuesday that Mr. Trump would buy Greenland and not take it by force.",
      "Paul did not raise an objection to purchasing Greenland, noting that the U.S. has acquired territory in the past.",
      "\"Half of the United States came to us through the Louisiana Purchase,\" Paul noted. \"Alaska came to us through a purchase. But you didn't get to those purchases like any deal or diplomacy by insulting your opponent. You get there by actually trying to please and get your opponent to agree to this, because it would have to be done voluntarily.\"",
      "Paul said that this type of action in Greenland would have to be initiated by a vote from its more than 50,000 citizens declaring their independence from Denmark, adding, \"I think the people of Greenland are inclined to do\" this.",
      "That would also have to be followed by \"some sort of offer of something that makes it better to be a part of the United States,\" he continued.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the strikes in Venezuela, Paul suggested it marked the beginning of the \"Don-roe doctrine,\" leading to questions about expansion extending to other territories, including Greenland and Canada.",
      "Paul said that he had \"never thought about\" taking Greenland, but \"now that it's been brought up, if you want to effect that, you don't do it by beating people up the same way, like in regard to Canada.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to Canada the \"51st state\" and imposed punishing tariffs against the U.S.' northern neighbor, raising tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Paul said he's been consistent about his opposition to military action overseas, and he stressed the importance of maintaining Congress' constitutional authority to declare war.",
      "\"I think that this is an important debate to have,\" Paul said. \"Doesn't mean I have anything against President Trump. It doesn't mean that I don't even dislike the result of (former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s) Maduro gone \u2026 But I do think the constitutional debate is an important one.\"",

    "story": [
      "European leaders released a joint statement Tuesday, outlining the importance of Arctic security, but stressing that \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" hours after White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said it was \"the formal position of the U.S. government... that Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Miller also said, in an interview Monday with CNN, that \"the United States is the power of NATO. For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous  territory of Denmark, and has been tied to the small European nation for 300 years, though it has its own elected government. The largest island in the world, it is located to the northeast of Canada and is about the size of  Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to  only around 60,000 people.",
      "Its  location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both  economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said in their joint statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. The United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally and through the defense agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951,\" the U.S. allies said.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.",
      "\"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told local media on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO, and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday if the U.S. would use military force to take over Greenland, Miller told CNN: \"The United States should have Greenland as part of the United States. There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking, of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers pushed back against the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steny H. Hoyer and Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, said in a joint statement that \"sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous.\"",
      "They said any U.S. attack on Greenland \"would tragically be an attack on NATO.\"",
      "\"We already have access to everything we could need from Greenland,\" the two lawmakers said, noting that Denmark's government has already given the U.S. permission to deploy additional military forces there, or to build more missile defense infrastructure on the island.",

    "summary": "Aldrich Ames was a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Aldrich Ames, a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia, has died, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson.",
      "Ames, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died Monday at the age of 84 at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland.",
      "The 31-year veteran of the CIA is believed to have compromised more than 100 intelligence operations and sent a number of Soviet agents to their deaths or prison, as he traded information for large sums of money that funded his lavish lifestyle.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ames admitted that he compromised \"virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me\" as well as giving the Soviet Union and Russia a \"huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies.\" Ames divulged the identities of 10 agents, and at least nine of them were executed, according to the Defense Department.",
      "There were a number of red flags throughout Ames' career \u2014 lie detector tests that showed deceptive answers, sudden unexplained wealth, poor job performance, alcohol abuse \u2014 but the CIA repeatedly missed or ignored the warning signs and promoted him to increasingly sensitive posts.",
      "Born in River Falls, Wisconsin, in 1941, Ames spent part of his childhood in Southeast Asia while his father worked for the CIA.",
      "After graduating high school and failing out of classes at the University of Chicago, Ames joined the CIA in 1962, performing clerical duties. At the same time, he attended George Washington University, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history.",
      "In 1969, he married his first wife, who also worked for the CIA, and accepted his first assignment abroad in Ankara, Turkey, where he targeted Soviet spies for recruitment. But he was sent back to CIA headquarters in Virginia after three years when his job performance declined.",
      "Back in the U.S., Ames' problems with alcohol began to surface at work and his marriage fell apart.",
      "Ames went alone to his assignment in Mexico City, where he worked from 1981 to 1983. There, he met his next wife, Rosario, a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Colombian Embassy and a CIA asset, who would later be charged as his accomplice.",
      "Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase on a train in New York that contained classified materials that could have compromised a Soviet asset, and his superiors' concerns about his heavy drinking, Ames was promoted to chief of the Soviet branch of the counterintelligence division.",
      "By then, financial pressure was building on Ames. The divorce from his first wife had left him in debt and he had new bills to pay once Rosario came to live with him.",
      "So, in 1985, he approached the Soviets, giving them the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. He later gave the KGB a list of CIA assets, dealing \"a crippling blow\" to the agency's Soviet operations, according to a 1994 Senate Intelligence Committee report. The KGB promised to give him more than $2 million for his cooperation. To tamp down suspicions about his newfound wealth, he told colleagues that Rosario came from a wealthy family.",
      "He continued spying for nine more years, including in Rome, where he served from 1986 to 1989. From 1990 to 1994, he oversaw operations in Western Europe and Czechoslovakia and worked for the CIA's counternarcotics center, traveling to meet his handlers in Vienna, Bogota and Caracas.",
      "Meanwhile, the CIA and FBI were looking for the source of the damaging compromises. In 1993, the mole hunt closed in on Ames. Investigators surveilled him for months, arresting him on Feb. 21, 1994, in Arlington, Virginia, days before he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow.",
      "Nearly two months later, Ames and his wife pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their espionage activities. Ames' wife was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "Then-CIA Director R. James Woolsey\u00a0said Ames was \"a malignant betrayer of his country who killed a number of people who helped the United States and the West win the Cold War.\" Those agents died, Woolsey said, because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar.\"",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0New York Times after his arrest, Ames explained his decision to start spying for the other side, saying money was the main motivator. But he also said the seed was planted when he regularly had lunch with a correspondent of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in the 1970s. The Soviet threat was not as great as the U.S made it out to be, he determined.",
      "\"I know what's damaging and I know what's not damaging, and I know what the Soviet Union is really all about, and I know what's best for foreign policy and national security,\" he told the New York Times. \"And I'm going to act on that.\"",

    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

    "summary": "The hydrogen cloud is a remnant of the universe's early formation, NASA said in a news release.",
    "story": [
      "A team of researchers discovered a new type of astronomical object that may help experts learn more about the formation of galaxies and the development of the early universe.",
      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",
      "Cloud-9 may continue to change and could even grow into a galaxy if it continues to expand, NASA said.",

The motorist then put her vehicle into reverse, then into drive. Witnesses said they then heard three shots fired. The Honda traveled another several feet before crashing into another vehicle.U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem characterized the driver's actions as an \"act of domestic terrorism.\" Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security's assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a statement Wednesday morning the victim was \"one of these violent rioters\" who \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them \u2014 an act of domestic terrorism.\" However, videos posted to social media of the deadly encounter corroborate witness accounts.

      "Their conversation came hours after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis. Cerna said he couldn't comment on the investigation but called it \"a tragic event.\"",
      "Here are five takeaways from their conversation:",
      "On the tension around ICE in cities across the country",
      "Dokoupil noted the tension and turmoil surrounding ICE action across the U.S. and asked: \"Are you concerned that the mission of ICE may not be able to be carried out in a way that is both effective and safe for everyone involved?\"",
      "Cerna said \"that's a concern every day that we face,\" but added that he's not concerned that the mission can't be accomplished because \"we are committed to this public safety mission.\"",
      "On masking",
      "Cerna said ICE officers are wearing masks for their protection and for the protection of their families, citing doxing and harassment.",
      "\"We all took an oath to serve this country and to enforce immigration laws,\" he said. \"And that's all we're doing.\"",
      "On anger towards ICE",
      "Dokoupil asked: \"What do you think explains the public anger there is towards ICE?\"",
      "\"I really don't know,\" Cerna said. \"I just think that the public might not have all the information that they need to know as far as the type of work that we're doing, the criminal aliens that we're getting off the streets and we're moving back to their home countries. A lot of times, you know, all that is missed but we are doing a lot of great work.\"",
      "On controversial ICE videos",
      "Dokoupil asked Cerna what he'd say to the public about videos that appear to show ICE using excessive force, including using pepper balls and dragging protesters.",
      "Cerna said there's often \"more to what is on that video,\" including whatever happened beforehand and commands given by ICE officers.",
      "\"What's happening right now is\u2026I guess since we're ICE officers, they don't, they don't feel that we have the authority that we actually do have.\"",
      "Dokoupil noted that ICE is getting larger, not smaller, and asked how the agency will carry out its mission \"in a way that is safer and less tumultuous than it is right now.\"",
      "Cerna said it's a \"hard question\" and that ICE officers train to \"make arrests in the safest way possible\" but that people \"are being more reckless when we're trying to make those arrests.\"",
      "\"Now, what a lot of people don't understand is \u2026 there might be someone that we're, we've targeted, we've identified, we've located that individual, and now we're making an arrest. And that person, you know, might just be facing a removal back to their home country. But when they recklessly ram into our vehicles, now they're assaulting an officer\u2026 They're putting themselves in danger and \u2026 they're putting themselves in more of a risk to getting prosecuted for that assault.\"",
      "His message to Americans",
      "When asked what he wants every American to know, Cerna said: \"We're all part .. of this community. I mean, we're, we're fathers, we're mothers, we're brothers, we're sisters. We have a family, and all we're doing is we're, we're enforcing the immigration laws as they're written and, you know, that's all we're doing \u2026 we took an oath to do this, this mission, and that's what we're doing, and we're doing it to the best of our ability.\"",

      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for 66 organizations, agencies, and commissions, following his administration's review of participation in and funding for all international organizations, including those affiliated with the United Nations, according to a White House release.",
      "Many of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor, migration and other issues the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and \"woke\" initiatives. Other non-U.N. organizations on the list include the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, and the Global Counterterrorism Forum.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from organizations that foster cooperation among nations to address global challenges comes as his administration has launched military efforts or issued threats that have rattled allies and adversaries alike, including capturing autocratic Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and indicating an intention to take over Greenland.",
      "The administration previously suspended support for agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. It has taken a larger, \u00e0 la carte approach to paying dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies it believes align with Mr. Trump's agenda and those that no longer serve U.S. interests.",
      "\"I think what we're seeing is the crystallization of the U.S. approach to multilateralism, which is 'my way or the highway,'\" said Daniel Forti, head of U.N. affairs at the International Crisis Group. \"It's a very clear vision of wanting international cooperation on Washington's own terms.\"",
      "It has marked a major shift from how previous administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democratic \u2014 have dealt with the U.N., and it has forced the world body, already undergoing its own internal reckoning, to respond with a series of staffing and program cuts.",
      "Many independent nongovernmental agencies \u2014 some that work with the United Nations \u2014 have cited many project closures because of the U.S. administration's decision last year to slash foreign assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Despite the massive shift, Trump administration officials say they see the potential of the U.N. and want to instead focus taxpayer money on expanding American influence in many of the standard-setting U.N. initiatives where there is competition with China, like the International Telecommunications Union, the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization.",
      "The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.",
      "UNFCCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Mr. Trump \u2014 who calls climate change a hoax \u2014 withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.",
      "Gina McCarthy, former White House national climate adviser, said being the only country in the world not part of the treaty is \"shortsighted, embarrassing, and a foolish decision.\"",
      "\"This Administration is forfeiting our country's ability to influence trillions of dollars in investments, policies, and decisions that would have advanced our economy and protected us from costly disasters wreaking havoc on our country,\" McCarthy, who co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned U.S. states and cities, said in a statement.",
      "Mainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.",
      "The U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it \"gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.",
      "It will also be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without cooperation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said.",
      "The U.N. Population Fund, the agency providing sexual and reproductive health worldwide, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition, and Mr. Trump cut funding for it during his first term. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in \"coercive abortion practices\" in countries like China.",
      "When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support GOP claims.",
      "Other organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies, and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.",

Pursuant to the law in California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder. Print that! Print that!\"",
      "Nick Reiner, 32, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, accused of\u00a0stabbing his parents to death\u00a0on Dec. 14 in their home in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

      "Jackson, who famously won an acquittal in the murder trial of Karen Read and represented disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, did not explain his decision to withdraw from the case. Outside the courthouse, he told CBS News it was one of the most painful decisions he's ever made as a lawyer.",

    "summary": "The new dietary guidelines recommend limits on added sugars and mention gut health. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has unveiled a new food pyramid and dietary guidelines for Americans that call for \"prioritizing high-quality protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains\" while avoiding highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.",
      "\"As secretary of Health and Human Services, my message is clear: Eat real food,\" HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at a White House briefing announcing the changes alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and other health officials. Kennedy called it \"the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News the new guidelines are \"science-driven.\" In a fact sheet, the administration said the new guidelines would restore \"science and common sense\" and put \"real food back at the center of health.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the new dietary guidelines.",
      "First recommended limits on highly processed foods",
      "For the first time, the recommendations are calling for Americans to avoid eating\u00a0highly processed foods.",
      "A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 55% of the U.S. population receives more than half of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. The previous 2020-2025 dietary guidelines did not mention highly processed or ultra-processed foods.",
      "The new guidelines call for avoiding \"highly processed packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet,\" as well as avoiding sweetened beverages including soda, fruit drinks and energy drinks.",
      "Research has shown\u00a0diets high in ultra-processed food are associated with an increased risk of 32 damaging health outcomes, according to a review published in\u00a0The BMJ\u00a0medical journal in 2024.",
      "Limits on sugars, artificial flavors and dyes",
      "The guidelines also say that \"no amount of added sugars\" are recommended for Americans, especially children.",
      "At most, a meal should contain no more than 10 grams of added sugars, according to the new guidance. The former guidance said children under 2 should\u00a0not consume added sugars and that Americans should aim to have less than 10% of their daily calories come from added sugars.",
      "People should also limit foods and beverages that include\u00a0artificial flavors, dyes, low-calorie non-nutritive sweeteners and artificial preservatives, the new guidelines said.",
      "Naturally occurring sugars are not considered added sugars and can be part of a recommended diet under the new guidelines.",
      "Fighting chronic disease and supporting gut health",
      "Dietary guidelines are used as the baseline for federal food programs, including SNAP and school meal programs. The fact sheet for the new guidelines says public adherence to the new guidelines \"will dramatically lower chronic disease \u2014 and healthcare costs \u2014 for Americans.\"",
      "The fact sheet said the U.S.'s high level of health-related spending and a life expectancy that is five years less than other developed countries is \"predominantly due to chronic conditions tied to food.\" It also said that lowering rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease would cut about $600 billion in annual healthcare costs. Previous studies have also shown a possible link between diet and Alzheimer's.",
      "\"The most expensive thing we can do as a country is continue government incentives for food that sickens Americans and drives up healthcare costs,\" the fact sheet said.",
      "The new guidelines point out the importance of gut health\u00a0and the microbiome inside a person's intestines. The gut microbiome includes trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi whose balance is important for good health. The new guidelines call for the consumption of vegetables, fruits, fermented foods and high-fiber foods to support a diverse gut microbiome.",
      "\"Ending the war on healthy fats\"",
      "The fact sheet for the new guidance calls for \"ending the war on healthy fats\" and getting the bulk of dietary fats from whole food sources. That includes meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, full-fat dairy and avocados, the guidelines say.",
      "People should aim for three servings of dairy a day, in line with the 2020-2025 guidelines. The new guidelines say people should prioritize full-fat options, while the previous guidelines recommended fat-free or low-fat products.",
      "The new guidelines also recommend olive oil, butter or beef tallow for preparing meals. Kennedy has previously criticized seed oils and extolled tallow, at odds with long-standing recommendations.",
      "\"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said.",
      "In total, saturated fat consumption should not exceed more than 10% of a person's daily calories, according to the new guidelines. The 2020-2025 guidelines also had similar recommended limits on saturated fats, though they noted a \"healthy dietary pattern\" could include vegetable oils.",
      "A focus on protein and \"real\" foods",
      "The new guidelines recommend \"high-quality, nutrient dense protein foods\" including eggs, poultry, seafood, red meat, and plant-based proteins like beans, nuts and seeds in every meal.",
      "Under the guidelines, Americans should aim to eat 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight every day. Proteins should be served with no or limited added sugars, chemical additives, refined carbohydrates or starches, the guidelines say.",
      "\"What we're stressing is that people should be eating protein,\" Kennedy said in an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary noted at the briefing that the new guidelines increase the recommended amount of protein for children.",
      "\"Kids need protein,\" Makary said. \"The old protein guidelines were to prevent starvation and withering away. These new protein guidelines are designed for American kids to thrive.\"",
      "Fruits, vegetables and whole grains",
      "The new guidelines also recommend people eat at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit per day, in line with the previous 2020-2025 dietary guidance.",
      "People should eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, preferably in their original form. Frozen, dried or canned products with no or very limited added sugars \"can also be good options,\" according to the fact sheet. People should limit consumption of 100% fruit or vegetable juices.",
      "Americans should also prioritize fiber-rich whole grains and reduce the consumption of highly processed, refined carbs, the guidelines say. People should aim for between two and four servings of whole grains per day.",
      "A new food pyramid",
      "Officials released a new version of the food pyramid, with protein, dairy, healthy fats making up one of the top corners, fruits and vegetables in the other, and whole grains at the bottom.",
      "Consume less alcohol",
      "The guidelines recommend that Americans should \"consume less alcohol for better overall health.\"",
      "People in certain categories are urged to completely avoid alcohol, including pregnant women, people who are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are unable to control the amount they drink, and people taking medications or with medical conditions that can interact with alcohol.",
      "Previous guidelines said that Americans should not drink or drink in moderation. The recommended limits were 2 drinks or less per day for men and 1 drink or less per day for women on days when alcohol is consumed.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the new guidelines are meant to encourage moderation but acknowledge the social benefits that some may experience.",
      "\"There is alcohol on these guidelines, but the implication is don't have it for breakfast,\" Oz said.",
      "Reactions to new dietary guidance",
      "The American Medical Association said in a statement that it \"applauds\" the Trump administration's new dietary guidelines.",
      "\"The guidelines affirm that food is medicine and offer clear direction patients and physicians can use to improve health,\" Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, the president of the AMA, said in the statement. Kennedy thanked Mukkamala in his briefing.",
      "The AMA said it will launch a collection of educational resources and hold a series of roundtable discussions with doctors and experts to \"strengthen nutrition education and clinical competency.\" It also pledged to work with Congress to incentivize the consumption of nutrient-dense foods, expand food labeling efforts, define ultra-processed foods and increase investment in nutrition research.",

      "Jackson emphasized that his team remained \"deeply committed to Nick Reiner and to his best interests.\"",
      "Greene declined to answer questions from reporters who asked how Reiner intends to plead, saying they only spoke briefly in court. The public defender added that her office has not had contact with the Reiner family, and the family may not have been \"aware of what's going on.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the family said they \"have the utmost trust in the legal process and will not comment further on matters related to the legal proceedings.\"",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the prosecution would make sure Nick Reiner's defense gets what they need to represent him, and he is \"fully confident a jury will find Nick Reiner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the murder of his parents.\"",

      "A December arraignment was postponed after Reiner appeared in court wearing a suicide prevention smock and shackles. Jackson had said at the time, \"There are very, very complex and serious issues that are associated with this case,\" adding that those issues needed to be \"thoroughly but very carefully dealt with and examined and looked at and analyzed.\"",
      "Since the deaths of the couple, details have emerged about Nick Reiner's struggles with addiction. In 2018, he shared stories on a podcast about how his drug use while traveling cross-country landed him in a hospital, and another about punching walls and destroying a TV after his parents told him he had to leave their guesthouse.",
      "CBS News obtained police records for service calls at the Reiners' Los Angeles home from August 2013 through December. Over those 12 years, the LAPD responded to the address a total of seven times, including twice on the day the Reiners were found dead.",
      "In 2019, police responded once for a welfare check and again for a mental health call for a male. Records did not indicate who the officers made contact with. The remaining three calls were related to minor disturbances in 2013, 2014 and 2017.",
      "The bodies of the Reiners were found in their home on the afternoon of Dec. 14. Several hours later, Nick Reiner was arrested\u00a0outside a gas station convenience store in South L.A. He did not resist arrest, according to police.",

      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers linked to Venezuela \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean Sea, officials said.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure\u00a0of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.",
      "Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Night Stalkers.\"",
      "The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month.",
      "U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was \"conducting illicit activities\" and operating in international waters.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. \"for final disposition,\" according to U.S. Southern Command.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as \"back-to-back\" and \"meticulously coordinated,\" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.",
      "The Marinera, formerly Bella-1",
      "The Marinera \u2014 which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department \u2014 was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading.",
      "A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Noem said the tanker \"has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. \"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" she said.",
      "Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been \"granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,\" \"In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" the ministry said.",
      "The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping\u00a0lists\u00a0the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "Maduro has rejected U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and accuses the U.S. of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration plans to halt billions of dollars in federal funding for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud, a Department of Health and Human Services official said Tuesday.",
      "The move will freeze $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care Development Fund and roughly $870 million for social services grants that largely benefit children. The states affected are Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "The New York Post was first to report that HHS would withhold the funding.",
      "\"The best way to help poor families is to end the fraud so that the money that is available for them. And that's what we're doing,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes.",
      "\"The states that are affected are not affected because they're Democratic. They're affected because they refuse to cooperate with developing plans that would end the fraud. We gave them a warning. We said, show us your plan for ending the fraud and we won't cut it off. But if you won't show us a plan, a workable plan, we're going to cut it off until you do.\"",
      "Kennedy said how long the aid is frozen is up to the five states.",
      "\"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,\" Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.\"",
      "The Illinois Department of Human Services said it has not yet received any notification or communication about impacts to its federal funding.",
      "\"This is yet another politically-motivated action by the Trump Administration that confuses families and leaves states with more questions than answers. IDHS will provide an update if it is made aware of program or funding changes,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration comes after HHS announced last week that it froze federal child care funding for Minnesota because of \"blatant fraud\" in public-assistance programs.",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered \"large-scale fraud\" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",
      "CBS News visited several of the centers named by Shirley and found that all but two of the facilities have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "President Trump has criticized Minnesota leaders for its handling of the scandal and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked California, led by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, as \"more corrupt\" than Minnesota. He said Tuesday in a Truth Social post that \"the fraud investigation of California has begun.\" The president has not provided evidence of wide-scale fraud in California social services and did not provide further details about a probe involving the state.",
      "Beyond Minnesota, the Trump administration has also not put forth evidence of sweeping fraud schemes in social services in New York, Illinois and Colorado.",
      "Still, over the past several months the Trump administration has turned off the spigot of funding to Democrat-led states and cities, particularly during the historic government shutdown last year. Mr. Trump paused billions of dollars for infrastructure and climate projects, and slashed disaster preparedness grants.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed there is \"no scientific evidence\" the flu vaccine prevents hospitalizations or death in children, despite previous CDC guidance.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 It may be a \"better thing\" if fewer children receive the flu vaccine, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told CBS News, after the Trump administration announced sweeping changes to childhood vaccine recommendations.",
      "This week, the Centers for Disease Control\u00a0announced vaccines to fight respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease,\u00a0flu, and COVID are now recommended only for children at high risk of serious illness or after consultation between doctors and parents, as a part of the CDC's scaling back of key childhood vaccination recommendations. Until recently, the CDC recommended that everyone 6 months and older get the annual flu vaccine.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy.",
      "\"You have to, yeah, you need to do shared decision making with your physician, which is how it ought to be,\" Kennedy said.",
      "\"So fewer people will get the flu vaccine?\" Cordes asked.",
      "\"Well, that may be, and maybe that's a better thing,\" Kennedy said.",
      "\"Based on what evidence?\" Cordes pressed. \"There are 280, 290 kids who died last year due to the flu. There's no evidence that any kids died or were harmed due to the  flu vaccine. So isn't this inevitably going to lead to more children dying?\"",
      "Kennedy said the Cochrane Collaboration, a U.K.-based health care research nonprofit that he called \"one of the ultimate arbiters of vaccine safety and clinical data,\" has done an extensive meta-review of the flu vaccine. Kennedy said they found \"there is no evidence that the flu vaccine prevents serious disease or that it prevents hospitalizations or death in children.\"",
      "But that isn't regarded by the medical community as the only authority on vaccines, and the CDC as recently as last year\u00a0touted other studies\u00a0that found the flu vaccine significantly reduced a child's risk of dying from the flu and reduced the risk of an intensive care hospital stay.",
      "Cordes noted that roughly 90% of kids who died from the flu in 2024 weren't vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data.",
      "\"There is no scientific evidence that the flu vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalizations, or death in children,\" Kennedy responded.",

    "summary": "President Trump said \"people live in homes, not corporations,\" in announcing plans to bar big investors from home purchases.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, claiming the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and that action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House declined to provide more information on Mr. Trump's plans for restricting large investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the Trump administration has \"tremendous leverage\" over Venezuela because of the U.S. \"quarantine\" of sanctioned oil, and said the U.S. will control how money from sales of Venezuelan oil is disbursed.",
      "Rubio told reporters after briefing senators on the administration's involvement in Venezuela that the U.S. has a \"three-fold process\" that involves stabilization of the country, recovery and transition following the ouster of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We don't want it descending into chaos,\" he said.",
      "Rubio said the Trump administration's \"quarantine\" of sanctioned Venezuelan oil gives the U.S. the \"strongest leverage possible.\" He said the Trump administration is going to first be taking between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold \"at market rates.\" Crude oil prices have hovered around $60 a barrel in recent days.",
      "\"That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime, so we have a lot of leverage to move on the stabilization front,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the barrels will arrive in the U.S. \"very soon.\"",
      "\"The United States government has already begun marketing Venezuelan crude oil in the global marketplace for the benefit of the United States, engaged the world's leading commodity marketers, key banks to execute and provide financial support for these crude oil and crude product sales,\" she said.",
      "Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state oil company, confirmed that it is in negotiations with the U.S. for the sale of oil \"within the framework of the existing trade relations between the two countries.\"",
      "\"This process is being carried out under similar schemes to those in place with international companies, such as Chevron, and is based on a strictly commercial transaction, with criteria of legality, transparency, and benefit for both parties,\" the firm said in a statement. \"PDVSA reaffirms its commitment to continue building alliances that promote national development for the benefit of the Venezuelan people and that contribute to global energy stability.\"",
      "The second phase of the administration's plan, recovery, involves ensuring American, Western and other companies have access to the Venezuelan market \"in a way that's fair,\" as well as national reconciliation and amnesty for opposition forces, Rubio said. The third phase will then be transition, though the secretary of state did not provide details as to what they may entail.",
      "\"We feel like we're moving forward here in a very positive way,\" Rubio said.",
      "He said U.S. sanctions on Venezuela oil provide \"tremendous leverage,\" as the South American country's interim leaders \"cannot move any oil\" unless allowed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"There is a process now in place where we have tremendous control and leverage over what those interim authorities are doing and are able to do,\" he said. \"Obviously this will be a process of transition. In the end, it will be up to the Venezuelan people to transform their country.\"",
      "Senior administration officials, including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have been dispatched to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers about its plans for Venezuela after Maduro was deposed in an overnight operation\u00a0early Saturday.",

      "Mr. Trump said in announcing Maduro's ouster that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, but did not provide details as to the extent of a U.S. commitment. Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice president under Maduro, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the deal for 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil Tuesday night and said it would be controlled \"by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\"",
      "He said Energy Secretary Chris Wright would organize the process of transferring the oil from Venezuela to the U.S. Wright said earlier Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuelan oil sales \"indefinitely.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and the second in the Caribbean Sea \u2014 that are linked to Venezuela. With the latest seizures, the U.S. has now detained four tankers tied to the country.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-airlines-pilot-jet-panel-blew-out-sues-boeing/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 18:55:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Aldrich Ames was a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Aldrich Ames, a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia, has died, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson.",
      "Ames, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died Monday at the age of 84 at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland.",
      "The 31-year veteran of the CIA is believed to have compromised more than 100 intelligence operations and sent a number of Soviet agents to their deaths or prison, as he traded information for large sums of money that funded his lavish lifestyle.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ames admitted that he compromised \"virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me\" as well as giving the Soviet Union and Russia a \"huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies.\" Ames divulged the identities of 10 agents, and at least nine of them were executed, according to the Defense Department.",
      "There were a number of red flags throughout Ames' career \u2014 lie detector tests that showed deceptive answers, sudden unexplained wealth, poor job performance, alcohol abuse \u2014 but the CIA repeatedly missed or ignored the warning signs and promoted him to increasingly sensitive posts.",
      "Born in River Falls, Wisconsin, in 1941, Ames spent part of his childhood in Southeast Asia while his father worked for the CIA.",
      "After graduating high school and failing out of classes at the University of Chicago, Ames joined the CIA in 1962, performing clerical duties. At the same time, he attended George Washington University, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history.",
      "In 1969, he married his first wife, who also worked for the CIA, and accepted his first assignment abroad in Ankara, Turkey, where he targeted Soviet spies for recruitment. But he was sent back to CIA headquarters in Virginia after three years when his job performance declined.",
      "Back in the U.S., Ames' problems with alcohol began to surface at work and his marriage fell apart.",
      "Ames went alone to his assignment in Mexico City, where he worked from 1981 to 1983. There, he met his next wife, Rosario, a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Colombian Embassy and a CIA asset, who would later be charged as his accomplice.",
      "Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase on a train in New York that contained classified materials that could have compromised a Soviet asset, and his superiors' concerns about his heavy drinking, Ames was promoted to chief of the Soviet branch of the counterintelligence division.",
      "By then, financial pressure was building on Ames. The divorce from his first wife had left him in debt and he had new bills to pay once Rosario came to live with him.",
      "So, in 1985, he approached the Soviets, giving them the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. He later gave the KGB a list of CIA assets, dealing \"a crippling blow\" to the agency's Soviet operations, according to a 1994 Senate Intelligence Committee report. The KGB promised to give him more than $2 million for his cooperation. To tamp down suspicions about his newfound wealth, he told colleagues that Rosario came from a wealthy family.",
      "He continued spying for nine more years, including in Rome, where he served from 1986 to 1989. From 1990 to 1994, he oversaw operations in Western Europe and Czechoslovakia and worked for the CIA's counternarcotics center, traveling to meet his handlers in Vienna, Bogota and Caracas.",
      "Meanwhile, the CIA and FBI were looking for the source of the damaging compromises. In 1993, the mole hunt closed in on Ames. Investigators surveilled him for months, arresting him on Feb. 21, 1994, in Arlington, Virginia, days before he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow.",
      "Nearly two months later, Ames and his wife pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their espionage activities. Ames' wife was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "Then-CIA Director R. James Woolsey\u00a0said Ames was \"a malignant betrayer of his country who killed a number of people who helped the United States and the West win the Cold War.\" Those agents died, Woolsey said, because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar.\"",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0New York Times after his arrest, Ames explained his decision to start spying for the other side, saying money was the main motivator. But he also said the seed was planted when he regularly had lunch with a correspondent of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in the 1970s. The Soviet threat was not as great as the U.S made it out to be, he determined.",
      "\"I know what's damaging and I know what's not damaging, and I know what the Soviet Union is really all about, and I know what's best for foreign policy and national security,\" he told the New York Times. \"And I'm going to act on that.\"",

    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's leaders faced another day of intense protests on Wednesday, with the death toll climbing close to 40 according to a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists. As violent demonstrations popped up in more cities and towns across the Islamic Republic, the regime took a familiar stance, leaning into anti-Western rhetoric, ignoring the reports of dozens of civilians being killed, and offering economic aid to residents in a bid to quell the unrest that started as protests over inflation and the cost of living.",
      "As they grapple for ways to end the street protests \u2014 under the threat of U.S. intervention by President Trump \u2014 Iranian authorities said a man was executed by hanging after being convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, according to the country's state-run IRNA news agency.",
      "Ali Ardestani was convicted of providing Israeli intelligence \"with images and photos of specific locations and information on target subjects, and received amounts in the form of digital currency at the end of each mission,\" IRNA said. Iranian authorities hold trials behind closed doors, and no evidence against Ardestani was made public. Iran executed more than 1,000 people last year\u2014 the highest number of executions in the country since 1989, according to Amnesty International.",
      "The latest execution came as Iran's hardline Islamic rulers face the most significant domestic unrest seen in the country in several years. Nationwide protests against the autocratic regime entered their 12th day on Thursday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), set up by Iranian human rights activists and reliant on a network of contacts still in the country, said Wednesday that at least 38 people had been killed since the protests began, including four security forces.",
      "The protests started as business owners in Tehran vented frustration over spiraling inflation and the cost of basic goods. Iran's economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years, but the demonstrations escalated quickly into the widest protests seen in the country since 2022, following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for an alleged dress code violation.",
      "Trump's warning lingers as Iran tries to quell protests",
      "On Sunday, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. could hit Iran \"very hard\" if protesters are not protected. \"We're watching it very closely,\" Mr. Trump said. He'd said two days earlier that if Iran \"violently kills protesters,\" the U.S. would \"come to their rescue.\"",
      "So far, there's been no overt sign of the U.S. following through on these threats, even as the reported death toll from the protests climbs, and no further comment from the White House about what actions by the Iranian regime might actually trigger a response.",
      "In an effort to quell the internal pressure, Iran's government announced economic measures over the weekend to help Iranian citizens make ends meet, and state media said Wednesday that President Mahsoud Pezeshkian had ordered security forces not to attack peaceful demonstrators.",
      "Iran offers food aid in a bid to calm the streets",
      "Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said the new assistance measures, among other things, would triple national subsidies for regular households to buy basic goods, according to the state-controlled Mehr News Agency.",
      "The primary benefit, expected to begin Wednesday, would effectively triple the amount Iranians are given by the government to buy basic food items, adding the equivalent of about $7 more per month on top of existing subsidies for food, based on current exchange rates.",
      "One Iranian told CBS News on Wednesday that the subsidy increase wouldn't be enough.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-war-powers-vote-trump-venezuela-maduro/",
    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:06:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The previous two measures fell short of GOP support needed for passage. The third vote comes days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is expected to take a third vote today on another war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to strike Venezuela as the U.S. leader continues to take unilateral action against the South American country.",
      "The vote, scheduled for late Thursday morning, comes days after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife in a nighttime raid that came not only as a surprise to the former president, but also to Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump had long teased land strikes against Venezuela amid a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats at sea that has killed more than 100 people. Mr. Trump has not ruled out additional military action. He has said that the U.S. will \"run\" the country for the time being and control its oil sales after Saturday's strikes on Venezuela, which were carried out as part of a daring operation to capture Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face charges.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, introduced his latest resolution in early December, after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "\"The indication from the administration [is] that this is not a few days or a few weeks, it's likely a few years of U.S. occupation and involvement in this country,\" Kaine said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"This is not an arrest warrant. This is far bigger than that.\"",
      "Without additional Republican support, the measure is expected to meet the same fate as the previous failed two efforts spearheaded by Kaine to restrict military action in the region.",
      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, held briefings for top lawmakers on Tuesday on last weekend's actions in the region. They held similar briefings for all members of Congress on Wednesday.",
      "Democrats left those briefings dissatisfied with the answers they received about what comes next.",
      "The boat strikes and Maduro's seizure and removal to the U.S. have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers, with some accusing the Trump administration of committing war crimes, lying about its intentions for regime change and leading the U.S. into a war without congressional authorization.",
      "\"I think bombing a capital and removing the head of state is by all definitions, war,\" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone Republican cosponsor of the resolution, said Tuesday.",
      "Members of the Trump administration, including the president, have muddied the legal arguments by claiming that the operation to capture Maduro was a \"law enforcement\" operation that didn't require sign-off from Congress. Mr. Trump and other officials also say the U.S. is now in charge of Venezuela.",
      "Many Republicans have defended the Trump administration's failure to seek approval from Congress, arguing the actions are well within the president's constitutional authority and limited in scope.",
      "\"This is not a regime change. This is demand for change of behavior by a regime,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said after Monday's classified briefing. \"We don't expect troops on the ground.\"",
      "Johnson added Wednesday, \"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. There's no dispute about that, of course, but we are not in a war in Venezuela.\"",
      "Boat strikes scrutinized",
      "In the weeks before Maduro's capture, Mr. Trump dialed up his pressure campaign, seizing two sanctioned tankers that were carrying oil from Venezuela. On Wednesday, the U.S. carried out operations to seize two more vessels linked to Venezuela.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has voted against the war powers resolutions, suggested that if the U.S. can seize a giant oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, it could also seize smaller boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "\"I would take note, if we can take a big ship like this, we may be able to take a few boats, too, without blowing them out of the water,\" he told reporters last month. \"But that's a decision they have to make on the ground, I guess, based on the threat level.\"",
      "Paul, who has been a fierce critic of the strikes and has decried the lack of due process, shared a letter he received from the U.S. Coast Guard that said dozens of suspected drug smuggling vessels interdicted by the military branch possessed no illegal drugs. In total, 212 interdictions occurred between Sept. 1, 2024, and Oct. 7, 2025, according to the letter. Of those, 41 boats had \"no illicit contraband on board when interdicted,\" according to the Coast Guard.",
      "The letter also provided details on interceptions in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"Of the 212 total vessels interdicted during this period, 69 vessels were interdicted in the Caribbean Sea by Coast Guard surface assets, operating under Coast Guard law enforcement authority,\" the letter continued. \"Of these 69 interdictions, 14 had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted; 11 of those 14 vessels without contraband did not appear to commit any federal criminal offense. Of the 69 Caribbean interdictions, 14 vessels were indicted off the coast of Venezuela. Three of the 14 vessels interdicted near Venezuela had no illicit contraband on board when interdicted, but one of the three violated other U.S. federal criminal statutes.\"",
      "To justify the strikes, the Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. Lawmakers critical of the military action argue the rationale in the opinion is inadequate for the situation and have demanded that it be made public.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" perhaps seeking to bolster the justification for military action around Venezuela.",
      "Fentanyl was not mentioned in the indictment against Maduro.",
      "Grace  Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                                  Ibrahim  Aksoy\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Mr. Trump said on Truth Social he \"appreciated [Petro's] call and tone,\" adding that the two leaders are planning to meet at the White House at some point. The U.S. president said Petro called \"to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had.\"",

      "Petro said in a post on X that he and Mr. Trump discussed their disagreements over \"his vision of the relationship between the United States and Latin America.\" He said he believes the United States can partner with the region on energy, fueled by billions in U.S. investments, but the U.S. shouldn't use the region exclusively for oil.",
      "Petro included an image of a jaguar and a bald eagle embracing. The Colombian leader has repeatedly warned in recent months that U.S. strikes on Colombia would \"awaken the jaguar.\"",

      "Petro, meanwhile, has been a staunch critic of the U.S.'s military buildup near Latin America. He denounced the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug boats in a September speech before the United Nations, and days later, he said during a New York protest rally that members of the U.S. military should \"disobey the orders of Trump.\" The State Department revoked Petro's visa in response, calling his actions \"reckless and incendiary.\"",

      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers linked to Venezuela \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean Sea, officials said.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure\u00a0of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.",
      "Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Night Stalkers.\"",
      "The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month.",
      "U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was \"conducting illicit activities\" and operating in international waters.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. \"for final disposition,\" according to U.S. Southern Command.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as \"back-to-back\" and \"meticulously coordinated,\" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.",
      "The Marinera, formerly Bella-1",
      "The Marinera \u2014 which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department \u2014 was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading.",
      "A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Noem said the tanker \"has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. \"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" she said.",
      "Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been \"granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,\" \"In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" the ministry said.",
      "The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping\u00a0lists\u00a0the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",

      "Either way, that mix of perceptions is partly because most Americans say the administration hasn't clearly explained the U.S.' plans with Venezuela.",
      "Looking ahead, the public expresses uncertainty about what happens now with the U.S. military and Venezuela. Those who think U.S. military involvement will be limited are more approving of the action than those who now foresee a lot of involvement.",
      "And the majority do not want to see the U.S. having a lot of control over Venezuela.",
      "MAGA's views on Venezuela operation",
      "Even more MAGA Republicans support the action now than supported the idea of it back in November.",
      "There are at least two reasons: one is that they overwhelmingly call the operation a military success, whereas other Americans frequently say it's too soon to evaluate.",
      "Another is that they see more impact: MAGA Republicans are especially apt to say this will stop drugs, make the U.S. position in the world stronger, and get other countries in the region to cooperate with the U.S.",
      "Other Americans, by contrast, are more mixed on those implications.",
      "For context, MAGA Republicans also overwhelmingly approved of the U.S. bombing in Iran last summer.",
      "Impact of Maduro's removal from power on U.S. standing",
      "U.S. military and involvement from here",
      "On balance, many more call the specific operation that removed Maduro a success than not, but nearly half feel it is too soon to say. That may depend on what they think happens from here.",
      "Very few want the U.S. to have a lot of control over Venezuela now.",
      "Most do not support further military action if Venezuela does not cooperate with U.S. interests. Nor would they back taking military action in other countries in the region if those countries are not seen as cooperating with the U.S.",
      "But Republicans stand apart here \u2014 particularly most of the MAGA base: Most would support further military actions in either of those cases.",
      "In the region",
      "President Trump",
      "Somewhat more people approve of the military action to remove Maduro than approve of the president's handling of the situation with Venezuela more generally; the latter tracks more closely to his overall approval, and his overall approval hasn't changed since before this action.",
      "While they still don't give it wide approval, some groups do rate Maduro's removal a little more highly compared to how they rate the president's job performance overall. Hispanics are divided about the action to remove Maduro in the same split as Americans overall. Slightly more independents approve of removing Maduro than approve of Trump overall.",
      "Congress' role",
      "Looking at the role of Congress: just as before the action, when most Americans said Mr. Trump needed congressional approval for military action in Venezuela, so today do most Americans think Congress would need to approve any further military action there.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,325 U.S. adults interviewed between January 5-7, 2026. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:57:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Denmark and Greenland requested a meeting with Marco Rubio, which one Danish lawmaker hopes will halt talk \"about wanting to acquire Greenland.\"",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would meet with Danish officials next week, after the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark requested to confer \"as soon as possible,\" lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Brask said he was\u00a0\"guessing that it will be a matter of putting facts right, and stop the misinformation and stop talking about wanting to acquire Greenland.\u00a0Greenland is not for sale.\"",
      "The request comes after Rubio told U.S. lawmakers Monday that the Trump administration's goal was to buy the island, not take it by force, according to a lawmaker and a source familiar with his congressional briefing.",
      "The Trump administration has not, however, taken the option of using the U.S. military off the table to meet its stated objective of \"acquiring Greenland,\" as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put it on Tuesday.",
      "\"You can't buy another country or a population. You can't buy people, of course. And when we see the different images from United States of the president, for example, laughing when he's talking about Greenland \u2026 this is really something that is pissing people off in Greenland, to be honest and to be quite frank,\" Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark's Parliament, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"If you want to collaborate with us and with the Greenlanders, you need to respect us first and foremost.\"",
      "Chemnitz said the U.S. was using \"completely wrong tactics\" to engage with Greenland and called it \"appalling\" that the White House was \"not ruling out that annexation of our country is on the table.\"",
      "Both politicians emphasized that Greenland has always communicated to the U.S. that it is \"open for business,\" as far as American commercial interests in the region.",
      "\"Business development is something that Greenland is responsible for ourselves, and, therefore, it's something that we could do today if we wanted to,\" Chemnitz told CBS News.",
      "\"You can explore, of course, if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis,\" said Brask. \"There won't be any hold back on that.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News that thus far U.S. companies have been dissuaded from investing in Greenland's minerals because of the belief that the costs of mining forays on the vast, largely frozen island would outweigh the potential profits.",
      "\"With few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said.",
      "The U.S. seeking control of Greenland, \"to get the strategic minerals is also a bit strange, given that nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",
      "As for U.S. defense interests in Greenland, which President Trump has always stressed as a primary driver of his desire to control the island, Brask told CBS News there have been few hurdles to deepening such ties in the past, and very few at present.",
      "\"You put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc., just by asking, you can,\" he said, referring to the United States. \"It's not you running the country, but you have the options, the possibility of having troops, material \u2026 equipment in Greenland, you just have to ask.\"",
      "The U.S. has maintained one military base in Greenland, the Pituffik Space Base, which supports important missile warning and defense systems, and is the site of radar and satellite surveillance systems.",
      "\"Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland, and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold war ended. So in a sense, I think it's just worth keeping that in mind when Donald Trump is out saying Denmark is a bad ally and everything,\" Olesen told CBS News. \"It's tasks that the U.S. used to be happy to handle itself. That's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",

      "The Kentucky senator, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has long opposed offensive U.S. military action overseas. He voted to advance a war powers resolution, which would have limited the president's authority to continue a military campaign in Venezuela, but Senate Republicans blocked the measure. The Trump administration did not seek congressional approval before launching last week's strikes. The Senate is expected to bring up a war powers resolution again this week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of President Trump's interest in Greenland that he and his team are \"discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal.\"",

But you didn't get to those purchases like any deal or diplomacy by insulting your opponent. You get there by actually trying to please and get your opponent to agree to this, because it would have to be done voluntarily.\"",
      "Paul said that this type of action in Greenland would have to be initiated by a vote from its more than 50,000 citizens declaring their independence from Denmark, adding, \"I think the people of Greenland are inclined to do\" this.",
      "That would also have to be followed by \"some sort of offer of something that makes it better to be a part of the United States,\" he continued.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the strikes in Venezuela, Paul suggested it marked the beginning of the \"Don-roe doctrine,\" leading to questions about expansion extending to other territories, including Greenland and Canada.",

    "summary": "At least 36 people have reportedly been killed in Iran amid anti-government protests across the nation, putting its rulers under pressure as Trump threatens to intervene.",
    "story": [
      "At least 36 people have been killed amid major anti-government demonstrations across Iran, a U.S.-based rights group says. The Iranian government is trying to quell the unrest, and reacted angrily to President Trump's veiled threat of a U.S. armed intervention.",
      "The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which gave the death toll based on its network of contacts in the country, said in its daily report on Tuesday that at least 36 people \"have been confirmed killed during the past ten days of protests. Among them were four individuals under the age of 18, as well as two members of security and law enforcement forces.\"",
      "HRANA said more than 2,000 protesters had been arrested, \"however, the actual number of detainees is estimated to be significantly higher.\"",
      "The organization shared video on Tuesday that it said showed clashes between protesters and security forces at Tehran's Grand Bazaar \u2014 a center of commerce in the capital where shop owners have long backed the regime.",
      "The protests began more than a week ago in Tehran as business owners took to the streets to vent their frustration over soaring inflation in the nation, whose economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years. But the anger spread quickly to more than 250 locations in at least 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the Washington-based HRANA, with social media videos showing violent clashes between protesters chanting anti-government slogans and security forces every night since.",
      "People who spoke with CBS News from inside the country on Tuesday said the latest demonstrations in the capital were relatively small, corroborating other reports that efforts by the Iranian authorities to placate the protesters have likely had some effect in reducing numbers in recent days.",
      "President Trump said Friday \u2014 a day before American forces attacked Venezuela and captured the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro \u2014 that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded and ready,\" warning that if Iran \"violently kills protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't offered any further detail on his threat, but he's been ratcheting up pressure on Tehran since taking office for his second term, including with unprecedented U.S. strikes on the country's nuclear facilities in June as Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent Iranian news website IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday, referring to Mr. Trump's remarks. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "Iranian officials have not confirmed the deaths of any protesters, and while acknowledging the demonstrations and economic pain felt in the country, they make little mention of the violence seen on the streets and accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest. The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "The U.S. State Department has issued statements condemning specific incidents in Iran since Mr. Trump leveled his ambiguous threat, but the chances of an American intervention remained unclear on Tuesday.",
      "As has long been the case with Iran, the uncertainty left space for rumors to swirl. There were unconfirmed reports that the country's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was considering escaping into exile in Russia if the protests escalated out of control.",
      "Other reports have speculated that the government could even launch a new attack on Israel \u2014 something the regime has said it is ready for since the 12-day war in June \u2014 in a bid to divert attention away from domestic problems and refocus the population's anger at Iran's biggest foreign adversary, which would likely respond quickly and harshly.",
      "But Iran's intelligence services have a history of leaking false information to the media, especially foreign outlets, to create an exaggerated narrative that the country's leaders can then deny and portray as deliberate Western disinformation.",
      "In the meantime, the government has tried to quash the unrest on the streets not only with security forces, but with a series of measures aimed at showing sympathy with the protesters, including freezing some commodity prices and taxes on businesses, and even a dramatic move Monday to announce cash subsidies for essential goods for all households.",
      "The government does appear to have been bracing for unrest in the wake of the summer war with Israel, which constrained its sanctions-squeezed budgets even further and forced slashes to subsidies and social services.",
      "So far, however, even if the protests haven't continued escalating \u2014   which is difficult to gauge as Iran's government tightly controls the flow of information inside the country \u2014   the efforts to quell the unrest haven't fully succeeded.",
      "In the meantime, the demonstrations continue, as people wait for any further signals from Mr. Trump that he might be willing to try to take advantage of a vulnerable moment for the Islamic Republic's rulers.",

      "As former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife face drug trafficking and other federal charges in the U.S., virtually all of the ousted leader's inner circle \u2014 including some with whom he's accused of running a cartel that allegedly smuggled tons of cocaine into the U.S. \u2014 remain in their posts.",
      "A source briefed on the Trump administration's planning has told U.S. lawmakers that at least some members of that inner circle who, like Maduro, have been charged with crimes in the U.S., could be targets for further American military and law enforcement action.",
      "Secretary of State\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0said on CBS' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that an operation to capture at least four of Venezuela's top officials in separate locations was deemed too complicated ahead of the U.S. strikes on the country, leading to the operation focused solely on Maduro as the top target, along with his wife.",
      "Below is a look at some of the senior members of the Maduro regime who remain in Caracas, in some cases with U.S. bounties on their heads.",
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez",
      "The most senior member of Maduro's inner circle untouched by the U.S. attacks and raid over the weekend is the country's former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was sworn in soon after the American raid as the new interim president, taking the reins from her longtime political mentor.",
      "The 56-year-old has long been seen as a loyal confidant and protege of the now-deposed Venezuelan leader, and a member of a cadre accused by Washington for many years of helping Maduro maintain his authoritarian grip on power.",
      "It remains unclear if Rodr\u00edguez and the Trump administration might find a way to work together, and thus whether she might remain in power to some degree following Mr. Trump's assertion that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela for some unspecified period.",
      "Mr. Trump warned after Maduro's capture that if Rodr\u00edguez \"doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"",
      "Diosdado Cabello",
      "Another stalwart of the Maduro regime is Diosdado Cabello, who currently serves as Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, giving him oversight of the country's police and prisons.",
      "Cabello previously served as vice president, and for many years as president of the country's parliament. He also spent years in command of Venezuelan intelligence services.",
      "Like Maduro, he has been indicted on criminal charges in the United States, accused of helping to traffic more than 5 tons of cocaine to the U.S.",
      "He was first charged in 2020 with various federal drugs and weapons offenses in an indictment filed in the same Southern District of New York where Maduro was arraigned. The indictment named Cabello as a senior figure in the Cartel del los Soles, which Maduro is accused of leading.",
      "He was hit with further charges in a superceding indictment filed as the U.S. launched the attack on Venezuela. He's been described as the \"chief thug\" in terms of running Venezuela's domestic security forces, who helped keep Maduro in power, and the indictment lays out his alleged ties to drug cartels.",
      "Cabello could be among the targets of further U.S. military and law enforcement action, the source told CBS News' Brennan on Wednesday.",
      "There is a U.S. government reward of $25 million on offer for information leading to Cabello's capture.",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, currently serving as Venezuela's Minister of Defense, is also accused of direct involvement in trafficking drugs into the U.S.",
      "The U.S. accuses him of allowing the safe passage of commercial flights carrying illegal drugs, and of collecting a protection fee for doing so, and he was indicted in a federal court in Washington D.C. in 2020.",
      "Padrino, who has longstanding ties with Russia, also has a U.S. bounty on his head, with a $15 million reward on offer.",
      "Jorge Rodr\u00edguez",
      "The new interim president's brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, has served as President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, the country's Maduro-controlled legislature, since 2021. He's also considered a key figure in the regime.",
      "\"My main function in the days to come... as president of this National Assembly, will be to resort to all procedures, all platforms, and all avenues to bring back Nicolas Maduro Moros, my brother, my president,\" Jorge Rodriguez told lawmakers.",
      "Just like his sister, Rodr\u00edguez has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury over his alleged role in undermining democracy in Venezuela and propping up Maduro's authoritarian regime.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 06:24:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The funeral for Brigitte Bardot was private, but hundreds poured into the streets of Saint-Tropez to pay their respects to an icon of the 1960s silver screen.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 Brigitte Bardot's funeral was being held on Wednesday with a private service and a public homage in Saint-Tropez, the French Riviera resort where she lived for more than half a century after retiring from movie stardom at the height of her fame.",
      "The animal rights activist and far-right supporter died on Dec. 28 at the age of 91 at her home in southern France.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron said after her death that France was \"mourning a legend.\"",
      "She died from cancer after undergoing two operations, her husband, Bernard d'Ormale, said in an interview with Paris Match magazine released Tuesday evening. \"She was conscious and concerned about the fate of animals until the very end,\" he said.",
      "Residents and admirers applauded the funeral convoy as the coffin of Bardot, once one of the world's most photographed women and a defining screen siren of the 1960s, was being carried through the town's narrow streets.",
      "A service started to the sound of Maria Callas' \"Ave Maria\" at the Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption Catholic Church in the presence of Bardot's husband, son and grandchildren, as well as guests invited by the family and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered in the small town to follow the farewell on large screens set up at the port and on two plazas.",
      "After the church service, Bardot is to be buried \"in the strictest privacy\" at a cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Saint-Tropez town hall.",
      "She had long called Saint-Tropez her refuge from the celebrity that once made her a household name.",
      "A public homage will take place at a nearby site for admirers of the woman whose image once symbolized France's postwar liberation and sensuality.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most dazzling ambassador,\" the town hall said last week. \"Through her presence, personality and aura, she marked the history of our town.\"",
      "Bardot settled decades ago in her seaside villa, La Madrague, and retired from filmmaking in 1973 at age 39, during an international career that spanned more than two dozen films.",
      "She later emerged as an animal rights activist, founding and sustaining a foundation devoted to the protection of animals.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest recognition.",
      "While she withdrew from the film industry, she remained a highly visible and often controversial public figure through decades of militant animal rights activism and links with far-right politics.",
      "She will be buried in the so-called marine cemetery, where her parents are also interred.",
      "The cemetery, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, is also the final resting place of several cultural figures, including filmmaker Roger Vadim, Bardot's first husband, who directed her breakout film \"And God Created Woman,\" a role that made her a worldwide star.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "Administration officials are discussing a \"range of options\" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

    "summary": "Greenland is 836,000 square miles of largely frozen ground northeast of Canada. So why does the White House say it \"should be part of the United States\"?",
    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",

    "summary": "Top Trump aide Stephen Miller says it's the \"formal position\" of the White House that Denmark's territory of Greenland \"should be part of the U.S.\"",
    "story": [
      "European leaders released a joint statement Tuesday, outlining the importance of Arctic security, but stressing that \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" hours after White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said it was \"the formal position of the U.S. government... that Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Miller also said, in an interview Monday with CNN, that \"the United States is the power of NATO. For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States.\"",
      "Greenland has been a semi-autonomous  territory of Denmark, and has been tied to the small European nation for 300 years, though it has its own elected government. The largest island in the world, it is located to the northeast of Canada and is about the size of  Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to  only around 60,000 people.",
      "Its  location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both  economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said in their joint statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. The United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally and through the defense agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951,\" the U.S. allies said.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.",
      "\"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told local media on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO, and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday if the U.S. would use military force to take over Greenland, Miller told CNN: \"The United States should have Greenland as part of the United States. There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking, of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers pushed back against the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steny H. Hoyer and Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, said in a joint statement that \"sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous.\"",
      "They said any U.S. attack on Greenland \"would tragically be an attack on NATO.\"",
      "\"We already have access to everything we could need from Greenland,\" the two lawmakers said, noting that Denmark's government has already given the U.S. permission to deploy additional military forces there, or to build more missile defense infrastructure on the island.",

      "Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.",
      "Cher is opening up about how her late ex-husband Sonny Bono controlled her during their marriage and musical partnership.",
      "On Monday's episode of \"Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\" the 79-year-old singer reflected on her turbulent personal and professional relationship with Bono, with whom she rose to fame in the 1960s as the pop duo Sonny & Cher.",
      "In 1962, the former couple first met in Los Angeles when Cher was 16 and Bono was a 27-year-old aspiring music producer. Bono, who was working with record producer Phil Spector at the time, became Cher\u2019s mentor, manager and creative partner. The two formed Sonny & Cher in 1964 and they tied the knot during an unofficial wedding ceremony in Tijuana, Mexico, later that year.",

      "\"We had a lot of fun, and he was special in a way, and then it became very treacherous,\" Cher recalled.",
      "Cher opened up about her troubled marriage to the late Sonny Bono. (Jeff Hochberg/Getty Images)",
      "In 1965, Sonny & Cher made their breakthrough with the success of their song \"I Got You, Babe,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The duo, who officially married in 1969, went on to release scores of other hits with Bono handling songwriting, production and business, while Cher was the breakout star and the duo's main draw.",
      "Their success later expanded into television when they launched the variety show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" which made them household names in the early 1970s.",
      "While appearing on \"Armchair Expert,\" Cher explained that her relationship with Bono began to unravel at the height of their fame as he began to increasingly control her day-to-day decisions.",
      "The former couple formed the iconic musical duo \"Sonny & Cher.\" (Harry Langdon/Getty Images)",
      "\"This is when now this kind of new side of Sonny comes out,\" Shepard said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Cher agreed with a nod.",
      "\"Which is like incredibly controlling,\" Shepard continued. \"You have this huge success. There's a lot of money. You're not allowed to leave the house. You're allowed to go shopping. That's pretty much all you're allowed to do, right?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Cher said.",
      "\"And he's cutting you off from friendships you have,\" Shepard said. \"Was it happening slowly? Was it more like you woke up one day and were like, 'Oh, I don't have a life' or while it was happening, were you like, 'What's going on?'\"",
      "\"It took a little while,\" Cher admitted. \"I couldn't do anything.\"",
      "Cher recounted how she began learning to play tennis and would practice at a friend's house. The \"Believe\" hitmaker recalled a harrowing incident that occurred after Bono discovered that she had been seen at her friend's home during a party after playing tennis.",
      "\"I'm leaving, but she's having a huge party. So there are people coming in,\" she recalled. \"And so Dennis, my friend, told Sonny that I was there, but lots of people were there and lots of men were there.\"",
      "\"And he burned my clothes,\" Cher said. \"In the yard.\"",
      "Cher described Bono's controlling behavior and recalled that he once burned her clothes in the yard during a fit of rage.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Cher explained that her realization of how Bono was exerting excessive power over her life \"came on kind of slowly.\" The Grammy Award winner said that part of her difficulty with fully grasping the situation stemmed from the difference between how Bono treated her on the set of \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" and his behavior at home.",
      "\"I was free on the show, and he was funny, and we got along,\" Cher remembered. \"It's such a strange dichotomy because we would be laughing, and we'd be having the best time and then when we were at home, it was kind of more cut and dried.\"",
      "CHER WAS 'SHOCKED' WHEN SHE DISCOVERED LEGAL NAME DECADES AFTER BIRTH CERTIFICATE ERROR",
      "Cher recalled that she also discovered that Bono was cheating on her during the rocky later years of their marriage. After Shepard remarked that Bono had \"lots of other girlfriends,\" Cher told him, \"I didn't know except the one.\"",
      "Shepard cited an incident that Cher wrote about in her 1998 memoir \"The First Time,\" in which she went to get a glass of water in the middle of the night and found another woman \"putting her boots on\" in the home the singer shared with Bono.",
      "Cher told Shepard that she had no thoughts of leaving Bono at the time despite the shocking incident. She explained that she stayed in the relationship largely due to \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\" However, she clarified that her reluctance to leave wasn't because she was driven to preserve the show's massive success.",
      "\"It wasn't that, because I was so happy with the show. And he was so nice on the show. And so, at the show we would be having the best time, and we were more working than we were at home,\" she said. \"It was such a polar opposite, because on stage we had a blast. He let me have all the freedom that I wanted to, and then we came home.\"",
      "\"The show kept us together a lot longer than we would have been anyway, because we had such a good time,\" she continued. \"He was so fun, and he was so funny, and we worked so well together.\"",
      "The two found success with their show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\"\u00a0 (CBS)",
      "However, Cher recalled that she grew increasingly unhappy with their marriage and her lack of autonomy amid the power imbalance. In February 1974, they decided to divorce, and their show was canceled two months later.",
      "CHER CELEBRATES 77TH BIRTHDAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTIONING AGE: \u2018WHEN WILL I FEEL OLD?\u2019",
      "Shepard recalled that Cher only learned how little control she had over the money that she and Bono had earned during the divorce proceeding after Cher's friend and music executive David Geffen asked to review her contract.",
      "\"It's not until Geffen looks at this contract and says to you, 'Do you realize 100% of this money goes to a company called Cher Inc. that is owned 95% by Sonny and 5% by his lawyer?'\"",
      "\"0% for Cher?\" Shepard's co-host Monica Padman asked in disbelief.",
      "\"0%,\" Shepard said.",
      "\"It was like born yesterday, because they would bring me a bunch of share enterprises contracts to sign and it was always like when I was getting ready to go on stage,\" Cher said.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you going to do \u2014 read 20 pages of legalese?\" Shepard said.",
      "\"And the next day, he said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get out of this,'\" Cher recalled of Geffen. \"So I went to Sonny and I said, 'I'll stay with you if we're partners. And he said no.'\"",
      "Sonny and Cher divorced in 1975.\u00a0 (Getty)",
      "Shepard pointed out that over their time working together, they made some \"serious, serious money.\"",
      "\"And you didn't walk with half of that is what you're saying?\" Shepard asked.",
      "\"I didn't walk with any of it,\" Cher said. \"None of it.\"",

      "The prescription opioid pill, called naltrexone, was first approved by the FDA to treat opioid dependence in 1984. A decade later, it was approved for alcohol use disorder. (iStock)",
      "\"Naltrexone can be used to assist with reducing alcohol cravings and reduce the pleasurable effects from alcohol ingestion, which can help those prone to binge-drinking to consume less volume,\" Dr. David Campbell, clinical director and program director at Recover Together, a behavioral health and addiction treatment facility in Bend, Oregon, told Fox News Digital.",
      "HIGHER STROKE RISK LINKED TO CONSUMING CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL, STUDY FINDS",
      "The medication is useful for people who experience strong cravings, often drink to excess once they start, or drink primarily due to reward or relief as opposed to habit, according to Campbell.",
      "\"Naltrexone affects the rewards center of the brain, which blocks the rewarding effects of alcohol.\"",
      "Jessica Steinman, chief clinical officer at No Matter What Recovery in Los Angeles, calls naltrexone \"an incredibly helpful and life-saving tool\" for people who struggle with alcohol use disorder.",
      "\"Currently, in our society, many people are looking to get medication-assisted help from overconsumption of certain things or behaviors, including food, cigarettes and now alcohol,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND FENTANYL VACCINE TARGETS OVERDOSES BEFORE THEY START",
      "\"Naltrexone affects the rewards center of the brain, which blocks the rewarding effects of alcohol and cravings to be minimized. It can assist in telling the brain that alcohol isn't wanted.\"",
      "The drug can also help if someone has a \"healthy\" relationship with alcohol and is looking to cut back on their drinking behaviors, Steinman added.",
      "\"We do not suggest moderation in any way for people struggling with alcohol use disorder or any type of dependence to alcohol or other substances,\" she noted. \"We do not believe drinking \u2018less\u2019 is a solution.\"",
      "Side effects",
      "Common side effects of naltrexone can include nausea and vomiting, headache, sleep disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, loss of appetite, and joint or muscle pain, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).",
      "These effects are generally mild and may improve as the body adjusts to the medication.",
      "The medication is useful for people who experience strong cravings, often drink to excess once they start, or drink primarily due to reward or relief as opposed to habit. (iStock)",
      "In rare cases, patients may experience more severe effects, such as liver issues, allergic reactions, trouble breathing and mental health effects.",
      "\"The most important thing when taking naltrexone for alcohol use is to ensure that there is no concurrent use of opioids, as taking naltrexone when using opioids can induce precipitated withdrawal, a very uncomfortable event,\" Campbell cautioned.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson has the latest on how a biotech company plans to test its vaccine that could protect people from fentanyl's lethal effects on 'Special Report.'",
      "A vaccine to protect against fentanyl\u2019s deadly effects is headed for clinical trials in humans.",
      "The vaccine, which showed positive results in studies of mice and rats, is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses.",

      "DEADLY DRUG MIX DRIVES STAGGERING RISE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AMONG SENIORS",
      "This is different than treatments like naloxone, which reverse the effects after an overdose.",
      "How it works",
      "The vaccine is designed to create antibodies against fentanyl, which keeps the drug from crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier.",
      "It contains a synthetic fragment of fentanyl attached to a protein called CRM197, along with dmLT, an immune-activating compound.",
      "The vaccine is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses. (iStock)",
      "This combination stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that capture fentanyl in the bloodstream before it can reach the brain, according to the University of Houston's Colin Haile, co-founder and scientific advisor of ARMR Sciences, which licensed the vaccine.",
      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain. They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, the fentanyl would be eliminated from the body.",
      "MAJOR CANNABIS STUDY FINDS LITTLE PROOF FOR POPULAR MEDICAL CLAIMS, FLAGS BIG DANGERS",
      "In the mice and rat studies, the animals still had antibodies against fentanyl six months after vaccination, added Haile, who is also a research associate professor of psychology at UH and a founding member of the UH Drug Discovery Institute.",
      "While some have questioned whether such a vaccine would indirectly encourage drug use, Haile pointed out that, for vaccinated people, the drug would have \"no euphoric effects.\" So, those seeking a \"high\" would not get it.",
      "Fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana. (iStock)",
      "The main benefit, according to Haile, is that the vaccine would reduce the potential health dangers of fentanyl.",
      "\"Respiratory depression is the primary effect that induces death from this highly potent synthetic opioid,\" he said.",
      "Headed for trials",
      "Following successful testing in mice and rats, the first human clinical trial is slated to begin in early 2026 at the Center for Human Drug Research, which is associated with the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.",
      "\"They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "The small Phase 1 trial will enroll about 40 participants, focusing on safety and immune response.",
      "After the Phase 1 trial for safety, a Phase 2 trial will test whether the vaccine effectively blocks fentanyl\u2019s effects in humans.",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "The primary limitation is that data so far is available only for mouse models, and it\u2019s unknown how effective the vaccine would be in humans.",
      "Haile told Fox News Digital there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"Also, unlike other vaccines, we use extremely low doses of the components,\" he noted. \"We have put the vaccine into a lot of animals and have not seen any adverse side effects at all.\"",

      "Potential use cases",
      "Haile mentioned several different use cases for the vaccine, primarily those with opioid use disorder who want to quit using fentanyl.",
      "It could also be used by first responders and healthcare workers who want to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Military and national security personnel could also benefit from the vaccine, Haile said, as it could help protect against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds that have been used as chemical threats.",
      "Finally, parents may be seeking protection for at-risk teens or young adults, as fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana.",
      "The progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside,\" a medical expert said. (iStock)",
      "Looking ahead, Haile said this could pave the way for the approval of other anti-drug vaccines, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which are already in the works.",
      "\"If we can tackle the primary ones \u2014 fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine \u2014 we will be saving hundreds of thousands of lives,\" he added.",

      "The funding penalty follows a \"final determination\" issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) after California missed a Jan. 5, 2026, deadline to cancel the licenses. Federal officials say this allowed foreign drivers whose licenses did not comply with federal lawful-presence requirements to continue operating heavy commercial vehicles on U.S. roads.",
      "\"It\u2019s reckoning day for [Gov.] Gavin Newsom and California. Our demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again,\" Duffy said in a statement.",
      "\"Gavin Newsom has failed to do so, putting the needs of illegal immigrants over the safety of the American people.\"",

      "Duffy added the administration is pulling the funding \"to ensure federal tax dollars don\u2019t fund this charade.\"",
      "According to the FMCSA, the agency\u2019s audit uncovered what it described as a \"systemic collapse\" of California\u2019s non-domiciled CDL program. Federal officials said the state illegally issued licenses with expiration dates extending years beyond a driver\u2019s lawful presence and granted CDLs to individuals who were ineligible to hold them under federal safety regulations.",
      "Overall, more than 20,000 active non-domiciled \u2014 people whose permanent home is located outside the U.S. \u2014 CDLs were issued by California in violation of federal rules, according to the audit.",

      "\"Federal regulations are clear: states must correct safety deficiencies on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the Agency, and California failed to meet its commitment to rescind these unlawfully-issued licenses by January 5,\" FMCSA Administrator Derek D. Barrs said. \"We will not accept a corrective plan that knowingly leaves thousands of drivers holding noncompliant licenses behind the wheel of 80,000-pound trucks in open defiance of federal safety regulations.\"",
      "Federal officials said a nationwide audit conducted in September found that more than 25% of California\u2019s non-domiciled CDLs were unlawfully issued, including licenses extended as many as four years beyond the expiration of lawful presence documentation.",

      "The audit cited one case in which California issued a CDL to a driver from Brazil with endorsements to operate a passenger bus and a school bus, even though the license remained valid for months after the driver\u2019s legal presence expired.",
      "In November, California agreed to revoke every illegally issued license within 60 days and to work with federal officials so the agency could verify that the failures allowing the licenses to be issued had been corrected, according to the release.",
      "Federal officials said the state failed to meet that commitment and attempted to extend the revocation deadline without federal approval.",

      "U.S. interest in Greenland also would likely counter China\u2019s growing Arctic ambitions and deny Beijing a foothold in the region. China published its first Arctic policy white paper in 2018, when it labeled itself a \"near-Arctic state,\" while promoting a \"Polar Silk Road\" as part of its broader Belt and Road vision. Trump first publicly mentioned interest in Greenland in 2019.",

      "\"It's just something we've talked about,\" Trump said in 2019. \"Denmark essentially owns it. We're very good allies with Denmark. We've protected Denmark like we protect large portions of the world, so the concept came up.",
      "\"Strategically, it's interesting. And we'd be interested. We'll talk to them a little bit,\" the president said. \"It's not No. 1 on the burner, I can tell you that.\"",
      "Greenland spans roughly 836,000 square miles, though most of the world's largest island is covered by an ice sheet. It\u2019s home to about 56,000 people, predominantly Inuit and Danes, with the capital and largest town, Nuuk, serving as the country\u2019s political and economic hub. The island is also home to oil, natural gas and mineral resources, which could be used to manufacture batteries and other technologies.",

      "Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new scientific breakthrough suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.",
      "Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage devices called supercapacitors. The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles.",
      "The research was published in Energy & Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.",

      "SCIENTISTS EXTRACT SILVER FROM E-WASTE USING COOKING OIL",
      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",
      "NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS",
      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A dangerous cybercrime tool has surfaced in underground forums, making it far easier for attackers to spread malware.",
      "Instead of relying on hidden downloads, this tool pushes fake error messages that pressure you into fixing problems that never existed. Security researchers say this method is spreading quickly because it feels legitimate. The page looks broken. The warning feels urgent. The fix sounds simple.",
      "That combination is proving alarmingly effective for cybercriminals.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",
      "FAKE WINDOWS UPDATE PUSHES MALWARE IN NEW CLICKFIX ATTACK",
      "Following the on-screen instructions can quietly trigger malware that steals passwords and personal data. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake error malware",
      "A few smart habits can significantly reduce risk when facing fake error pop-ups and browser-based traps.",
      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",
      "Real browser and operating system updates come from built-in update tools, not pop-ups on websites. If an update is needed, your device will notify you directly through system settings or trusted app stores.",
      "Strong antivirus software can help block malicious scripts, detect infostealers and stop suspicious behavior before damage spreads. This is especially important since fake error malware targets Windows, Android, macOS and Linux systems.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Stolen credentials fuel the spread of fake error malware. Removing personal information from data broker sites can reduce the impact if login details are compromised and limit how far an attack can spread.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Claims about missing fonts or outdated browsers are a hallmark of these attacks. Modern systems manage fonts automatically, and browsers update themselves. A webpage has no reason to request manual fixes.",
      "If a real update is needed, the operating system will request it directly. A random webpage never should.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine. Nothing about the moment screams danger. But behind the scenes, one click can quietly hand over passwords, banking access and personal data. The good news is that slowing down makes a real difference. Closing a suspicious page and trusting built-in system updates can stop these attacks cold. When it comes to pop-ups claiming your device is broken, walking away is often the smartest fix.",

      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked.

      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",

      "A long-running malware operation quietly abused trusted browser extensions across Chrome, Edge and Firefox, infecting millions worldwide. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. A data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.",
      "It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Subtle changes often appear before obvious damage. Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",

It unfolded slowly, over years, and relied on trust most people never think twice about. Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today.

      "Malicious Chrome extensions hiding in plain sight",
      "Researchers at Socket discovered two Chrome extensions using the same name, \"Phantom Shuttle,\" that were posing as tools for proxy routing and network speed testing (via Bleeping Computer). According to the researchers, the extensions have been active since at least 2017.",
      "Both extensions were published under the same developer name and marketed toward foreign trade workers who need to test internet connectivity from different regions. They were sold as subscription-based tools, with prices ranging from roughly $1.40 to $13.60.",
      "At a glance, everything looked normal. The descriptions matched the functionality. The pricing seemed reasonable. The problem was what the extensions were doing after installation.",
      "How Phantom Shuttle steals your data",
      "Socket researchers say Phantom Shuttle routes all your web traffic through proxy servers controlled by the attacker. Those proxies use hardcoded credentials embedded directly into the extension's code. To avoid detection, the malicious logic is hidden inside what appears to be a legitimate jQuery library.",
      "The attackers didn't just leave credentials sitting in plain text. The extensions hide them using a custom character-index encoding scheme. Once active, the extension listens to web traffic and intercepts HTTP authentication challenges on any site you visit.",
      "To make sure traffic always flows through their infrastructure, the extensions dynamically reconfigure Chrome's proxy settings using an auto-configuration script. This forces your browser to route requests exactly where the attacker wants them.",
      "In its default \"smarty\" mode, Phantom Shuttle routes traffic from more than 170 high-value domains through its proxy network. That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",
      "While acting as a man-in-the-middle, the extension can capture anything you submit through web forms. That includes usernames, passwords, card details, personal information, session cookies from HTTP headers and API tokens pulled directly from network requests.",
      "CyberGuy contacted Google about the extensions, and a spokesperson confirmed that both have been removed from the Chrome Web Store.",

      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",
      "OPINION: THE FAITH DEFICIT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN",
      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",
      "Mental health professionals say the timing of symptom escalation matters. When delusions intensify during prolonged chatbot use, AI interaction may represent a contributing risk factor rather than a coincidence.",
      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.",

      "Tips for using AI chatbots more safely",
      "Mental health experts stress that most people can interact with AI chatbots without problems. Still, a few practical habits may help reduce risk during emotionally intense conversations.",
      "Avoid treating AI chatbots as a replacement for professional mental health care or trusted human support.Take breaks if conversations begin to feel emotionally overwhelming or all-consuming.Be cautious if an AI response strongly reinforces beliefs that feel unrealistic or extreme.Limit late-night or sleep-deprived interactions, which can worsen emotional instability.Encourage open conversations with family members or caregivers if chatbot use becomes frequent or isolating.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",
      "Security fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",

      "What happened and how attackers got in",
      "According to the university, hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite. This application handles financial operations and contains highly sensitive data.",
      "Based on the technical details shared so far, security researchers believe the attack aligns with tactics used by the Clop ransomware gang. Clop has a long track record of stealing data through zero-day flaws rather than encrypting systems.",

If your information appears on the dark web or if someone tries to open a new account, you receive an alert right away. As a result, many services also help you quickly freeze bank and credit card accounts to limit further fraud.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Because this breach exposed names, contact details and other identifiers, reducing what is publicly available about you matters. A data removal service can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, which lowers the risk of targeted phishing or fraud tied to the stolen University of Phoenix records.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Expect more scam emails and phone calls. Criminals may reference the breach to sound legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "7) Secure your devices",
      "Keep your operating systems and apps up to date, as attackers often exploit outdated software to gain access. In addition, enable automatic updates and review app permissions to prevent stolen personal data from being combined with device-level access and causing further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The University of Phoenix data breach highlights a growing problem in higher education. When attackers exploit trusted enterprise software, the fallout spreads fast and wide. While free identity protection helps, long-term vigilance matters most. Staying alert can limit damage long after the headlines fade.",

      "There are also a few areas where friction may occur. If you use Sign in with Google on third-party websites, you may need to sign in again.

    "summary": "Mac malware campaign uses fake AI chat results to deliver AMOS through terminal commands, security researchers report. Attackers exploit trust in AI-generated cleanup guides.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Attackers rely on trust in search results and AI answers, knowing most people will not question step-by-step instructions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from fake AI chat malware",
      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 07:02:37 -0500",
    "summary": "States require AI disclosure in healthcare as California, Colorado and Utah implement laws mandating transparency when artificial intelligence influences patient care decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "STATE-LEVEL AI RULES SURVIVE \u2014 FOR NOW \u2014 AS SENATE SINKS MORATORIUM DESPITE WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE",
      "AI now supports many healthcare decisions, from patient communications to coverage reviews, making transparency more important than ever for trust and accountability. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",
      "AI TOOLS COULD WEAKEN DOCTORS' SKILLS IN DETECTING COLON CANCER, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",
      "According to analysis from Morgan Lewis, disclosure requirements most often apply when AI is used for:",
      "Patient-facing clinical communicationsUtilization review and utilization managementClaims processing and coverage decisionsMental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "Patient-facing clinical communications",
      "Utilization review and utilization management",
      "Claims processing and coverage decisions",
      "Mental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

Tim Walz saying he had seen a video of the shooting and warning people not to believe \u201cthe propaganda machine.\u201d",

      "While some conservatives have questioned Trump\u2019s endgame in Venezuela, MAGA loyalists and Trump allies who spoke to NBC News this week said that they support the president\u2019s actions in the region so far. And surveys show that, for now, the president\u2019s voters are sticking with him too. According to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, just 6% of Republicans oppose Trump\u2019s military action to remove Maduro, while 65% support a stronger U.S. role in Venezuela. And 10% of Republicans polled by The Washington Post disapprove of the operation, while 74% support it.",
      "Delta commandos moved into Caracas overnight Friday, and Maduro was turned over to U.S. authorities on drug-trafficking charges. Since then, Trump and the White House have framed the operation as part of restoring stability in the Western Hemisphere and reviving the Monroe Doctrine, a theme in Trump\u2019s 2025 national security strategy, which asserts that the U.S. has a right to be the dominant influencer in its part of the globe. On Saturday, the president referred to his plan for the U.S. to reassert itself in its backyard as the \u201cDonroe Doctrine.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor too long, American leaders have focused on faraway lands,\u201d said Alex Bruesewitz, a Trump campaign adviser. \u201cMAGA voters understand that a stronger Western Hemisphere will lead to a stronger and more prosperous America.\u201d",
      "The MAGA base is likely to stay in line with Trump on Venezuela, so long as the intervention is swift and doesn\u2019t involve a long-term occupation or result in substantial American casualties or investment, said a MAGA-aligned operative close to the White House who requested anonymity to speak candidly.",
      "Though analysts told NBC News in December that a land war could cause a rift between Trump and his MAGA base, this person added that the early days are more reminiscent of last summer\u2019s strikes in Iran \u2014 quick and largely forgotten after some initial handwringing.",
      "It helped, the operative said, that after Trump said at a Saturday news conference that the U.S. \u201cwould run\u201d Venezuela, the president clarified in an interview with the New York Post that he was not planning to put troops on the ground if Venezuela\u2019s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez cooperated.

      "Whether MAGA remains on board is uncertain. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. is not afraid of \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Venezuela has fueled concerns about escalation, a sentiment that intensified after he threatened, in a 20-minute span aboard Air Force One, Iran, Greenland, Colombia and Venezuela if \u201cthey don\u2019t behave,\u201d while adding that Cuba \u201cis ready to fall.\u201d",

      "\u201cRather than repeating the mistakes of past administrations, the president is reasserting and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere, control migration and stop drug trafficking,\u201d said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. \u201cThe president is never deterred by panicans \u2014 by delivering a 5% defense spending pledge from NATO allies, ending wasteful foreign assistance, negotiating fairer trade deals, securing major economic investments and more, he has successfully renewed American strength to bring deliverables home to our country.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has left little doubt about his plans for Venezuela\u2019s oil: He wants it and he\u2019s willing to do a lot to secure it, going as far as saying that the United States could reimburse oil companies for money they spend to rebuild the country\u2019s aging infrastructure and jump-start production.",
      "If only it were so simple.",
      "Tapping Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves will require a multiyear effort and billions of dollars of investment in an exceedingly complex geopolitical environment, experts and industry veterans said in interviews with NBC News.",
      "And while it remains unclear just how much control the U.S. will actually have in Venezuela \u2014 Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have offered a range of answers in recent days \u2014 experts say it\u2019s factors outside of anyone\u2019s control that make Venezuela a very dangerous place to drill for oil.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Wednesday that he is talking to all the corporate players \"that were in Venezuela, that are in Venezuela, that want to go into Venezuela.\u201d",
      "In those talks, Wright said, he is asking oil companies, \u201cWhat are the necessary conditions it would take you to put billions of dollars in to develop fields and build infrastructure?\u201d",
      "Wright did not say whether any companies had agreed to either re-enter the country or expand current operations there.",
      "On Friday, top executives from the three biggest American oil companies, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, are scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House, an administration official told NBC News on Wednesday. Wright is also expected to attend that meeting.",
      "A spokesperson for Conoco told NBC News Wednesday that the company is \u201cmonitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\u201d",
      "Exxon and Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In recent days, a Chevron spokesperson has told NBC News that the company \u201cremains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "A dangerous assignment",
      "\u201cThe problem here is insurgency, terrorism and guerillas,\u201d said Robert Pape, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and an expert in security affairs.",
      "\u201cThere is no way you\u2019re going to be able to send in the civilian contractors\u201d who make up the core workforce for international oil operations, he said.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has the jungles of Vietnam and the mountains of Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "In an interview Monday with NBC News, Trump predicted that American companies could get expanded oil operations in Venezuela \u201cup and running\u201d in fewer than 18 months. Most experts put the timeline for expanding operations at a minimum of three to five years.",
      "But any expansion of oil operations in Venezuela would put the workers on the ground in danger, regardless of how much political influence the U.S. has with the government in Caracas, said Douglas Farah, president of the national security consulting firm IBI Consultants.",
      "Pushing into new territory \u201cis the way you\u2019re going to run into all the different armed groups that are outside of the capital, and outside, probably, the control of Delcy Rodriguez or whoever else may be holding influence in the region,\u201d Farah said, referring to the interim president.",
      "Groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) and Colombia\u2019s FARC dissidents operate in the forested mountains that straddle Colombia and Venezuela.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re looking at groups that have had decades of combat experience and decades of extraction of natural resources,\u201d Farah said.",
      "In addition to a long tradition of unregulated gold mining in the Orinoco region of western Venezuela, guerilla groups have more recently begun mining rare earth minerals like coltan.",
      "Moreover, given the vast distances and the difficult terrain, oil infrastructure \u201cis going to be very difficult to secure without a significant number of U.S. troops on the ground,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said Monday that he would be willing to send U.S. forces into Venezuela if he felt Rodriguez and the remaining Maduro government \u201cwent against making Venezuela great again.\u201d",
      "Venezuelan officials have not responded directly to Trump\u2019s comments about oil since deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s capture, nor has the country\u2019s state-run oil company.",
      "Questionable returns",
      "Trump\u2019s fixation on Venezuela\u2019s oil and his potential willingness to deploy U.S. forces to secure it underscore how much petroleum remains a key cog in the international system.",
      "As Trump has scaled back on renewable energy investments and advocated a \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d movement to double down on oil and gas, the U.S. has leaned even harder into global petro-politics.",
      "Yet, even beyond the immediate danger to employees that going into Venezuela would present for U.S. oil companies, experts said, the economic incentives that a company would typically need in order to justify such a risk-laden investment are absent here.",
      "Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips have already lost billions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment and technology seized by the Venezuelan government in 2007.",
      "That year, the government of then-President Hugo Chavez decreed that foreign oil companies could own no more than a 40% stake in any oil project in the country, with the rest held by a state-run oil company.",
      "The only major U.S. firm to accept the terms was Chevron, which remains in Venezuela to this day.",
      "Exxon and ConocoPhillips are still trying to recover some of the money they lost.",
      "There\u2019s also the problem of the specific type of oil Venezuela\u2019s fields produce. Known as heavy, sour crude, the oil is thick like molasses and rich in sulphur.",
      "This combination is terrible for equipment and pipelines, said Matt Randolph, an internationally recognized expert in oil and gas.",
      "In Venezuela, \u201cthe oil is so corrosive, it eats metal,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why you need $100 billion in investments for infrastructure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause as it sat there, it has just rotted away.\u201d",
      "The specific qualities of Venezuelan crude could also have an upside, however.",
      "This type of oil is \u201cparticularly well-suited for U.S. Gulf Coast oil refineries,\" longtime industry analyst John Kilduff told NBC News.",
      "Trump himself has said his plan would require billions of dollars in investment up-front from the oil companies. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot of money,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cA tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\u201d",
      "But the promise of huge revenues is complicated by the reality of global oil prices.",
      "Last year, both U.S. crude oil and internationally sourced Brent crude oil posted their largest annual price drops since 2020.",
      "\u201cOil prices have to be significantly higher than they are now for production to grow in Venezuela,\u201d Randolph said.",
      "Meanwhile, in the years since Exxon and ConocoPhillips left Venezuela, U.S. oil companies have invested more than half a trillion dollars in extracting Canadian oil.",
      "\u201cAny increase in production of Venezuelan oil just drives down the value of Canadian oil,\u201d Randolph said.",
      "If U.S. oil companies were to return to Venezuela, he said, \u201cthey would be competing with themselves.\u201d",
      "They might also find they are subject to production quotas dictated by OPEC, the global organization of oil-producing nations. Venezuela is one of OPEC\u2019s founding members.",
      "\u201cDo U.S. oil companies want to go down there and be dictated to how much they can produce by OPEC?\u201d Randolph asked.",
      "Farah, of IBI, said it was difficult to imagine circumstances that would make Venezuela an attractive option for an oil company.",
      "\u201cThe broader question in Venezuela now is, given the quality of oil and how degraded their infrastructure is, who would want to go in to invest there, anyway?\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s deals with pharmaceutical companies are likely to have only a limited impact on Americans\u2019 drug spending, experts say.",
      "Since Sept. 30, the Trump administration has struck deals with 14 drugmakers in exchange for tariff relief, according to the White House.",
      "The agreements \u2014 which haven\u2019t gone into effect yet \u2014 adopt a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing model. They tie U.S. prices to those paid in other wealthy countries, lowering what Medicaid pays for the drugs, as well as offer discounts for people paying in cash through TrumpRx, a new self-pay platform.",
      "Most of the deals, however, don\u2019t affect what people with private insurance or Medicare pay for the drugs. People with Medicaid \u2014 who typically have minimal or no copays for prescriptions \u2014 already pay very little.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, most people with insurance coverage will continue to be better off using their insurance to obtain medications rather than purchasing through the TrumpRx direct-to-consumer portal,\u201d said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare Policy at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.",
      "Many aspects of the deals remain unknown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s virtually nothing on paper about them except for press releases,\u201d said Richard Frank, director of the center on health policy at \u200b\u200bthe Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear.\u201d",
      "A full list of drugs covered under the deals isn\u2019t available. However, the White House has announced several of them, including Merck\u2019s diabetes drug Januvia, Sanofi\u2019s blood thinner Plavix, Amgen\u2019s cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha, Genentech\u2019s flu medication Xofluza, Gilead Sciences\u2019 hepatitis C medication Epclusa, Novartis\u2019 multiple sclerosis drug Mayzent and Novo Nordisk\u2019s and Eli Lilly\u2019s blockbuster weight loss drugs Wegovy and Zepbound.",
      "Two of those drugs are already subject to Medicare price negotiations under President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act: Januvia was included in the first round, while Wegovy is part of the second.",
      "Some of the discounts made public are steep reductions off the list prices. Epclusa, for example, will cost $2,425 for people paying in cash through TrumpRx, down from $24,920. And the average monthly cost for Wegovy and Zepbound \u2014 which are currently available for $500 out of pocket \u2014 will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years.",
      "Art Caplan, the head of the medical ethics division at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, said that without a full list of drugs covered by the deals, it\u2019s difficult to assess their overall impact.",
      "Some of the drugs that have been named, Caplan said, aren\u2019t among the costliest in the U.S., or they already have generic versions that are typically cheaper for patients.",
      "Several generics are available for Plavix, including one sold by the drugmaker itself, for example. The hepatitis C drug Epclusa is also available as a generic. Some of the drugs that got price cuts but don\u2019t have generic equivalents are used by relatively few patients, Caplan said, and have a \u201ctiny\u201d impact on overall drug spending.",
      "Another drug, Xofluza, must be taken within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms, which could make it a poor fit for an online platform like TrumpRx, he said.",
      "In an email, a White House spokesperson said some of the lower prices will be available on TrumpRx \u201cearly this year\u201d and for Medicaid \u201cin the coming months.\u201d The administration hasn\u2019t yet released \u201ca comprehensive figure\u201d on expected out-of-pocket savings, the spokesperson added.",
      "Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said that for people without insurance or those with high-deductible plans, TrumpRx could offer meaningful savings compared with list prices.",
      "An estimated 26 million people in the U.S., or 8%, didn\u2019t have insurance in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "But for most people with insurance, she said, buying drugs through the platform is unlikely to be the better option \u2014 particularly for brand-name medications.",
      "Even with lower prices, \u201cwe\u2019re usually talking about hundreds of dollars per fill, and that ends up being a real problem for most people,\u201d Dusetzina said.",
      "Cubanski said that even large discounts may not make the drugs affordable for many patients paying out of pocket.",
      "\u201cA 50% discount on a $500 drug is nothing to sneeze at,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a lot of people will still struggle to pay $250 out of pocket on a monthly basis.\u201d",
      "The potential savings from extending the most favored nation pricing to state Medicaid programs are even harder to gauge, Cubanski said, because the details of the agreements haven\u2019t been made public. And even if states pay less, Medicaid enrollees themselves wouldn\u2019t see savings at the pharmacy counter.",
      "\u201cThese deals won\u2019t produce savings for Medicaid enrollees, since they already pay little to no cost sharing for drugs,\u201d she said.",
      "Caplan said Medicaid already pays the lowest prices for drugs in the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear where the money would be saved,\u201d he said.",
      "Drugmakers raise prices",
      "Trump\u2019s push is also unfolding alongside a wave of price increases by drugmakers.",
      "This year, drug companies have raised the prices of more than 350 brand name drugs, Reuters reported, citing research from 3 Axis Advisors, a health care consulting and research firm. The average price hikes were around 4%, the report said, in line with price increases last year.",
      "Frank, of the Brookings Institution, was skeptical of the agreements, saying it\u2019s possible the price cuts could be repackaged discounts that drugmakers were planning or already offering.",
      "\u201cIf companies choose what drugs are included in the deal, it\u2019s fair to assume they\u2019re not going to pick the ones that have the largest impact on revenue,\u201d Frank said.",
      "\u201cUntil we see that there\u2019s actually a real contract in place that is actually committing folks to a change in prices, it\u2019s hard to say that anything is going to happen,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that the deals are trivial, but rather they\u2019re not solid enough. In some cases, they may not be significant at all.\u201d",
      "At the same time, people\u2019s health insurance premiums have surged this year as enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired and health insurers raised rates. It remains unclear whether Congress will be able to work together to pass legislation to extend the tax credits.",
      "Dusetzina said that if people can\u2019t pay for health insurance, it\u2019s unlikely they would find prescription drugs \u2014 even at discounts \u2014 affordable.",
      "\u201cA lot of people would not find the prices available to be affordable,\u201d she said."

      "An anonymous Reddit user\u2019s claims of fraud and theft by an unnamed food delivery company appear to have been an artificial intelligence-fueled ruse that has spread across the internet, outpacing efforts to debunk it.",
      "The viral post, first published Friday, has elicited strong denials from major delivery apps that have been the subjects of past scrutiny for exploitive worker policies. It accrued more than 87,000 upvotes on Reddit and millions of impressions across other social media platforms where screenshots have circulated, before being removed by Reddit moderators Tuesday evening.",
      "Behind the scenes, as reporters tried to substantiate the claims, the ruse continued \u2014 still with AI.",
      "On Reddit, comments responding to the post generally accepted the claims as true.",
      "\u201cAs a human I think companies that try to charge different humans different amounts for the same things should no longer be allowed to operate,\u201d said one response, which received more than 1,800 upvotes.",
      "\u201cThis sounds like a massive class action lawsuit if you do things right, with a high chance for the drivers to win this one,\u201d another commenter wrote.",
      "The anonymous user first posted to the r/confession subcommunity last week, claiming they were exposing their company\u2019s secrets despite \u201ca massive NDA,\u201d or non-disclosure agreement, because they \u201ccan\u2019t sleep at night knowing I helped build this machine.\u201d",
      "The user, who did not identify a company by name, claimed that their employer uses predictive modeling to lower drivers\u2019 base pay based on their customers\u2019 tipping habits and that it has a hidden \u201cDesperation Score\u201d for drivers, which tracks how \u201cdesperate\u201d they are based on how willing they are to accept low-paying orders. The algorithm, the Reddit user claimed, would save the higher-paying orders for casual drivers to entice them to use the app.",
      "As the post gained traction online, its legitimacy also came into question.",
      "NBC News communicated with the person behind the Reddit account Friday via email and Signal. When the poster asked for proof of identity, an NBC News reporter sent a photo of her employee badge.",
      "Within days, other news outlets reported that the poster, in an attempt to prove their company affiliation, had sent journalists what appeared to be an Uber Eats employee badge. The image of the badge sent to them appeared to be an almost exact copy of the photo the poster had received from NBC News, but the badge included altered details, such as an Uber Eats logo on a background matching the company\u2019s colors.",
      "The Verge and Platformer, which both reported having been given the fake badge photo, ran it through Google\u2019s Gemini and found a SynthID watermark identifying it as having been either generated or edited by Google AI.",
      "A spokesperson for Uber confirmed to NBC News that there are no Uber Eats employee badges and that the company does not do what is alleged in the Reddit post or in any of the documents shared by the user.",
      "When NBC News tried to follow up with the Reddit user, their Signal and email accounts appeared to have been deleted. The user did not respond to a follow-up Reddit message.",
      "Andrew Macdonald, president and chief operating officer of Uber, wrote in a statement on X that the post is \u201cdefinitively not about us. I suspect it is completely made up. Don\u2019t trust everything you read on the internet.\u201d",
      "DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu also condemned the practices alleged in the post.",
      "\u201cThis is not DoorDash, and I would fire anyone who promoted or tolerated the kind of culture described in this Reddit post,\u201d Xu wrote on X. \u201cWe\u2019re not perfect by *any* stretch of the imagination, but we work every day to make our platform better for everyone who comes to it. What\u2019s described here is appalling, and if true, whoever is operating in this manner should be ashamed.\u201d",
      "Platformer founder Casey Newton told NBC News that the Reddit user gave him an 18-page document that they claimed were internal Uber documents. It included charts, diagrams and mathematical formulas, which almost fooled him. But then, Newton said, he noticed peculiarities in the formatting, the language and even the way it single-handedly backed up all of the poster\u2019s various allegations.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of a cartoon villain\u2019s document about how you would exploit a human being to the absolute maximum,\u201d Newton said. Soon, he said, the red flags pointed to the entire Reddit post\u2019s being a sham.",
      "To Newton, the saga was a reminder of how, in the age of increasingly sophisticated and accessible generative AI, anyone online can easily and quickly fool even the most discerning content consumers.",
      "Whether it\u2019s an employee ID that once took skilled Photoshop work or a bulky technical document that would have taken hours or days to falsify, much of the visual evidence that once could be easily believed must now be subject to more scrutiny.",
      "\u201cIt is really unfortunate that this post got millions of views, and I think there\u2019s some chance that millions of people now believe that there is a delivery company that is doing all of these things,\u201d Newton said.",
      "People are especially vulnerable to believing and resharing content that elicits emotional reactions like outrage, he said. And there is also the power of confirmation bias.",
      "Food or grocery delivery services like DoorDash and Instacart have faced accusations of exploitation in past years, when it was revealed that they used tips to subsidize part of their workers\u2019 base pay.",
      "Similarly, ride-share services like Uber and Lyft have faced multiple lawsuits for classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, allowing the companies to avoid providing minimum wage, overtime pay and other benefits. In 2023, Uber and Lyft paid a combined $328 million to settle allegations that they unlawfully withheld wages from drivers and failed to provide mandatory paid sick leave in New York state.",
      "Newton said posts like the one that went viral this week tend to be \u201cirresistible,\u201d because they confirm what many already believe about those companies.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for something to be shocked about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a post like this just kind of steps into that vacuum and says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to give you a great Saturday morning, and now you can be super, super mad at your food delivery app.\u2019\u201d"

      "Former reality TV star Spencer Pratt announced that he is running for Los Angeles mayor one year after one of the most destructive wildfires on record in California destroyed his home in Pacific Palisades.",
      "Pratt, husband of fellow ex-reality star Heidi Montag, has been a vocal critic of authorities\u2019 handling of the wildfire, which broke out Jan. 7, 2025, in the community nestled between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Los Angeles County coast. Much of his criticism has been aimed at California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.",
      "Pratt, 42, spoke Wednesday at a \u201cThey Let Us Burn\u201d rally by the Palisades Fire Residents Coalition to mark one year since the Palisades Fire.",
      "\u201cBusiness as usual is a death sentence for Los Angeles, and I\u2019m done waiting for someone to take real action. That\u2019s why I am running for mayor,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cBut let me be clear, this just isn\u2019t a campaign \u2014 this is a mission, and we are going to expose the system. We are going into every dark corner of L.A. politics and disinfecting the city with our light.",
      "\u201cL.A. is going to be camera-ready again,\u201d he continued.",
      "Pratt became a regular on \u201cThe Hills,\u201d after he and cast member Montag began dating. The couple married in 2008 and they have two children. The couple also appeared on \u201cI\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here\u201d and the British version of \u201cCelebrity Big Brother.\u201d",
      "On the day the Palisades Fire started, Pratt shared video of the flames and smoke. The couple later documented the extent of the destruction and what they lost.",
      "On the morning of Jan. 7, the Palisades Fire erupted and quickly spread to thousands of acres. Fanned by powerful Santa Ana winds that had been in the weather forecast for days, the 23,700-acre fire became the ninth-deadliest and third-most destructive wildfire on record in California.",
      "Twelve deaths were reported in connection with the Palisades Fire, which destroyed more than 6,800 structures.",
      "Incumbent Bass, former Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Austin Beutner and more than a dozen other candidates are in the race for mayor. The primary election is scheduled for June 2.",
      "The first day to file a declaration of intention to become a candidate is Feb. 2. The last day to file is Feb. 7.",
      "Bass was elected mayor in a 2022 race against Los Angeles businessman and developer Rick Caruso.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:57:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Stranger Things fans are convinced that the show didn't end. All about the Conformity Gate theory",
    "story": [
      "A group of \"Stranger Things\" fans are not ready for the story to be over.",
      "The viral theory dubbed Conformity Gate on social media proposes there is still one more episode left of the blockbuster Netflix hit beyond the two-hour series finale that was released on New Year's Eve.",
      "Fans believe that the real final episode will be released by Netflix on Jan. 7 to wrap up the story that ended in Episode 8 of Season 5, titled \"The Rightside Up.\" They think there is an Episode 9 that ends the series with a different storyline.",
      "Here's what to know about the online theories.",
      "What Is Conformity Gate?",
      "Warning: This section contains spoilers to the final season of \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "The epilogue to Episode 8 of the final season shows the long-time group of friends in fictional Hawkins, Indiana, graduate from high school and play a game of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" together like they did in the show's first season.",
      "Each character is then shown enjoying a happy ending to their individual story, from the romance between Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink) continuing to Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) thriving in college to Will (Noah Schnapp) living with a boyfriend in New York.",
      "Fans labeled the ending \"Conformity Gate\" because it represented  a frictionless, conformist ending rather than embracing the show's themes of breaking with the norm and defying external expectations.",
      "Why Do 'Stranger Things' Fans Believe There is Another Episode?",
      "Fans have gone down the rabbit hole with lengthy TikTok explainers and videos of scenes from the show's five seasons edited together to back up their theories.",
      "A theme behind the theories is that the happy endings for everyone were all an illusion created by the monstrous Vecna, the show's main villain. A humanoid that first appeared in Season 4, Vecna was originally human Henry Creel (Jamie Campbell Bower), who was sent to an alternate dimension by the powers of Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and became a monster.",
      "Fans have pointed out that all the students portrayed in the Hawkins graduation scene are sitting with their hands folded. They have likened the pose to one Creel once made before he became Vecna, as well as the character Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) when he was controlled by Vecna in Season 4.",
      "The ambiguous ending for Eleven, one of the show's primary characters, has also left fans divided over whether she died or not after defeating Vecna. Sink, who plays Max, has a clear position on it.",
      "Another image pushed by fans is that the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" binders owned by the main characters line up on a shelf to read \"X A LIE,\" which they think means that Vecna being beaten in Dimension X was a lie. However, on the show, it looks more like \"X AILE,\" which has no meaning.",
      "The speculation over the episode being released on Jan. 7 comes from multiple sources.",
      "Netflix released a cryptic teaser on Christmas saying \"Your Future is on its way\" with the date of Jan. 7, 2026, leading \"Stranger Things\" fans to thinking something big was coming even though it's not indicated in the video.",
      "The number seven also has meaning on \"Stranger Things\" because a die with the number seven facing up can be seen at the end of final episode to the right of a \"Stranger Things\" player manual. Noah Schnapp's character also rolls a seven while playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" in the show's first episode in the first season.",
      "Is There Another Episode Coming?",
      "Netflix has seemingly made it clear that the show is over with the bio on its Instagram and X accounts for \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "\"ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING,\" the bio reads.",
      "Schnapp, who plays Will Byers, also spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the end of the show.",
      "\"I remember crying a lot at the final table read,\" he said. \"They had us read it for the first time all together and I just think it was perfect. They really left nothing more to be told.\"",
      "\"Once I wrapped, I felt it was time to let Will go,\" he continued. \"Now I\u2019ve really made peace with it, and especially sharing these final episodes with the fans, the fact that these stories have been told and the journeys are done. Even though the story is over, I\u2019ll take with me the lessons I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m going to take the relationships with me forever, and I just hope this show can have a lasting, positive impact.\u201d",
      "For the final season, the streaming giant released the first four episodes on Thanksgiving, the next three on Christmas, and the final installment on New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "However, there is more coming out about Season Five. Netflix released a trailer on Jan. 5 for a documentary called \"One Last Adventure\" that will give a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the final season. The documentary starts streaming on Jan. 12.",
      "Twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, who created \"Stranger Things\" in 2016, were asked by the UK site Capital Buzz on Jan. 5 about theories that there is one more episode or an alternate ending that they shot and did not release.",
      "\u201cOh no,\u201d Matt Duffer said. \u201cI love when I hear people do that, but I\u2019m like, \u2018How do you have the time?\u2019 Oh my God! The energy to A, write it, and then shoot it. Are you crazy? No. No.\u201d",
      "While there is no indication of any secret episodes of \"Stranger Things,\" the Duffer brothers teased a spin-off of the show in a Jan. 1 interview with Variety. Matt Duffer said they will introduce \"completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.\u201d",
      "There also is a \"Stranger Things\" animated spin-off called \"Tales From '85\" set to come out in 2026."

      "Trump has repeatedly referred to his desire for Venezuela, which sits on the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, to open its market to American companies. On Tuesday he said Venezuela would \u201cbe turning over\u201d up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., adding that the revenue from the oil will be used to benefit both Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But pessimism about recent events in Venezuela isn\u2019t shared by all opposition supporters, including former political prisoner Luis Mata.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a pizza \u2014 they go slice by slice. We have to trust the process,\u201d the political activist and human rights defender living in exile told NBC News. Confusion surrounds the fate of the 800 to 900 political prisoners who remain incarcerated after the presidential elections on July 28, 2024.",
      "Mata, 26, was one of the thousands of volunteers who safeguarded vote tallies during the 2024 vote. The Maduro government overturned what independent election observers, rights groups and foreign governments said was a resounding opposition victory.",
      "Days after the election, Mata was detained by police officers as he tried to leave the city where he lived after hearing the government was looking for people who safeguarded the votes. He was charged with seven crimes and spent four months imprisoned in Tocor\u00f3n jail. He is now outside Venezuela.",
      "\u201cMany say the United States wants to seize the oil, but the United States is a trade ally. The United States supports freedom in Venezuela,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor me, change is closer than ever. Nicol\u00e1s is out of the country and will never set foot in Venezuela again,\u201d added Mata, who asked that NBC News not reveal his location out of security reasons. \u201cFreedom is about to arrive.\u201d",
      "Whether or not \u201cfreedom\u201d is about to sweep across Venezuela, the old regime is intent on projecting continuity. A striking symbol of this was when Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as president and the country\u2019s leadership marched shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the National Assembly on Monday.",
      "In the photograph released by the presidential palace, Rodr\u00edguez is flanked on one side by her brother and the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez. On her right is Diosdado Cabello, who as minister of the interior minister, justice and peace oversees police, counterintelligence forces and the \u201ccolectivos\u201d that have struck fear among many Venezuelans. Also surrounding her are seen minister of defense Vladimir Padrino, in full formal military uniform, and a smiling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, the son of the ousted leader.",
      "The image runs counter to repeated statements by Trump asserting that the U.S. is \u201cin charge\u201d in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going after anybody who potentially supported the U.S. mission to get Maduro,\u201d James Story, the last U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to go round them up, and they\u2019ve already rounded up some people. If they\u2019re doing that, then we don\u2019t run the country,\u201d said Story, who served as ambassador from 2018 to 2023.",
      "Marlenis, a domestic worker in Caracas, doesn\u2019t seem too worried about Trump\u2019s plans for Venezuela. She says that after 25 years of a system that has made her poorer every day, Venezuelans have nothing to lose by trying something different.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we lose?\u201d she said, while waiting for the bus to go home after work. \u201cIf everything goes badly, people are already used to bad things.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HAVANA \u2014 The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis.",
      "Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba\u2019s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba\u2019s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",
      "\u201cIf oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,\u201d said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. \u201cThis would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.\u201d",
      "Expecting more hardship",
      "In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%.",
      "\u201cThe situation here is going to become very difficult,\u201d said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. \u201cImagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts \u2026 young people are going to become even more pessimistic.\u201d",
      "There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cghost ships\u201d with their transponders turned off haven\u2019t slipped in.",
      "Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,\u201d Pi\u00f1\u00f3n said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia.",
      "Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country\u2019s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was \u201cpartially paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Content creator Pedro Luis Garc\u00eda said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the economic situation will be, but it will likely worsen because of the oil. But I don\u2019t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.\u201d",
      "Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%.",
      "Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen.",
      "Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government\u2019s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns.",
      "For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island\u2019s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba\u2019s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours.",
      "Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way.",
      "Cuba\u2019s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were \u201cpouring\u201d through Mexico and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d",
      "A defiant government response",
      "The day Maduro was captured, Cuba\u2019s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech. D\u00edaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the \u201cobscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel also said that \u201cfor Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.\u201d",
      "Cuba\u2019s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday.",
      "Cuba\u2019s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks.",
      "In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, declined to say what kind of further actions the U.S. could take against Cuba.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Cuba is already under heavy U.S. sanctions, but there are still other actions the U.S. can take. During Trump\u2019s first administration, the U.S. banned all flights to Cuba except for Havana.",
      "In Havana, former senior Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told NBC News, \u201cWe need to see what repercussions this will have. But the world hasn\u2019t ended as it seemed, and as Marco Rubio and Donald Trump would like to portray it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they are using intimidation to see if they can affect relations between Venezuela and Cuba, which I would say are not currently affected because Cuba and most Cubans support Venezuela in condemning the U.S. aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "Alzugaray added that Cuba\u2019s government should be in the midst of intense conversations and consultations with its allies, like China and Russia.",
      "Cuba, with a Soviet-style command economy, has been unwilling to loosen restrictions on the private sector and open its economy to foreign investment, as many allies like Vietnam and China have urged it to do.",
      "Vidal, the economist, said that when the USSR collapsed, it took the Cuban economy four years to hit rock bottom and begin to recover. Tourism, remittances and foreign investment helped rescue the economy from collapse in those years, something that hasn\u2019t happened this time around.",
      "\u201cToday, there is widespread distrust among the Cuban government\u2019s own international allies regarding the viability of its economic model and its finances,\u201d Vidal said. \u201cIn the 1990s, there was a stronger and more respected political leadership, both nationally and internationally, which is not the case now.\u201d",
      "Orlando Matos reported from Havana and Carmen Sesin from Miami."

      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "As he turned to go back inside, he told NBC News at the scene Friday, \u201chell\u201d erupted as a deadly fire broke out. \u201cI heard a big boom, and everybody was screaming,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari said a thick smoke enveloped the venue and the crowd, blinding him. He fell to the ground as people rushed to escape the bar, he said, but a man pulled him away to safety.",
      "His friends were not so lucky, he says. \u201cI have four friends who died,\u201d he said, still struggling to process the loss. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not real.\u201d",
      "Mehari, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said he saw someone he knew from school disfigured and burning, and others whose hair and clothes had burned off.",
      "\u201cSomebody was dying in front of me and I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHer face was so burned it was red.\u201d",
      "The bar was popular with local teenagers, he said. The legal drinking age is 16 in Switzerland.",
      "Mehari was among survivors taken to a hospital ward in Sion, where he was offered mental health assistance. \u201cI tried to sleep, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari\u2019s was among the harrowing witness accounts emerging Friday as investigators searched for answers. At least 40 people are dead and 119 injured, officials said, many of them with serious burns that a senior doctor treating them said will require \u201cmonths of rehabilitation\u201d and even have \u201clifelong consequences.\u201d",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press that he lost his jacket, shoes and phone while fleeing, though he was grateful to have made it out. \u201cI am still alive and it\u2019s just stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock.\u201d",

      "Laetitia Place, 17, said she was caught up in the chaos.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell, we were piled on top of each other, some people were burning, and some were dead next to us,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI was so scared \u2014 scared for myself, scared for my friends, scared for everyone inside.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cWe all saw really horrible things that no one should ever have to see.\u201d",
      "Eric Bonvin, the general director of the regional hospital in Sion that took in several dozen injured people, said those with severe burns face months of treatment.",
      "The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital.",
      "Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways.",
      "\u201cThere were inhalations of both smoke and also of heat that for some probably led to internal burns. That\u2019s a really catastrophic situation, as you can imagine,\u201d Bonvin said.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to live through for everyone. Also probably because everyone was asking themselves, \u2018Was my child, my cousin, someone from the region at this party?\u2019 This place was very well known as somewhere to celebrate the new year,\u201d Bonvin said. \u201cAlso, seeing young people arrive \u2014 that\u2019s always traumatic.\u201d",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill that the tankers were seized as part of \"stabilization\" efforts for Venezuela.",
      "He said that the interim authorities in Venezuela \"understand the only way they can move oil, generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States.\"",
      "U.S. Southern Command, which oversees military activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, announced on X that the U.S. had also apprehended M/T Sophia, \u201ca stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\u201d that it said was \u201coperating in international waters and conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea.\u201d",

      "Protesters in Iran defied authorities Tuesday, hitting the streets in the capital, Tehran, and smaller cities to chant anti-government slogans amid an ongoing violent crackdown that one human rights group says has left at least 36 dead.",
      "The protests began last week with economic grievances as the Iranian currency, the rial, tanked. They quickly turned political, with demonstrators chanting slogans against the ruling clergy.",
      "The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago \u2014 34 protesters and two members of the security forces \u2014 and that more than 2,000 people have been arrested.",
      "Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran\u2019s main bazaar Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.",
      "Another video shows a person using a makeshift flamethrower on security forces in the southern city of Shiraz.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for protesters' demands to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement.",
      "But the head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, warned Wednesday that there would be \u201cno leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic.\u201d Accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country, Ejei was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying there was \u201cno excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest.\u201d",
      "But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian\u2019s efforts at mediation \u2014 and the killings and arrests by security forces \u2014 have not persuaded the protesters to stay off the streets.",
      "\u201cThe system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. \u201cThe fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.\u201d",
      "Protesters got an unexpected offer of support last week when President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. would intervene if violence against protesters continued, though he did not specify what actions the U.S. might take.",

      "The detention of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a staunch Tehran ally, over the weekend only highlighted the issue for Iranian officials.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the operation to detain Maduro \"a clear example of state terrorism\" in a telephone call with his Venezuelan counterpart Saturday, according to the Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry\u2019s official website.",
      "\u201cWhat the threshold for U.S. intervention would be, or what it might look like, is not entirely clear but the leadership in Tehran is likely worried about the prospect of dealing with not just instability from below but military action from abroad,\u201d Vaez said.",
      "Some of the worst violence in recent days took place in the small town of Malekshahi and nearby Ilam in western Iran. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported that security forces opened fire on a crowd Saturday, killing five people and wounding more than 40 others.",

      "The wounded and dead from Saturday's violence in Malekshahi were taken to the Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam, where security forces stormed the compound and used batons, tear gas and live fire, according to Hengaw. A video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, shows a member of the security forces shooting into the hospital courtyard where people were gathered behind a gate.",
      "The U.S. State Department's Farsi language account on X posted a video of the security forces rushing into the Ilam hospital compound below text that read, \"Hospitals are not battlefields.\" The post also called the raid \"a crime.\"",

For those who quietly oppose the Maduro government, they hope they\u2019re finally seeing the end of a dark period of their history. For those who supported him, there\u2019s the uncertainty of what will happen to their leader.",
      "Daniel, a gardener who commutes from his home on the outskirts of Caracas to the upscale neighborhood of Altamira, said he stayed home on Monday because he was afraid of encountering pro-government groups that are widely reported to be checking people\u2019s cellphones. Like everyone interviewed for this story, Daniel asked not to be fully identified out of fear of reprisal from authorities that are very much still in power.",

President Donald Trump has made clear as of now that he supports the leadership of Maduro\u2019s vice president and successor, Delcy Rodriguez, who has said she is willing to work with the United States.",
      "Still, intractable issues remain. The government continues to be willing to use intimidation and violence to remain in power and shows few signs of trying to fix an economy that has trapped 90% of the population in poverty despite the country\u2019s vast oil wealth. Hundreds of people are still in prison after they were arrested during protests following the July 2024 election, where there was credible evidence Maduro\u2019s opposition won.",
      "On Sunday morning, Josefina and her husband, both 70-year-old retirees, were driving along Boyac\u00e1 Avenue, a highway that carves an east-to-west path across Caracas alongside Waraira Repano National Park. The road is popular on weekends when families take in the views of nature surrounding the city.",

      "The European leaders were in Paris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and others, according to a White House official. It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Though these negotiations have accelerated since November, the U.S. attack on Venezuela and continued suggestions of seizing Greenland have cast a shadow over the talks, which are being held with the very allies that \u2014 under NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense \u2014 Trump has suggested attacking.",
      "\u201cThe Kingdom of Denmark \u2014 including Greenland \u2014 is part of NATO,\u201d the allies said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cSecurity in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\u201d said the statement, issued by the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark.",
      "It added that \u201cthe United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally\u201d and through a 1951 defense agreement allowing Washington to build military bases on the vast island. \u201cGreenland belongs to its people,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\u201d",

      "\"Denigrating our Allies serves no purpose and there is NO up side,\" he said. \"It weakens us by diminishing trust between friends, and Russia and China love it. So\u2026 stop the stupid 'we want Greenland BS.'\"",
      "One of the key elements being discussed in Paris is Ukraine and Europe\u2019s desire for \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d which could come in the form of a multinational force being deployed to Ukraine to ensure Russia does not launch further attacks.",

But Trump has indicated he may instead turn that might against a NATO ally, telling NBC News on Monday that he was \u201cvery serious\u201d in his ambitions to take control of Greenland.",
      "Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, took this a step further. He told CNN that \"obviously Greenland should be part of the U.S.\" because of what he described as the island's geostrategic importance in helping Washington fulfill its role as \"the power of NATO.\"",
      "\"The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\" he said. \"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over Greenland,\" Miller added.",

      "Denmark is a NATO partner, and dozens of its troops died fighting in U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "Many experts believe that U.S. military action to seize the territory would spell the end of the alliance and mark a new nadir for transatlantic ties that are already strained under Trump.",
      "\u201cIt would de facto mean that NATO was dead because many European nations would simply say, \u2018OK, we cannot rely on the Americans anymore,\u2019\u201d said Peter Viggo Jakobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College.",

    "story": [
      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for more than a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "Venezuela will not have new elections in the next 30 days, President Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Monday, projecting a longer-term engagement two days after U.S. forces captured that nation's leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We have to fix the country first. You can\u2019t have an election. There\u2019s no way the people could even vote,\" Trump said about the possibility of a vote in the next month. \"No, it\u2019s going to take a period of time. We have \u2014 we have to nurse the country back to health.\"",
      "Moreover, he said, the U.S. may subsidize an effort by oil companies to rebuild the country's energy infrastructure \u2014 a project he said could take less than 18 months.",
      "\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,\" he said. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\"",
      "He also insisted the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.",
      "\"No, we\u2019re not,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re at war with people that sell drugs. We\u2019re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country.\"",
      "In the roughly 20-minute interview, Trump identified a group of U.S. officials \u2014 including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who will help oversee America\u2019s involvement in Venezuela.",
      "\"It's a group of all. They have all expertise, different expertise,\" he said.",
      "But he had a one-word answer for who is ultimately in charge: \u201cMe.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s discussion of his vision for Venezuela came just a couple of hours after Maduro was arraigned in New York on a series of charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. He was seized from a compound in the capital city of Caracas in the wee hours of Saturday morning during a raid by U.S. special forces and law enforcement officials.",
      "Maduro pleaded not guilty, saying he remains the leader of his country even as Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in Monday as his successor.",
      "Trump said Rodr\u00edguez has been cooperating with U.S. officials but insisted there was no communication between her camp and the American side before Maduro's ouster.",
      "\"No, that\u2019s not the case,\" he said, adding that a determination will be made soon about whether existing sanctions against Rodr\u00edguez will be left in place or lifted.",
      "When asked if there was \"any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove\" Maduro, Trump replied, \"Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,\" adding that it was without the help of Maduro's inner circle.",
      "Trump also declined to say whether he's spoken to Rodr\u00edguez yet, but he said that Rubio \"speaks to her fluently in Spanish\" and that their \"relationship has been very strong.\"",
      "He indicated that the U.S. could launch a second military incursion into Venezuela if Rodr\u00edguez stops cooperating with U.S. officials but said he does not believe that will be necessary. Trump also suggested he had initially expected to have to send in American forces again already.",
      "\"We\u2019re prepared to do it,\" he said. \"We anticipated doing it, actually.\"",
      "Trump also denied a Washington Post report that he had dismissed the possibility of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado running the country because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year \u2014 an award long sought by Trump.",
      "\"She should not have won it,\" he said. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\"",
      "Having campaigned on an \"America First\" platform and his desire to end wars, rather than start them, Trump has seen some of his political allies question the wisdom of the U.S. entering into a long-term commitment in Venezuela.",
      "But he said in the interview that he is confident his political base will stick with him.",
      "\"MAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I\u2019m doing. MAGA loves everything I do,\" Trump said. \"MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\"",
      "Critics in both parties have noted that Trump did not seek a new authorization from Congress to launch Saturday morning's raid, and he said in the interview that he would not need lawmakers to act in order for him to send American troops back in.",
      "\"We have good support congressionally,\" he said. \"And Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn't they support us?\"",
      "When asked what Congress \"knew\" \u2014 and whether any lawmakers had advance notification about the operation \u2014 Trump declined to elaborate.",
      "\"I don't want to get into that,\" he replied, \"but people knew.\""

      "Trump threatened military action against Colombia, drawing backlash from its president, but said there were no plans for immediate intervention in Cuba, predicting its government was \"just going to fall.\" He again outlined his desire to take over Greenland, drawing widespread pushback including from NATO ally Denmark, which governs the Arctic island nation.",

      "On when elections might be held, he said \"Well we're going to run everything. We're going to run it, fix it. We'll have elections at the right time.\"",
      "Asked who was currently in charge of Venezuela, Trump said, \"We're dealing with the people. We're dealing with the people that just got sworn in. And don't ask me who's in charge, because I'll give you an answer, and it'll be very controversial.\"",

The oil is just flowing at a very low level,\" Trump said. \"So we're going to have the big oil companies go in, and they're going to fix the infrastructure. They're going to invest money. We're not going to invest anything. We're going to just take care of the country. We're going to cherish the country. We're going to take care, more importantly, of the people, including Venezuelans.\"",
