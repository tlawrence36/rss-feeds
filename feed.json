      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life",
      "CHICAGO -- John Hauldren has been a Chicago Cubs fan all his life. During the team\u2019s last homestand, he got a text message from a high school friend. It was the first text he had received from him.",
      "Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used \u201cFront to Back\u201d \u2014 a song from Hauldren's electronic music group, Levity \u2014 as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "\u201cI was like \u2018What? Like, no way,'\" Hauldren recalled. \u201cI, like, had to do my research for myself.\u201d",
      "Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.",
      "Crow-Armstrong's girlfriend has a cousin who is friends with the girlfriend of PJ Carberry, another member of Levity.",
      "\u201cMy girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona,\u201d Crow-Armstrong said. \u201cI had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it.\u201d",
      "Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June's \u201cStill Boomin\u201d for his walkup song. He said he isn't a big fan of dubstep \u2014 the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time \u2014 but he likes Levity's stuff.",
      "Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrong's daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song.",
      "\u201cMusic\u2019s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong\u2019s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.",
      "But he was always a Cubs fan.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.\u201d",
      "The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.",
      "Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of \u201cFront to Back\u201d at their place in Bucktown \u2014 not far from Wrigley Field.",
      "\u201cMy window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,\u201d Hauldren said. \u201cAnd so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.\u201d",
      "After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.",
      "Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago's Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.\u201d",

      "This time, Italian American comedians Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco will make their debut during a comical promotion, the network said on Wednesday. The commercial will air during NBC\u2019s Kentucky Derby coverage on Saturday.",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In 2019, David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman",
      "In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record.",
      "David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman.",
      "At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \u201cThe Politician\u201d and \u201cHollywood.\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him.",
      "But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

      "Think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d translated to Napoleonic-era France",
      "He\u2019s a dream in the kitchen \u2014 and elsewhere in the house. He makes a mean cream-puff tower. And he\u2019s got moves like Jagger.",
      "Alas, Antonin Car\u00eame has been dead since the 1830s, but nobody\u2019s perfect, right?",
      "Most people have heard of Napoleon, but not many are familiar \u2014 even in France \u2014 with the story of this chef who cooked for him and his contemporaries, rising from a poor kitchen boy to become a standard-bearer of French cuisine. Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",
      "But for the vibe, think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d set in post-revolutionary Paris. Car\u00eame even directs his staff at one point to say \u201cOui, chef.\u201d (And we could totally imagine him, like Jeremy Allen White, in a Calvin Klein underwear ad, if those had existed back then.)",
      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",
      "Still, his goal was to be the best chef in the world. The show\u2019s first season ends with an extraordinary outdoor coronation banquet that Car\u00eame creates for thousands of people. When he places, in triumph, a tall white chef\u2019s hat on his head for the first time, it's as if he's crowning himself \u2014 and marking his ascent to celebrity.",
      "Benjamin Voisin, who's in virtually every scene, plays Car\u00eame with a scruffy head of hair, a gold earring and a bad-boy swagger that's consciously based on Mick Jagger, circa \u201970s.",
      "Director Martin Bourboulon says the choice for the role was obvious once Voisin walked into the audition room.",
      "\u201cWhen you find the right actor for the right part, 80% of the job is done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were very impressed with his youthful attitude but also his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude. He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",

      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",

      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",
      "The rowdy bridesmaid, Pinto said. She's somebody who might have had a bit too much Champagne and feels like she should be in charge.",
      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new,\u201d says \u201cSuperman\u201d director James Gunn. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about the robots and the flying dogs and all that stuff. It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople say, like, do you feel pressure and the most pressure I feel is from myself as a fan and to Steven Spielberg, to not disappoint him,\" says \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d director Gareth Edwards. \u201cWeirdly what\u2019s great about doing a Jurassic movie is that everybody knows deep down that like half the reason they\u2019re in this business is because of that film and Steven\u2019s work.\u201d",

      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",
      "\u201cBy the end of this summer, hopefully people aren\u2019t talking about being in a funk anymore and it feels like we got our mojo back and we\u2019re off to the races,\" Kosinski, who directed the pandemic-era hit \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d says.",

      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "The retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.",
      "Weinstein's attorneys have argued that all three accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",
      "Last year\u2019s AFI honoree was Nicole Kidman. Other recent recipients include John Williams, Mel Brooks, Denzel Washington and Julie Andrews.",

      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most classic films of the late 1970s and 1980s",
      "\u201cMe love you long time,\u201d a Vietnamese sex worker tells the U.S. troops, swiveling her hips as she hawks her services. \u201cYou party?\u201d The first female character in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam War classic \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d she appears for just a moment \u2014 and halfway through the film.",
      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "Wrexham has sealed promotion to the second tier of English soccer by beating Charlton 3-0",
      "WREXHAM, Wales -- Wrexham fans ignored the warnings. They were always going to.",
      "By the time the final whistle blew on Saturday to confirm promotion to English soccer's second tier, thousands were ready and waiting to storm the home field in celebration.",
      "Flares were lit, red smoke filled the air, Welsh flags were waved proudly and songs sung raucously.",
      "Wrexham was one step from the Premier League and nothing was going to stop this party.",
      "Charlton was beaten 3-0 to ensure Wrexham went up as the third division runner-up behind champion Birmingham, and co-owner Ryan Reynolds reflected on their third promotion in three seasons.",
      "\u201cIt just seemed like an impossible dream,\u201d the movie star said. \u201cWe said five years ago our goal was to make it to the Premier League. There were understandably a lot of laughs, but it feels like a thing that could make it to fruition right now.\u201d",
      "There were warnings of police action for pitch invaders before kickoff. And as the game reached its final moments, an announcement over the loudspeaker told fans it could be stopped if they didn't move back behind barricades.",
      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",
      "The Welsh soccer team's remarkable rise under Hollywood owners Reynolds and Rob McElhenney has hit a new high \u2014 returning to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign.",
      "It means that from next season it will be playing one level below the Premier League, something that was unthinkable just four years ago when it was a struggling non-league team.",
      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",
      "\u201cThe stadium and atmosphere is incredible, it\u2019s a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now,\u201d said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win.",
      "Who knows what's next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world.",
      "\u201cThe owners have come in and done an amazing job. I\u2019m so pleased for them because they deserve it,\u201d manager Phil Parkinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had success over the last three years.\u201d",
      "While celebrations greeted the final whistle, the party began much earlier after promotion rival Wycombe lost to Leyton Orient 1-0.",
      "Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.",
      "Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries \u201cWelcome to Wrexham.\u201d",
      "Fans erupted in cheers after the final whistle of Wycombe\u2019s loss, which was shown on a big screen.",
      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is for those supporters who followed the team in those 15 years in the (non-league) National League in really, really tough times, but stood strong behind their club and they deserve tonight,\u201d Parkinson said.",

    "story": [
      "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian ex-President Jair Bolsonaro, who continues to recover after undergoing bowel surgery, has left intensive care, his doctors said Thursday.",
      "The medical team at the DF Star Hospital in Brasilia said that he left intensive care on Wednesday and there is no set discharge date from the facility. His health condition is stable and he has begun receiving a liquid diet.",
      "Bolsonaro underwent a 12-hour surgery on April 13 to remove intestinal adhesions and reconstruct the abdominal wall. It was the sixth procedure related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in September 2018.",
      "He has been in and out of hospitals since the attack and underwent multiple surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.",
      "Doctors described the latest surgery as the \u201cmost complex\u201d since the stabbing, requiring a \u201cvery delicate and prolonged post-surgery.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro was admitted with severe abdominal pain to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, on April 11 and then transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. His family later requested his transfer to Brasilia.",
      "He had been preparing for a trip across northeast Brazil to promote his Liberal Party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running. The region traditionally has been a political bastion of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Bolsonaro is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court for allegedly attempting to stage a coup in January 2023, with riots led by his supporters in Brasilia.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is again trying to rehire some staffers who were recently fired amid mass layoffs at the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors.",
      "More than 20 of the agency\u2019s roughly 60 travel staff will be reinstated, according to two FDA staffers notified of the plan this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation.",
      "The same uncertainty hangs over employees who process agency records for release to lawyers, companies and journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. About 100 of those staffers were recently eliminated, according to an agency official with direct knowledge of the situation.",
      "But in recent days the FDA has missed multiple court-ordered deadlines to produce documents, which could result in hefty fines. That's prompted plans to bring back a significant number of those staffers.",
      "The apparent reversals are the latest examples of the haphazard approach to agency cuts that have shrunk FDA\u2019s workforce by an estimated 20%, or about 3,500 jobs, in addition to an unspecified number of retirements, voluntary buyouts and resignations.",
      "In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days after pushback from industry, Congress and other parties.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services hasn't detailed exactly which positions or programs were cut in the mass layoffs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has repeatedly said that no FDA scientists were fired as part of the reductions. But at least two dozen food scientists who worked in a San Francisco testing laboratory and a Chicago research center were let go in March.",
      "An HHS spokesperson suggested the apparent mix-up was due to \u201cthe fractured, outdated HR infrastructure we inherited from the Biden administration and are now actively overhauling.\u201d The spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about which employees are being reinstated but said the administration will \u201cstreamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us.\u201d",
      "About 15 scientists working in FDA\u2019s Division of Food Processing Science and Technology in Chicago were told last week they be will reinstated, according to a staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But a week later there has been no written confirmation and the scientists have not returned to the office. The group\u2019s research includes studying ways to prevent harmful bacteria from growing on produce and preventing the spread of microplastics and other particles from food packaging.",
      "\u201cI hope Commissioner Makary continues to assess these ill-informed cuts and works to bring back impacted employees expeditiously,\u201d said Susan Mayne of Yale University, the FDA\u2019s former food director. \u201cHis legacy as commissioner is on the line.\u201d",
      "With more than 15,000 employees remaining across various U.S. and foreign offices, the FDA\u2019s core responsibilities are reviewing new drugs, medical products and food ingredients as well as inspecting thousands of factories.",
      "Makary has said no inspectors or medical reviewers were fired as part of the recent reductions. But current and former FDA officials note that those frontline employees are often supported by teams of administrative staff.",
      "FDA inspectors, for example, have long relied on travel bookers to coordinate trips to India and other countries that often involve visa permissions, security measures, ground transportation, tech support, translation services and other logistics. Inspectors can spend up to half the year traveling, a grueling workload that makes recruiting and retaining staff a challenge.",
      "For a brief period last month, inspectors were told they would be booking their own travel. The FDA set up a hotline to assist with making the arrangements. Then, agency leaders developed a plan to hire an outside contractor to perform the work.",
      "On Monday, staffers were informed that about a third of the fired staff who performed the work would be returning.",

      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to provisional data posted Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That\u2019s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.",
      "The maternal mortality rate rose to 19 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 18.6 the year before.",
      "The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.",
      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.",
      "But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, experts say. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.",
      "The U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found wide racial disparities in such deaths, with Black women dying at a far higher rate than white women.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",
      "In March, Texas filed criminal charges against a Houston midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions, and the state is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida is poised to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates who say the mineral is a safe, effective way to protect people of all ages from developing cavities.",
      "Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill Tuesday. The measure now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against the fluoridation of community water systems, arguing high levels could pose a risk to children\u2019s intellectual development.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water is considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "\u201cAs dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it\u2019s a real tragedy when policymakers\u2019 decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,\u201d Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cBlindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy.\u201d",
      "While Florida's bill doesn't specifically reference fluoride, it will require the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state, said bill sponsor Republican state Rep. Kaylee Tuck.",
      "\u201cAnything that relates to water quality, removing contaminants, things like that, we're not touching that,\" Tuck said. \"It's anything that has to do with health. So fluoride, vitamins, whatever else it is.\u201d",
      "Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month, approving legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride has come under increased scrutiny under the influence of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",
      "Some local officials in Florida have already voted to remove the mineral from their community water systems, ahead of state lawmakers' push to ban fluoride.",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Tuesday she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the passage of the bill, adding that it disregards \u201cthe overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\u201d",
      "Levine Cava said that ending fluoridation, which is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay, will have \u201clong-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "The mayor said the decision should be left to local communities.",
      "About one-third of community water systems, serving more than 60% of the U.S. population, fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 analysis by the CDC.",

    "story": [
      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly approved paid sick leave laws last year",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska were asked last year whether they wanted to require employers to provide paid sick leave to their workers. They overwhelmingly said yes.",
      "Now some lawmakers in each of those states are trying to roll back the benefits, citing concerns from businesses about costs.",
      "The efforts mark the latest attempt by legislators to alter laws backed by the voters they represent. In February, for example, Michigan enacted revisions to a paid sick leave law initiated by voters seven years ago, delaying the date when small businesses must comply and allowing a longer period before new employees are eligible.",
      "Though some voters are outraged, some lawmakers contend that citizen activists who crafted the initiatives overlooked the realities of running a business.",
      "Restaurant owner Tim Hart, who employs about two dozen workers at his steakhouse in Hannibal, Missouri, said the paid sick leave requirement imposes a double financial hit because he must pay one person to stay home and another to fill the shift.",
      "\u201cWhen this goes into effect, we very likely won\u2019t survive,\u201d said Hart, who has urged the state Senate to halt the law.",
      "The paid sick leave laws are set to kick in Thursday in Missouri, July 1 in Alaska and Oct. 1 in Nebraska.",
      "McDonald's restaurant worker Richard Eiker is among those who stand to benefit. He signed a petition putting the initiative on the Missouri ballot and traveled recently from Kansas City to the state Capitol to lobby lawmakers to let the law stand.",
      "In 40 years on the job, Eiker has never received paid sick leave \u2014 not even when he was struggling with a kidney stone.",
      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",
      "But many workers already have it tough, Democratic lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck, just missing a little bit of work can really put them behind,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Patty Lewis said.",
      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",
      "Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, which supported the ballot measure, doubts Ruffridge\u2019s bill will gain traction in the final weeks of this year's session.",
      "But, she said, \u201cI believe this is the beginning of a long battle to protect the voters\u2019 wishes from the wills and the whims of the businesspeople who don\u2019t want to pay sick days.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- John Goldsmith was too young to fight in World War II, but he remembers the rationing, the blackouts and the bombs that devastated his neighborhood in east London. And he remembers the party when peace returned to Europe.",
      "Church bells rang across the city, bonfires were lit and conga lines snaked through Piccadilly Circus as people filled the streets to celebrate the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. For a 14-year-old boy, May 8, 1945, also brought something else: an end to the tedium of wartime rules and restrictions.",
      "\u201cWell, it was such a contrast. Suddenly, freedom! Mucking about. Doing all sorts of things that were frowned upon as not being the right thing to do,\u201d Goldsmith, now 94, said.",
      "\u201cBut now, for instance, all these wonderful pictures of Piccadilly and places like that. Buses covered with people standing on the roof just going barmy \u2014 not necessarily due to drink or anything of that nature. But definitely, they were letting their hair down,\u2019\u2019 he added with a giggle.",
      "Victory in Europe Day was a moment of relief for a city scarred by bombing raids and rocket attacks that killed an estimated 30,000 civilians throughout the war and didn\u2019t end until just a few weeks earlier. But it was also a time to look forward to the safe return of husbands, sons, brothers \u2014 and sisters \u2014 who were serving abroad, and to hope that lives put on hold in 1939 might soon return to normal.",
      "While D-Day was all about the troops who landed on the beaches of northern France to begin the liberation of Europe, V-E Day was a moment for the public, for everyone who sacrificed for the common good.",
      "Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who had inspired Britain during its darkest days, caught the mood of the nation when he announced the victory at 3 p.m. on May 8.",
      "\u201cMy dear friends, this is your hour,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not victory of a party or of any class. It\u2019s a victory of the great British nation as a whole.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a message Goldsmith wants people to remember before the World War II generation fades from the scene. A retired architect and amateur artist, he has long regaled his family with stories of his boyhood in the Bow neighborhood of east London. After a bit of prodding from his wife, Margaret, he recently began sketching the scenes so others could see what he lived through.",
      "\u201cThe soldiers, the airmen, the sailors can\u2019t operate without the people supporting them and backing them,\u2019\u2019 Goldsmith said. \u201cSo if we the people don\u2019t contribute, the armored elements will collapse. So it\u2019s so important that V-E Day should be \u2026 the people\u2019s day.\u2019\u2019",
      "While Londoners had been anticipating the end of the fighting in Europe for weeks, the announcement was like the cork popping out of a giant bottle of champagne in a city that had lived in the shadow of war for six years.",
      "Nowhere was the relief felt more deeply than in the East End, where thousands of homes, schools and businesses were reduced to rubble as Nazi bombers pounded docks and warehouses along the River Thames during the onslaught that became known as The Blitz. When Buckingham Palace was bombed on Sept. 13, 1940, Queen Elizabeth reportedly told a policeman she was glad, because \u201cit makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\u201d",
      "Goldsmith's drawings capture the day The Blitz began, with Nazi bombers filling the air and fires turning the night sky a molten volcanic red behind the docks. There's also the time a cricket match was suspended as one of the flying bombs known as \u201cdoodlebugs\u201d soared overhead, and the ghostly image of a rent collector emerging from a cloud of dust after a V-2 rocket, a type of long-range ballistic missile, obliterated a block of houses.",
      "The last V-2 to hit London destroyed an apartment building less than two miles from his home on March 27, 1945.",
      "Eighty years later, Goldsmith holds back tears when he remembers the moment he heard that the Nazis had surrendered.",
      "He and his friends were playing street soccer using a tennis ball \u2014 soccer balls being scarce after six years of war \u2014 when a young boy ran out of the nearby dairy and shouted simply, \u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to be very careful now, because I could break up,\u2019\u2019 Goldsmith said, pausing to collect himself. \u201cBut that was the point when you realized: \u2018I didn\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "People had seen the end coming, but didn\u2019t dare to believe it could be true.",

      "\u201cConclave,\u201d the film may have introduced movie-goers to the spectacular ritual and drama of a modern conclave, but the periodic voting to elect a new pope has been going on for centuries and created a whole genre of historical trivia",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 \u201cConclave,\u201d the movie, may have introduced movie-goers to the spectacular ritual and drama of a modern conclave, but the periodic voting to elect a new pope has been going on for centuries and created a whole genre of historical trivia.",
      "Here are some fun facts about conclaves past, derived from historical studies including Miles Pattenden's \u201cElecting the Pope in Early Modern Italy, 1450\u20131700\u201d and interviews with experts including Elena Cangiano, an archeologist at Viterbo's Palazzo dei Papi (Palace of the Popes).",
      "In the 13th century, it took almost three years \u2014 1,006 days to be exact \u2014 to choose Pope Clement IV's successor, making it the longest conclave in the Catholic Church\u2019s history. It's also where the term conclave comes from \u2014 \"under lock and key,\" because the cardinals who were meeting in Viterbo, north of Rome, took so long the town's frustrated citizens locked them in the room.",
      "The secret vote that elected Pope Gregory X lasted from November 1268 to September 1271. It was the first example of a papal election by \u201ccompromise,\u201d after a long struggle between supporters of two main geopolitical medieval factions \u2014 those faithful to the papacy and those supporting the Holy Roman Empire.",
      "Gregory X was elected only after Viterbo residents tore the roof off the building where the prelates were staying and restricted their meals to bread and water to pressure them to come to a conclusion. Hoping to avoid a repeat, Gregory X decreed in 1274 that cardinals would only get \u201cone meal a day\u201d if the conclave stretched beyond three days, and only \u201cbread, water and wine\u201d if it went beyond eight. That restriction has been dropped.",
      "Before 1274, there were times when a pope was elected the same day as the death of his predecessor. After that, however, the church decided to wait at least 10 days before the first vote. Later that was extended to 15 days to give all cardinals time to get to Rome. The quickest conclave observing the 10-day wait rule appears to have been the 1503 election of Pope Julius II, who was elected in just a few hours, according to Vatican historian Ambrogio Piazzoni. In more recent times, Pope Francis was elected in 2013 on the fifth ballot, Benedict XVI won in 2005 on the fourth and Pope Pius XII won on the third in 1939.",
      "The first conclave held under Michelangelo's frescoed ceiling in the Sistine Chapel was in 1492. Since 1878, the world-renowned chapel has become the venue of all conclaves. \u201cEverything is conducive to an awareness of the presence of God, in whose sight each person will one day be judged,\u201d St. John Paul II wrote in his 1996 document regulating the conclave, \u201cUniversi Dominici Gregis.\u201d The cardinals sleep a short distance away in the nearby Domus Santa Marta hotel or a nearby residence.",
      "Most conclaves were held in Rome, with some taking place outside the Vatican walls. Four were held in the Pauline Chapel of the papal residence at the Quirinale Palace, while some 30 others were held in St. John Lateran Basilica, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva or other places in Rome. On 15 occasions they took place outside Rome and the Vatican altogether, including in Viterbo, Perugia, Arezzo and Venice in Italy, and Konstanz, Germany and Lyon, France.",
      "Between 1378-1417, referred by historians to as the Western Schism, there were rival claimants to the title of pope. The schism produced multiple papal contenders, the so-called anti-popes, splitting the Catholic Church for nearly 40 years. The most prominent anti-popes during the Western Schism were Clement VII, Benedict XIII, Alexander V, and John XXIII. The schism was ultimately resolved by the Council of Constance in 1417, which led to the election of Martin V, a universally accepted pontiff.",
      "The cloistered nature of the conclave posed another challenge for cardinals: staying healthy. Before the Domus Santa Marta guest-house was built in 1996, cardinal electors slept on cots in rooms connected to the Sistine Chapel. Conclaves in the 16th and 17th centuries were described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cbadly smelling,\u201d with concern about disease outbreaks, particularly in summer, according to historian Miles Pattenden. \u201cThe cardinals simply had to have a more regular and comfortable way of living because they were old men, many of them with quite advanced disease,\u201d Pattenden wrote. The enclosed space and lack of ventilation further aggravated these issues. Some of the electors left the conclave sick, often seriously.",
      "Initially, papal elections weren\u2019t as secretive but concerns about political interference soared during the longest conclave in Viterbo. Gregory X decreed that cardinal electors should be locked in seclusion, \u201ccum clave\u201d (with a key), until a new pope was chosen. The purpose was to create a totally secluded environment where the cardinals could focus on their task, guided by God\u2019s will, without any political interference or distractions. Over the centuries, various popes have modified and reinforced the rules surrounding the conclave, emphasizing the importance of secrecy.",
      "Pope John XII was just 18 when he was elected in 955. The oldest popes were Pope Celestine III (elected in 1191) and Celestine V (elected in 1294) who were both nearly 85. Benedict XVI was 78 when he was elected in 2005.",
      "There is no requirement that a pope be a cardinal, but that has been the case for centuries. The last time a pope was elected who wasn\u2019t a cardinal was Urban VI in 1378. He was a monk and archbishop of Bari. While the Italians have had a stranglehold on the papacy over centuries, there have been many exceptions aside from John Paul II (Polish in 1978) and Benedict XVI (German in 2005) and Francis (Argentine in 2013). Alexander VI, elected in 1492, was Spanish; Gregory III, elected in 731, was Syrian; Adrian VI, elected in 1522, was from the Netherlands.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been on a campaign against Iran's nuclear program and his opposition helped convince President Trump to withdraw from an Obama era deal meant to rein it in",
      "JERUSALEM -- When the U.S. and Iran met for nuclear talks a decade ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against an emerging deal from the world\u2019s most public stages, including in a fiery speech to Congress seen as a direct challenge to the Obama administration as it was wrapping up the talks.",
      "Now, as the sides sit down to discuss a new deal, Netanyahu has fallen silent.",
      "Netanyahu sees an Iran with nuclear weapons as an existential threat to Israel, and he is just as wary of any new U.S. agreement with its archenemy that may not meet his standards. Yet he finds himself shackled with Donald Trump in the White House.",
      "Netanyahu is unwilling to publicly criticize a president who has shown broad support for Israel, whom he deems to be Israel's greatest friend, and who doesn't take well to criticism.",
      "He \u201ccan't do anything that goes against Trump. He's paralyzed,\u201d said Yoel Guzansky, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv-based think tank.",
      "Israel is in a position of power against Iran after a series of strategic achievements over the past 18 months in the wars that have shaken the Middle East. It thrashed Iran\u2019s allies in Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, and directly attacked Iran last year, neutralizing some of its key air defenses. Experts say Israel now has a window of opportunity for what could be an effective strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, with possibly less regional blowback.",
      "Yet Israel\u2019s leader was recently unable to galvanize Trump to prioritize a strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities \u2014 which would likely hinge on U.S. military assistance to be successful. With the U.S. negotiating with Iran, Israel has little legitimacy to pursue a military option on its own.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu is trapped,\u201d said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe was banking on Israel\u2019s position relative to Iran to improve under Trump. In practice, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu and his nationalist supporters hoped Trump\u2019s return to the White House would be advantageous because of his history of support for Israel. They thought that, under Trump, the U.S. might back a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "But Trump\u2019s approach to Iran \u2014 as well as on other issues, such as tariffs \u2014 has shown the relationship is more complicated, and that Trump\u2019s interests don\u2019t entirely align with Netanyahu\u2019s.",
      "Netanyahu has long accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapon and went on a global campaign against the Obama deal. He painted the nuclear program as an existential threat to Israel and the world, and said the agreement was too weak to contain it. Israel remains the Mideast's only nuclear-armed state, an advantage it would like to keep.",
      "With Netanyahu's strong encouragement, Trump backed out of the deal struck by Obama. And since returning to the White House, Trump has given Israel free rein in its war against Hamas in Gaza, been soft on the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory and launched strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked Israel since the start of the war.",
      "But now that the U.S. has returned to the negotiating table with Iran, Netanyahu would risk jeopardizing his good ties with the president if he were to publicly oppose one of his administration\u2019s key foreign policy initiatives.",
      "The last time Netanyahu crossed the temperamental Trump was when he congratulated Joe Biden for his election win in 2020. Trump was apparently offended by the perceived disloyalty, and their ties went into deep freeze.",
      "Israel is communicating to Washington its priorities for any deal. As part of that, it understood that should Israel choose to carry out a strike on Iran, it would likely be doing so alone \u2014 so long as negotiations were underway, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.",
      "In a speech in Jerusalem this week, Netanyahu said he had discussed his terms for a deal with Trump. He explained that it would need to dismantle all the infrastructure of Iran's nuclear program and that it should work to prevent Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering a bomb.",
      "\"I said to President Trump that I hope that this is what the negotiators will do. We\u2019re in close contact with the United States. But I said one way or the other \u2013 Iran will not have nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu has said he would favor a strict diplomatic agreement similar to Libya\u2019s deal in 2003 to destroy its nuclear facilities and allow inspectors unfettered access. However, it is not clear if Trump will set such strict conditions \u2014 and Iran has rejected giving up its right to enrich.",
      "The Trump-led talks with Iran began earlier this month and have advanced to expert discussions over how to rein in Iran's nuclear program and prevent it from being able to obtain atomic weapons, should it choose to pursue them. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, though some officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb.",
      "While Trump has said a military option remains on the table, and has moved military assets to the region, he says he prefers a diplomatic solution. Planned talks between Iran and the United States this weekend were postponed on Thursday.",
      "Since Trump scrapped the Obama-era agreement in 2018, Iran has ramped up its nuclear enrichment and increased its uranium stockpile.",
      "Netanyahu's 2015 speech to Congress against Obama's deal \u2014 at the invitation of Republicans \u2014 was made without consulting the White House. Obama did not attend.",
      "That was just one of many instances in which Netanyahu was seen as cozying up to Republicans, driving a wedge in what has traditionally been bipartisan support for Israel. That, coupled with Netanyahu's strained relationship with the Biden administration over Israel's conduct in Gaza, has meant that Netanyahu can't rely on Democratic allies to take up his cause.",
      "Still, Netanyahu would struggle to find any Republicans willing to publicly confront the president on this issue. And he himself will struggle to criticize a deal if one is clinched; instead, he might send surrogates like his far-right allies to do so, said Gilboa of Bar-Ilan University.",
      "But until then, Gilboa said, Netanyahu's best hope is that the talks fail.",
      "\u201cThat, for him, will be the best case scenario.\u201d",

      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro is pressing on his struggling plan to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Thursday pressed on with his struggling plan to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws, sending Congress a referendum proposal whose questions for voters include whether workdays should be limited to eight hours and whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays.",
      "With much of his agenda repeatedly blocked by Congress, Petro is now betting that the same lawmakers who twice rejected his labor reform will allow voters to decide whether they want his proposed changes. Congress has one month to approve or reject the 12-question referendum.",
      "Petro, Colombia\u2019s first ever leftist president, sought to rally support for his project by participating in a union demonstration in the capital, Bogota, marking Labor Day.",
      "\u201cThe people of Colombia want to vote for their fundamental rights, for their dignity,\" Petro said before thousands of demonstrators, asking them to not vote to reelect any lawmaker who votes against the referendum.",
      "If approved by lawmakers, Petro will have to issue a decree summoning Colombians to the polls within three months. Questions for voters would include whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m. and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "But overcoming Congress is not Petro\u2019s only concern in seeing his project become a reality. He needs referendum participation to exceed 13 million \u2013 that\u2019s more than the number of votes he obtained to become president \u2013 and more than half of those votes must be in favor of his proposal.",
      "Analysts agree that Petro has the upper hand in several scenarios, even if Congress does not approve the referendum or if he fails to obtain the necessary votes at the polls. In the former scenario, Sandra Borda, political science professor at the University of the Andes, said lawmakers would give Petro\u2019s government the tools to \u201cplay the victim\u201d and strengthen its rhetoric against Congress.",
      "\u201cThe message the government has constantly tried to send is that Congress is no longer an entity that represents the interests of the people... but rather defends the interests, as they call them, of the private sector oligarchies,\u201d Borda said.",
      "On the other hand, if voters end up going to the polls, the government could consider itself the winner by securing support from its electoral base, said Javier Garay, a political science professor at the Externship University of Colombia. He noted that the referendum\u2019s underlying purpose is to test the government\u2019s electoral support ahead of the 2026 presidential election.",
      "Union members who were among the thousands of people demonstrating Thursday in Bogota expressed support for the referendum.",
      "\u201cThe referendum is a vindication of workers\u2019 rights, which have been a struggle for decades and were taken away from us by previous far-right governments,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Parra, 53, one of the protesters.",

      "Prosecutors in Thailand say they don't intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation",
      "BANGKOK -- State prosecutors in Thailand announced Thursday that they don't intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.",
      "The arrest last month of Paul Chambers, a political science lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, had drawn concern from the academic community, especially from Asian studies scholars around the world, as well as the U.S. government",
      "The decision not to prosecute the 58-year-old Oklahoma native doesn't immediately clear him of the charge of insulting the monarchy\u2014 also known as \u201cl\u00e8se majest\u00e9\u201d \u2014 or a related charge of violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activities.",
      "The announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.",
      "Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, was arrested in early April on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command.",
      "He has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.",
      "Chambers\u2019 supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, wasn't written by him.",
      "He had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.",
      "Chambers\u2019 visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. It wasn't immediately clear whether the revocation will stand.",
      "\u201cThis case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\u201d a U.S. State Department statement said after Chambers' arrest. \u201dWe continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\u201d",
      "Thailand\u2019s l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law calls for three to 15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it's among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.",
      "That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the law.",

      "Television footage showed ambulances parked on a narrow back street with medics giving first aid to the children.",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Sister Inah Canabarro, a Brazilian nun and teacher who was the world's oldest person, died on Wednesday just weeks short of turning 117, her religious congregation said.",
      "Canabarro died at home of natural causes, said her Teresian nun congregation, the Company of Saint Teresa of Jesus. She was confirmed in January as the world\u2019s oldest person by LongeviQuest, an organization that tracks supercentenarians around the globe.",
      "She would have turned 117 on May 27. According to LongeviQuest, the world\u2019s oldest person is now Ethel Caterham, a 115-year-old British woman.",
      "Canabarro said her Catholic faith was the key to her longevity, in a video taken by LongeviQuest in February 2024. The smiling Canabarro can be seen cracking jokes, sharing miniature paintings she used to make of wild flowers and reciting the Hail Mary prayer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m young, pretty and friendly \u2014 all very good, positive qualities that you have too,\u201d the Teresian nun told the visitors to her retirement home in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre.",
      "As a child, Sister Inah Canabarro was so skinny that many people didn\u2019t think she would survive into adulthood, Cleber Canabarro, her 84-year-old nephew, told The Associated Press in January,",
      "Her great-grandfather was a famed Brazilian general who took up arms during the turbulent period following Brazil\u2019s independence from Portugal in the 19th century.",
      "She took up religious work while she was a teenager and spent two years in Montevideo, Uruguay, before moving to Rio de Janeiro and eventually settling in her home state of Rio Grande do Sul. A lifelong teacher, among her former students was Gen. Joao Figueiredo, the last of the military dictators who governed Brazil between 1964 and 1985. She was also the beloved creator of two marching bands at schools in sister cities straddling the border between Uruguay and Brazil.",
      "For her 110th birthday, she was honored by Pope Francis. She was the second oldest nun ever documented, after Lucile Randon, who was the world\u2019s oldest person until her death in 2023 at the age of 118.",
      "Canabarro took the title of the oldest living person following the death of Japan\u2019s Tomiko Itooka in December, according to LongeviQuest. She ranked as the 20th oldest documented person to have ever lived, a list topped by Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122, according to LongeviQuest.",
      "\u201cHer long and meaningful life touched many, and her legacy as a devoted educator, religious sister, and a supercentenarian will be remembered with great admiration,\u201d LongeviQuest said in a statement.",
      "The wake for Canabarro will take place on Thursday in Porto Alegre, the capital of southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, her order said.",

      "It was unclear how Trump would implement such a ban as he threatened to levy secondary sanctions on nations that import Iranian oil. But his statement risked further escalating tensions with China \u2014 Iran\u2019s leading customer \u2014 at a time when the relationship is severely strained over the U.S. president\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Based on tanker tracking data, the U.S. Energy Information Administration concluded in a report published last October that \u201cChina took nearly 90% of Iran\u2019s crude oil and condensate exports in 2023.\u201d Trump has separately placed 145% tariffs on China as a way to raise federal revenues and rebalance global trade.",

      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on a half-century of enmity. The negotiations have been led by Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "The U.S. president with his threat on social media would be going after Iran's major economic resource. It produced an average of 2.9 million barrels a day in 2023 of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran\u2019s program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. continues an airstrike campaign, called \u201cOperation Rough Rider,\u201d that has been targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels, who long have been backed by Iran. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth early Thursday warned Iran over the rebels.",

      "Facing overwhelming loss and the chaos that comes with sudden displacement, those looking to rebuild must navigate an often confusing and time-consuming process. In most cases, it will take years for them to rebuild.",
      "LA issued its first building permit nearly two months after the fires started. It took more than seven months before the first building permit was issued following the Woolsey Fire in 2018.",
      "\u201cPutting this in context of other disasters, the speed is actually probably faster than expected,\u201d said Sara McTarnaghan, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studied the aftermath of urban wildfires in recent years in Colorado, Hawaii and California.",
      "Kathryn Frazier, a music publicist and life coach, had lived in her four-bedroom, three-bath house in Altadena for 10 years and raised her two children there. After her home burned to the ground, she was in shock and questioned whether it made sense to come back.",
      "But after conversations with neighbors, she became determined to rebuild.",
      "\"I\u2019m not leaving,\" Frazier said. \"That\u2019s what kept coming up for everybody, and the more we all talked to each other the more we were all like \u2018hell yes.\u2019\u201d",
      "She is making progress. Frazier hired a crew to clear the property of debris and she is nearly through the first phase of permitting, which involves getting county review and approval for her new home's design. The next phase before receiving approval to begin construction includes reviews of electrical, plumbing and other aspects of the design.",
      "Frazier, 55, is rebuilding her home without major changes to its size or location in order to qualify for an expedited building permit approval process.",
      "\u201cWe are hoping to be building by June or July, latest,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that maybe by February or March of 2026 we could be back in our home.\"",
      "For now, Frazier is getting quotes on windows, skylights and other home fixtures in hopes of locking in prices before they go up as more construction projects ramp up, or in response to the Trump administration's ongoing trade war.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing things like scouring Home Depot, finding slate tiles that look modern and beautiful, but they\u2019re actually really cheap,\" she said.",
      "DeAnn Heline, a TV showrunner, knows what it\u2019s like to build her dream house from the ground up.",
      "She waited more than two years for construction to be completed on the five-bedroom, eight-bath home with ocean views. Once the project was done, her husband vowed to never build another house. The family lived there for six years before it was destroyed in the Palisades Fire.",
      "\u201cIt was ash. There was nothing,\u201d Heline said.",
      "The couple, who have two daughters, have lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years. They couldn\u2019t imagine giving up and not rebuilding.",
      "\u201cNot only are we building another house, we\u2019re building the exact same house again,\u201d Heline said, noting the new home will have some upgrades including fire-resistant materials and sprinklers for the exterior of the house.",
      "Recently, they cleared debris from the land where the house once stood, a particularly onerous task because the home featured a large basement into which much of the structure collapsed as it burned.",
      "Heline isn't sure when construction will begin, but figures it could be two or three years. She wonders, however, what the neighborhood will look like by then.",
      "\u201cWhat are you going back to? You\u2019re going back to a moonscape? Are you there and no one else is on your block, or are you going back to a construction zone for many more years?\" she said.",
      "The Eaton wildfire destroyed many of the more than 270 historic Janes Cottages in Altadena, including the three-bedroom home Tim Vordtriede shared with his wife and two young children.",
      "The family had only lived in the roughly 100-year-old house for three years.",
      "\u201cWe just loved the storybook cottage and the vibe, and of course the grander vibe of Altadena,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect.\u201d",
      "Vordtriede, 44, has decided to rebuild, but not just yet. For now, he is using his experience as a construction project manager to help others who also lost their homes.",
      "He co-founded Altadena Collective, a group providing assistance with home designs and guidance on how to navigate the complex and lengthy approval process for rebuilding permits. Of the roughly two dozen clients that the group is serving, at reduced cost, three are in the early stages of the permitting process.",
      "Even after projects reach shovel-ready status, homeowners will have to wait perhaps more than a year before they can move in, he said.",
      "\u201cMy first statement when anyone walks in the door is: We\u2019re not here to help you design your dream home,\u201d Vordtriede said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream time. This is a nightmare, and our job is to get you out of the nightmare as soon as possible.\u201d",

    "summary": "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Republican-controlled U.S. House voted Thursday to block California from enforcing first-in-the-nation rules phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The move comes a day after the chamber voted to halt California standards to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "\u201cThe passage of these resolutions is a victory for Americans who will not be forced into purchasing costly EVs because of California\u2019s unworkable mandates,\u201d House Republicans Brett Guthrie of Kentucky and Morgan Griffith of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cIf not repealed, the California waivers would lead to higher prices for both new and used vehicles, increase our reliance on China, and strain our electric grid.\u201d",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government's. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 announced plans to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035, as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "State regulators then formalized the rules, some other states announced plans to follow them, and the Biden administration approved the state's waiver to implement them in December, a month before President Donald Trump returned to office.",
      "This week's House votes fell largely along party lines, though some Democrats joined Republicans to advance them. That would be against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, who sides with the U.S. General Accountability Office in saying California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",
      "Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "But the California standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, wrote in a letter to Congress in March.",
      "Newsom said the effort is another signal of Republicans' ideological shift over the decades from an era in which former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan signed landmark environmental laws to one in which Trump is pushing for environmental rollbacks on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change.",
      "\u201cClean air didn\u2019t used to be political,\" Newsom said in a statement. \u201cOur vehicles program helps clean the air for all Californians, and we\u2019ll continue defending it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which passed the vehicle emission standards, said the agency \u201cwill continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.\u201d",
      "It is unclear what will happen in the Senate. The Senate Parliamentarian in April reaffirmed the GAO\u2019s findings that California\u2019s Clean Air Act waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, according to California Sen. Adam Schiff's office.",
      "\u201cWe will fight this latest attack on California\u2019s power to protect its own residents, and I will urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the severe implications of proceeding with this violation of states\u2019 rights, as well as the dangerous precedent it would set by flouting the unanimous opinion of Congress\u2019 trusted arbiters,\" the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, called the use of the Congressional Review Act a \u201cbackdoor move\u201d that \u201cshows just how recklessly Republicans behave.\u201d",
      "\"Republicans may regret opening this Pandora\u2019s box, inviting attacks on many other non-rules in the future when they\u2019re no longer in charge,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "But the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers applauded Thursday's vote, calling it a \u201chuge win for U.S. consumers.\"",
      "\"California\u2019s unlawful ban should never have been authorized, and Governor Newsom should never have been allowed to seize this much control over the American vehicle market,\u201d Mike Sommers, the institute's president and CEO, and Chet Thompson, the manufacturers group's president and CEO, said in a joint statement.",

      "The bill now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis for final approval, and his office hasn't said if he'll sign it. The Republican governor distanced himself from the proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land. DeSantis leads and appoints the heads of all state agencies.",
      "The issue created a dilemma for Republican lawmakers who have traditionally defended the governor\u2019s administration, and increased scrutiny of DeSantis' record on environmental conservation.",
      "Protections for state parks are reflected \u201cloud and clear\u201d in the bill, said state Rep. John Snyder.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve put real plans in place to make sure that, for generations to come, our state parks will be preserved,\u201d said Snyder, who represents a district about an hour north of Palm Beach. He noted the parks are enjoyed by millions of residents and tourists alike.",
      "The bill doesn\u2019t ban all types of development. But any projects must be \u201cconservation-based recreational uses\u201d that support things like hiking, swimming, horseback riding, boating, studying nature and other similar activities, according to a House staff analysis.",
      "Snyder said the bill's language was strengthened by an amendment proposed in the Senate, which also added a name change for a state park in Tallahassee.",
      "The public first got wind that DeSantis' environmental agency was looking for recreational development plans in state parks when the Great Outdoors Initiative was leaked last August. Hundreds of people protested at parks and the state's environmental protection headquarters, waving signs like \u201cParks Over Profit\u201d and \u201cSave Don\u2019t Pave.\u201d",
      "Before the month was over, the governor said the Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s plans were \u201cgoing back to the drawing board.\u201d",
      "The environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intensified scrutiny and bipartisan criticism of the initiative. In November, DeSantis appointed a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",

      "Eli Lilly's stock wobbled Thursday after a looming coverage hit was detailed for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound.",
      "CVS Health said the drugs Wegovy and Saxenda from rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk will become the preferred options on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.",
      "This could complicate access to a drug that many patients cannot afford to pay for on their own.",
      "The formulary is maintained by CVS Health\u2019s pharmacy benefits management business, which runs prescription drug coverage for millions of people. Employers and insurers \u2014 who pay most of the prescription bill \u2014 use the formulary to decide which drugs get coverage.",
      "They can customize their coverage plans to include Zepbound. But CVS Health spokesman David Whitrap said most employers wind up using the standard formulary because of the discounts negotiated for them.",
      "Patients taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy if the Lilly drug is excluded from their coverage, Whitrap said.",
      "CVS Health also said Thursday that it will start selling Wegovy at a discounted price of about $500 monthly at thousands of drugstores for people without coverage. Novo had announced its new lower price last month.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity due to the amount of weight people lose while taking the injections. Coverage of these drugs has been patchy due to in part to their cost and the wide swath of patients who could take them.",
      "Shortages of the drugs also have made access challenging, but those have eased recently. That allows pharmacy benefit managers to pit the products against each other to negotiate lower prices in exchange for inclusion on a formulary.",
      "Lilly may have to make some price cuts to restore formulary access, said Daniel Barasa, who follows the company for Gabelli Funds. But he said he thinks big employers will still include both treatments on their lists of covered drugs, leaving the choice on what to use up to patients and doctors.",

      "Zepbound has emerged as one of Lilly's top sellers. Its sales jumped to $2.3 billion in the recently completed first quarter. That\u2019s up from $517 million a year ago, during the drug\u2019s first full quarter on the market.",

      "The news comes nearly four months after Buchanan, who had been previously the CEO of arts and crafts chain Michaels, took over the job on January 15. Buchanan\u2019s appointment marks the third CEO for Kohl\u2019s in three years as the department store struggles to reverse sluggish sales.",
      "Kohl's said Thursday that Buchanan\u2019s firing is unrelated to its performance, financial reporting, results of operations and did not involve any of its other employees.",
      "Kohl\u2019s will conduct a search for a permanent CEO and said it will name a new chair in due course. The company couldn't be immediately be reached for comment. Buchanan didn't immediately return a message sent to his Linkedin account.",
      "According to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Buchanan's termination follows a probe conducted by outside counsel and overseen by the board's audit committee. It found Buchanan had directed that Kohl's conduct business with a vendor founded by an individual with whom Buchanan has a personal relationship on \u201chighly unusual terms favorable to the vendor\u201d and that he also caused Kohl's to enter into a multimillion-dollar consulting agreement with the same individual who was a part of the consulting team.",
      "It also found that in neither case did Buchanan disclose this relationship as required under Kohl's code of ethics.",
      "In connection with his termination and in accordance with the terms of his equity award agreements, Buchanan will forfeit all equity awards he received from the company, including the recruitment awards made as of January 15, according to the filing. Buchanan will also be required to reimburse Kohl\u2019s for a pro rata portion of his signing incentive in the amount of $2.5 million, according to the documents.",
      "As a result of Buchanan\u2019s termination, the board has determined to withdraw his nomination for election as a director of the company at the company's annual shareholders' meeting to be held on May 14.",
      "Buchanan had succeeded Tom Kingsbury, who stayed on as an adviser and is retaining his position on Kohl\u2019s board until his retirement next month. Kingsbury served as Kohl\u2019s interim CEO in December 2022 and was named its permanent leader in February 2023.",
      "The firing comes at a time when Kohl's, which operates 1,600 stores across the country, is wrestling with sluggish sales. Its middle income shoppers have pulled back on discretionary spending in the face of still-high prices for necessities. It's also faced stiff competition from Walmart and Amazon, which have been improving their fashion offerings at affordable prices.",
      "And like other retailers, it is confronting uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, Kohl's offered a preliminary look at sales and profits for the current quarter that showed continued weakness, though the expected results are on track to beat Wall Street estimates. It said that it expects to report a decline in comparable sales \u2014 those coming from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 in the range of 4.3% to 4%, and a loss of 24 cents to 20 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter.",
      "Analysts expected earnings per share loss of 54 cents and a drop in comparable sales of 6.4%, according to FactSet.",
      "It expects to report final fiscal first-quarter results on May 29.",
      "Shares of the company, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, rose nearly 9% in late morning trading.",

      "Activists around the globe are kicking off May Day demonstrations with workers rights rallies and marches for social justice causes",
      "CHICAGO -- From worker rights rallies to marches for social justice, activists around the globe will kick off May Day demonstrations on Thursday.",
      "In some countries, it\u2019s a public holiday honoring labor, but activists planning marches in the United States say much of their message is about fighting back against President Donald Trump\u2019s policies targeting immigrants, federal workers and diversity programs.",
      "Thousands are expected at demonstrations from Tokyo to Chicago. In some parts of the U.S., though, fear sowed by the Trump administration is expected to keep some immigrants home.",
      "\u201cEverybody is under attack right now,\u201d said Jorge Mujica, a longtime labor leader from Chicago, where May Day rallies historically have had a large turnout.",
      "The roots of May Day, or International Workers Day, stretch back over a century to a turbulent and pivotal time in U.S. labor history.",
      "In the 1880s, unions pushing for better workplace conditions began advocating for an eight-hour workday with widespread demonstrations and strikes. In May 1886, a Chicago labor rally turned deadly when a bomb was thrown and police retaliated with gunfire. Several labor activists, most of them immigrants, were convicted of conspiracy to incite violence among other charges. Four were hanged.",
      "Unions later recommended that the workers be honored every May 1. A sculpture in Chicago's Haymarket Square commemorates them with an inscription that reads: \u201cDedicated to all workers of the world.\u201d",
      "May Day marches, rallies and riots have taken place worldwide in recent years as unions push for better rights for workers, groups air economic grievances or activists call for an end to the war in Gaza.",
      "While most demonstrations have been peaceful, there have been clashes with police.",
      "Last year, police in Paris fired tear gas as thousands of protesters marched through the French capital, seeking better pay and working conditions. In New York City, May Day demonstrations coincided with rising tensions at college campuses over pro-Palestinian student encampments, resulting in numerous arrests.",
      "This year, organizers in numerous cities, including New York, are calling for unity across many causes and groups.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re organizing for a world where every family has housing, health care, fair wages, union protection, and safety \u2014 regardless of race, immigration status, or zip code,\u201d the American Civil Liberty Union of New York said in a statement.",
      "Other notable U.S. demonstrations include a workers rally at Philadelphia City Hall with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and demonstrations at the Colorado State Capitol and in Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington, D.C.",
      "While labor and immigrant rights are historically intertwined, the focus of May Day rallies in the U.S. shifted to immigration in 2006. That\u2019s when roughly 1 million people, including nearly half a million in Chicago alone, took to the streets to protest federal legislation that would\u2019ve made living in the U.S. without legal permission a felony.",
      "Crowds for May 1 demonstrations have since dwindled with advocacy groups splintering and shifting activism arenas such as voters rights.",
      "This year in Chicago, organizers say activism starting Thursday will last until Cinco de Mayo with boycotts and walkouts. Their focus is workers' rights but also rising anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump's administration.",
      "Organizers acknowledge a chilling effect on immigrant communities since Trump has cracked down on enforcement, especially in so-called sanctuary cities including Chicago. They\u2019re expecting lower numbers of immigrants but are expanding their outreach to more unions, including for teachers and nurses.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot fear out there,\u201d said Omar Lopez, a longtime Chicago organizer.",
      "In some countries, May Day is a public holiday for workers, including France, Kenya, Russia and China, where it lasts five days.",
      "It\u2019s also a traditional spring celebration that\u2019s observed in ways that don\u2019t involve marching in the streets or civil disobedience.",
      "In Hawaii, May 1 is called Lei Day, which isn\u2019t an official holiday, but a statewide celebration of the Hawaiian culture and the aloha spirit through the creation and giving of lei \u2014 usually a necklace of flowers.",
      "Elsewhere, people mark the holiday by leaving May Day baskets filled with gifts and flowers on the doorsteps of friends. The city of Annapolis, Maryland, is set to hold its 70th May Day Basket Competition, where residents and businesses outdo each other for the best floral arrangements.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our community\u2019s way of saying goodbye to winter and welcoming the beauty and energy of spring,\u201d Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley said.",

      "The Trump administration is ending a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday.",
      "The expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the U.S. every day \u2014 mostly from China \u2014 is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down.",
      "But some might actually benefit from the termination of the duty exemption. For instance, companies that make their goods in the U.S. may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook.",
      "The move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump's new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on the U.S., fueling a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Sellers are already seeing cautious consumers.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called the de minimis exemption \u201ca big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe put an end to it,\u201d he said.",
      "Introduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold rose to $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can\u2019t avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the U.S. was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the deluge of parcels coming in.",
      "Consumers will face higher prices and delivery delays now that parcels will go through a more complicated customs process to enter the U.S. involving declaration and duty payment.",
      "Businesses could factor tariffs into the final price, or they can list them separately in the same way as sales taxes. For instance, Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, now lists \u201cimport charges\u201d that have reportedly doubled many items\u2019 prices. (The retailer also has a \u201clocal warehouse\u201d option for some products, which are shipped from within the U.S. and therefore avoids the import charge.)",
      "Meanwhile, Shein, now based in Singapore, has a checkout banner that reads, \u201cTariffs are included in the price you pay. You\u2019ll never have to pay extra at delivery.\u201d",
      "Amazon says it\u2019s not planning to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its site \u2014 despite a report that sparked speculation the e-commerce giant would soon show the new import charges, and the White House has made fiery comments denouncing the purported change.",
      "Parcel carriers will be burdened with collecting duties, and the paperwork to comply with the new rule could result not only in higher prices but also delays and even disruptions to delivery, said Ram Ben Tzion of the vetting platform Publican.",
      "Major commercial carriers such as UPS and FedEx have said they are well-equipped and prepared to collect duties on international parcels in compliance with local laws, including the new U.S. rule.",
      "Commercial carriers will be collecting 145% tariffs on declared values. The U.S. Postal Service, a government agency that offers international mail service, can choose either to charge a 120% tariff on low-value packages or a flat fee of $100 per shipment, which is set to rise to $200 on June 1.",
      "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it \"stands ready to fully implement the restrictions on de minimis shipments and collect all revenue owed for these shipments on May 2, 2025.\u201d",
      "However, experts have expressed concerns that the surge in the workload could be a serious challenge.",
      "In January and February, more than 70% of the 216 million packages coming into the U.S. were originating from China, according to CBP.",
      "Those that relied on the de minimis exemption are now having to adjust.",
      "John Curry, owner and chief executive officer of HAPARI International, an Arizona-based swimwear business, had switched from bulk shipping to de minimis shipping about six months ago to improve cash flow, speed up delivery, and eventually eliminate U.S.-based warehousing. His company makes its products in China and sells them directly to U.S. customers via its own online storefront.",
      "Curry said he planned to stay the course and pay the additional 145% duty \u2014 one parcel at a time \u2014 while waiting for the U.S. and China to work out a more sustainable approach.",
      "\u201cThere has to be a solution because both countries cannot survive this way,\u201d Curry said.",
      "Izzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, helps businesses like HAPARI to ship goods from its China-based warehouse using the de minimis exemption. He says U.S. businesses are likely to stay in China for now given the competitiveness of the manufacturing base and of the supply chain in China but can be expected to raise prices.",
      "And while businesses with good profit margins probably will continue to ship from China, those that run on razor-thin profit margins are likely to \u201cgo local\u201d, setting up more U.S.-based warehouses to defray tariff costs, he said.",
      "Trade groups representing flag manufacturers and bike dealers said they expect to benefit from the end of the duty exemption.",
      "In written comments on the U.S. Trade Representative portal, for instance, the Flag Manufacturers Association of America said its members have been bombarded by an onslaught of American flag imports mostly made in China that are falsely marketed and significantly discounted. The group cited a drop of 25% to 35% in industrywide sales of American-made U.S. flags last year.",
      "Larry Severini, CEO of Embroidery Solutions Manufacturing LLC, which makes the star fields for U.S. flag manufacturers, had to shutter one of his two plants in South Carolina earlier this year because of stiff competition from cheap imports. He noted sales have fallen 20% since 2021 in part because of the de minimis exemption.",
      "\u201cWe need duties to level the playing field to make it fair,\u201d Severini said.",
      "The National Bike Dealers' Association's Heather Mason said shoppers often check out $2,000 bike from a trusted brand like Trek and then they find a lookalike online for $1,200 \u2014 often with lower quality parts, no warranty, no service, and safety risks.",
      "\u201cReputable brands follow strict safety, labor, and warranty standards,\u201d she said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cDe minimis allowed bad actors to dodge these.\"",

      "Senate Democrats are forcing a vote on whether to block global tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier this month",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are forcing a vote Wednesday evening on whether to block global tariffs announced by Donald Trump earlier this month, a potentially tough vote for some Republicans who have expressed concerns about the policy but are wary of crossing the president.",
      "Trump announced the far-reaching tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners April 2 and then reversed himself a few days later after a market meltdown, suspending the import taxes for 90 days. Amid the uncertainty for both U.S. consumers and businesses, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank 0.3% from January through March, the first drop in three years.",
      "It is unclear whether the resolution will pass the Senate, and House passage is even less likely. But Democrats say they want to put Republicans on the record either way and try to reassert congressional powers.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cannot be an idle spectator in the tariff madness,\u201d said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the lead sponsor of the resolution.",
      "All 47 Senate Democrats are expected to support the resolution, which means they would need four Republican votes for passage. A similar resolution that would have thwarted Trump\u2019s ability to impose tariffs on Canada passed the Senate earlier this month with the support of Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. All but McConnell have indicated that they will vote for the broader resolution Wednesday.",
      "Wary of a rebuke to Trump, Republican leaders have encouraged their conference not to vote for the resolution, even as many of them remain wary of the tariffs. Vice President JD Vance attended a Senate GOP luncheon Tuesday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who assured senators that the administration is working on trade deals with individual countries.",
      "Republicans who have been skeptical of the tariffs said they won\u2019t vote with Democrats, arguing it is a political stunt. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he backs separate legislation by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley that would give Congress increased power over determining tariffs but would vote no on the resolution, which he said is only about \u201cmaking a point.\u201d",
      "Democrats say the Republicans\u2019 failure to stand up to Trump could have dire consequences. \u201cThe only thing Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have succeeded in is raising the odds of recession and sending markets into a tailspin,\u201d said Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cToday, they have to choose \u2013 stick with Trump or stand with your states.\u201d",
      "The Democratic resolution forces a vote under a statute that allows them to try to terminate the emergency that Trump declared in order to put the tariffs in place.",
      "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called it a \u201cfake\u201d emergency that Trump is using to impose his \u201con again, off again, red light, green light tariffs.\u201d",
      "The tariffs \u201care pushing our economy off a cliff,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The Republican president has tried to reassure a nervous country that his tariffs will not provoke a recession as his administration has focused on China. He told his Cabinet Wednesday morning that his tariffs meant China was \u201chaving tremendous difficulty because their factories are not doing business.\u201d",
      "Trump said the U.S. does not really need imports from the world\u2019s dominant manufacturer. \u201cMaybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.\u201d",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Ford Motor Company's top executive on Wednesday welcomed revisions to auto import rules but said more work is needed to craft trade policies that spur growth in the U.S. auto industry.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley touted his company's domestic production, saying it outpaces competitors, as he attended the rollout of the company's 2025 Expedition SUV at its massive truck plant in Kentucky.",
      "Farley focused on trade policies during his remarks to plant workers, a day after President Donald Trump signed executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.",
      "\u201cThe changes this week on tariff plans will help ease the impact of tariffs for automakers, suppliers and consumers,\u201d Farley said. \u201cBut this is what we really care about. We need to continue to work closely with the administration on a comprehensive set of policies to support our shared vision of that healthy and growing auto industry. And we are not there yet.\u201d",
      "Farley pointed to Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, which employs nearly 9,000 workers, as \u201ca shining example of American manufacturing.\u201d Ford has another auto production plant across town in Louisville. The venerable automaker opened the truck plant for a media tour Wednesday, showing off its synchronized assembly lines.",
      "Farley took aim at Ford's competitors in his speech, saying if they matched Ford's level of domestic production, it would be a boon for U.S. manufacturing and employment.",
      "\u201cMore than 80% of the vehicles Ford sells in America are assembled in America \u2014 plus we export significantly,\" he said. \"If each of our competitors matched that commitment, it would mean 4 million more vehicles assembled in America every single year.",
      "\u201cIf our competition matched Ford and moved auto assembly to the U.S., that would equal the production level of as many as 15 new assembly plants like this one \u2013 and that\u2019s not even counting the supplier parts to support them. That would mean hundreds of thousands of new jobs in America.\u201d",

      "Trump signed one order on Tuesday that amended his previous 25% auto tariffs, making it easier for vehicles that are assembled in the U.S. with foreign parts to avoid prohibitively high import taxes.",
      "The major car companies recently said sales rose sharply in March, with most reporting double-digit gains. For some companies, the strong performance helped make up for a sluggish start to the year. Some industry observers said the March numbers were expected to be higher due to some buying ahead of the anticipated imposition of tariffs.",
      "As discussions on trade and domestic production continue with Trump's administration, Farley called for policies that encourage exports and reward companies like Ford that export American-produced products.",
      "\u201cSo many of the vehicles we build here are exported around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we get credit for that? Those are American jobs. And we have to keep working on affordable parts to ensure that those supply chains promote domestic growth and affordable vehicles in our country.\u201d",
      "Ford also said Wednesday that it is extending its \u201cemployee pricing\u201d offer to vehicle buyers through the July 4th weekend. Farley said the offer has \u201cstruck a chord\u201d with consumers.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Kyle Busch was hyped for NASCAR greatness long before he was a teenager by his Hall of Fame nominee brother, who vowed \u201cif you think I\u2019m good, wait until you see my little brother.\u201d",
      "Busch's debut in a NASCAR national series race was delayed, though, when he turned up at California Speedway in 2001 intent to run the Truck Series race. He dominated practice in a race sponsored by Marlboro but, because he was only 16 at the time, was ruled ineligible to compete over NASCAR's interpretation of the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.",
      "The MSA prohibited individuals under 18 from participating in events sponsored by tobacco companies. And because NASCAR at the time was sponsored by Winston, the series eventually adopted its own rule six weeks later implementing a minimum age requirement of 18 that began in 2002.",
      "Busch had no choice but to move to the American Speed Association National Tour, and then ARCA after graduating early from his Las Vegas high school.",
      "Fast-forward to Friday when Busch celebrates his 40th birthday as a two-time Cup Series champion headed to Texas Motor Speedway with 232 national series victories. Kurt Busch, his older brother by seven years and a nominee last week to next year's Hall of Fame class, has one Cup title and 43 career national series victories.",
      "Busch can now laugh at his experience 24 years ago at California Speedway, where he went on to win five Cup races, including the last one in 2023 before the track was shuttered by NASCAR.",
      "\u201cShut that place down,\u201d he said, noting the irony that he's now sponsored by zone nicotine pouches, which has an additional relationship with online retailer Nicokick. \u201cFull circle moment.\u201d",
      "Busch celebrated his birthday early \u2014 over the Easter weekend, which was NASCAR's only break of the 38-race schedule \u2014 with a vacation with wife, Samantha. They left their two children home and Samantha made a heartfelt social media post honoring her husband.",
      "\u201cEarly celebration for Kyle\u2019s big 4-0, love ya babe,\u201d Samantha wrote, sharing a picture of herself and her husband at dinner on a beachfront. In a separate image, Kyle could also be seen with a small chocolate cake in front of him with a candle burning.",
      "Busch said he and Samantha \u201cmade the most of it\u201d even though he finds it difficult to unwind.",
      "\u201cJust a nice little quiet time, tried to disconnect, that's not easy for me to do,\u201d Busch said. \u201cSo I'm still kind of doing some work from afar, emails and things like that.\u201d",
      "And as for turning 40? Well, he wasn't exactly thrilled. Busch is in his 23rd season in the Cup Series, and although he joined Richard Childress Racing in 2023 and won three races, he went winless in Cup last year for the first time in his career and missed the playoffs. His losing streak headed to Texas is an eye-popping 67 races.",
      "\u201cI remember turning 30 and thinking that was going to be it,\u201d Busch said. \u201cIt is what it is. Samantha has made the best of that for me where we celebrated my birthday on that trip. I don't feel much older than I did five, six years ago. So that's the good part of it. And I'm in pretty decent shape, so thankful for all of that.\u201d",
      "Busch briefly considered retirement at the end of the 2022 season when he parted ways with Joe Gibbs Racing, where he for now is the winningest driver in team history with Denny Hamlin closing in on his mark. Now, he'd like to race at least until his son, Brexton, turns 18 and the two can compete against each other in NASCAR.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- With his team trailing by 27 points to the red-hot Houston Rockets at halftime, coach Steve Kerr pulled Golden State emotional leader Draymond Green aside for a quick chat and to ask his opinion.",
      "Should the Warriors plan to save their starters for what looked like an inevitable Game 6 in two days if things became any more out of hand after intermission? Green suggested Kerr should give the group five more minutes to see what could be done on the deficit.",
      "It only got worse. And Kerr sent in the backups with 5:50 left in the third quarter of an embarrassing 131-116 loss Wednesday night so his Warriors can turn their attention at trying again to close out the first-round series back home Friday night.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to chase this game obviously with Game 6 coming up in 48 hours,\" Kerr said. \"So I talked to Draymond.

And there\u2019s nothing to get worked up or get tight about. It\u2019s just understanding that you can\u2019t turn the ball over and you need possessions, we need good possessions.

      "What to Know: Foul trouble and free-throw differential have been common themes in this series, with Golden State the culprit in Game 5. The Warriors had 27 fouls and the Rockets converted 32 of 38 free throws \u2014 8 of 8 by Brooks, 6 of 6 by VanVleet, and 8 of 9 for Amen Thompson. The Rockets also played a clean game with just 12 turnovers while Kerr has stressed taking care of the ball so many time this season and the Warriors committed 15 turnovers for 20 Houston points. And Golden State's defense will have to do something different against VanVleet, who along with his fellow starters had to return to the game when the Warriors reserves made a run and finished with a playoff franchise-record 76 bench points. Kerr chose to keep his veteran stars of Butler, Curry and Green on the bench to end the game and get them ready for Friday.",

      "LONDON -- Transgender women will be banned from playing on women's soccer teams in England following a U.K. Supreme Court ruling last month, the sport's governing body said Thursday.",
      "The Football Association said it had decided to change its rules that had allowed transgender athletes to play on women's soccer if they had reduced testosterone levels. The Scottish Football Association made a similar decision last week.",
      "The U.K's highest court issued a ruling two weeks ago that defined a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female. The head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said after the ruling that transgender women would be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams.",

      "It was not clear how many players would be affected by the policy that would take effect June 1.",

      "LeBron James wasn\u2019t ready to make any decisions about his future in the painful moments immediately after his 22nd NBA season ended with the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 first-round playoff exit",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James wasn't ready to make any decisions about his future in the painful moments immediately after his 22nd NBA season ended with the Los Angeles Lakers' first-round playoff exit.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the answer to that,\u201d James said Wednesday night when asked how long he will continue to play. \u201cSomething I\u2019ll sit down with my wife and my support group and kind of just talk through it, and see what happens. Just have conversations with myself on how long I want to continue to play. I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now, to be honest.\u201d",
      "The 40-year-old James has given no public indication he is thinking about retirement this summer, but Lakers fans will be holding their breath until the top scorer in NBA history makes his plans official.",
      "James provided no hints after recording 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the Lakers' 103-96 loss to Minnesota.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to me if I\u2019m going to continue to play, or how long I\u2019m going to continue to play,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately up to me, so it has nothing to do with anybody else.\"",
      "Most observers think the four-time champion is planning to return for a 23rd season, which would break the NBA longevity record he currently shares with Vince Carter. He is also just 49 regular-season games behind Robert Parish, who holds the NBA record with 1,611 games played. James already holds the league record for career playoff games with 292.",
      "But his seventh season with the Lakers is over after the Timberwolves' 4-1 series victory. Los Angeles didn't build a winning dynamic quickly enough to the midseason arrival of Luka Doncic in a seismic trade for Anthony Davis.",
      "James' Lakers have advanced in the postseason just once in the five years since their championship in the Florida bubble \u2014 but if James returns, he's coming back to a completely reconfigured team built around his new partnership with Doncic.",
      "James and Doncic played only 21 games together after the deal, and it wasn't enough to maximize their potential teamwork. Another full year together could raise their partnership to formidable levels, and James still seems intrigued by the prospect of playing a full year or more alongside the Slovenian superstar he has described as his favorite active player.",
      "\u201cAnytime you make a big acquisition in the middle of the season, it\u2019s always going to be challenging, not only for me, but for (Austin Reaves) and the rest of the group,\u201d James said. \u201cThere were times where we obviously didn\u2019t look so well, but I think we kind of figured it out later in the season, the more games we had. I still don\u2019t think we had enough time to mesh, but for the time that we had, I thought we ended the regular season very well to be top three in the West.\u201d",
      "Doncic isn't the only teammate who could compel James to return: His 20-year-old son, Bronny, is coming off a surprisingly solid rookie season with the Lakers in which they became the first father and son to play together in NBA history.",
      "Bronny James is hoping to carve out a bigger role alongside his father next season after getting sporadic playing time this year. LeBron said the chance to work alongside Bronny this season was the \u201cNo. 1\u201d accomplishment of his career.",
      "There are no apparent contractual or financial issues in James' way: He has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. That\u2019s serious money to leave on the table, even for a business mogul with a net worth estimated at more than $1 billion.",
      "An eighth consecutive season with the Lakers would be the longest stretch of his career with one team, surpassing his first seven seasons with Cleveland \u2014 although he returned for four more years and a championship with the Cavaliers.",
      "James' level of play remained high in his 22nd season, confounding all previous notions of basketball longevity. He averaged 24.4 points per game \u2014 his lowest since his rookie season, but just barely \u2014 along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds.",
      "James remained the Lakers' heart while they won 52 games and the Pacific Division title despite the midseason roster upheaval. Every significant contributor on this season's roster is under contract for 2025-26 except for Dorian Finney-Smith, who has a $15.3 million player option, and inconsistent center Jaxson Hayes.",
      "In a moment of reflection near his 40th birthday last December, James speculated that he could continue to play at this level for five to seven more years. He doesn't intend to stick around that long, however.",

      "The Mercury had a good run with Taurasi and Griner.",
      "Taurasi staked her claim as one of the greatest players in women's basketball history since the Mercury selected her with the No. 1 overall pick of the 2004 WNBA draft. In the 20 years that followed, she racked up six Olympic gold medals, three league championships and numerous records before calling it a career earlier this year.",
      "The 6-foot-9 Griner was a force during her 11-year stay in the desert, throwing down dunks and swatting shots like no other player while helping the Mercury win their most recent championship, in 2014. She opted to test free agency and signed a one-year contract with the Dream, hoping to set herself up for a bigger contract when the league's new collective bargaining deal is in place next year.",
      "Those are two big holes to fill, but general manager Nick U\u2019Ren already had the wheels in motion to start the Mercury's new era.",
      "Phoenix first acquired Thomas in a trade with Connecticut, adding a veteran do-everything forward who's the WNBA\u2019s career leader with 15 triple-doubles. The 6-2 forward played her entire 11-year career with the Sun, leading them to the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022, and earned a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.",
      "With Taurasi's retirement looming, Phoenix pulled off a three-way trade that brought Sabally to the desert. The 6-4 forward was an All-WNBA first-teamer in 2023, then averaged 17.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists in a 2024 season limited to 15 games because of a shoulder injury.",

      "Rounding out Phoenix's new Big Three is Kahleah Copper, a dynamic scorer and leader.",
      "The 6-1 small forward was a three-time All-Star with Chicago before being traded to Phoenix, where she had a massive impact in just one season.",

      "Now that Taurasi and Griner are gone, Copper fully will take the reigns as the team's leader, pushing teammates new and old to continue the Mercury's long history of winning.",

      "The Mercury had no choice but to take a new direction with Taurasi and Griner gone. They're hoping the new core can lead the franchise along the same winning direction.",

      "North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick defended girlfriend Jordon Hudson for interjecting during a CBS interviewer's questions about their relationship and said she was \u201csimply doing her job.\"",
      "The six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach and first-time college coach at UNC issued a statement through the school Wednesday, which followed an appearance on \u201cCBS News Sunday Morning\u201d to promote his upcoming book on his coaching life. In the interview, Hudson objected to a question about how the two had met while Tony Dokoupil referred to her during the segment as being a \u201cconstant presence\u201d in the interview.",
      "\u201cThe final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation which we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career,\u201d Belichick said in his statement. \u201cInstead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "CBS spokesman Richard Huff didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "The awkward interview added to the attention and curiosity that has followed the 73-year-old Belichick, hired as the Tar Heels' head coach in December after his ultra-successful run with the New England Patriots, and the 24-year-old Hudson, who has frequently posted glimpses into their relationship with social media photos. That has included her role in Belichick's transition to college coaching, such as a March public records report by The Assembly about Belichick's request for an athletic official at UNC to copy in Hudson on emails sent to him.",
      "In his Wednesday statement, Belichick said he shares \u201cboth a personal and professional relationship\u201d with Hudson and that he expected the interview would focus solely on the book release instead of his personal life. He said Hudson had \u201cstepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion\" in an effort to \u201censure the interview stayed on track.\u201d",
      "He also said the couple has \u201cbeen open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021.\u201d",
      "During the CBS interview, Belichick shrugged off attention on his relationship with Hudson, saying: \u201cNever been too worried about what everybody else thinks, just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\u201d",
      "When Dokoupil asked how they met, Hudson \u2014 sitting at a nearby table \u2014 said flatly: \u201cWe're not talking about this.\u201d",
      "In a statement Tuesday, InkWell Management \u2014 a literary agency working with Belichick on his upcoming book \u2014 said the interview \u201cveered\u201d into a discussion of Belichick's personal life and resulted \"in a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\u201d",
      "\u201cBill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" the agency said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that the majority of veterans will be unrestricted free agents after this season based on current contracts. It\u2019s unclear if that will equate to a ton of player movement,\u201d Atlanta Dream general manager Dan Padover said. \u201cBut everything is set up that it could be the most player movement in WNBA history. I think every franchise is looking at it differently.",
      "\"Our most important priority is taking care of our Dream players in 2025 and beyond.\u201d",

It could be Golden State, it could Toronto or Portland in their first year. It could completely change the power dynamic as we see it.\u201d",
      "A\u2019ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart are among the star-studded group on one-year contracts knowing that a new collective bargaining agreement will hopefully be in place next season that is expected to monumentally increase salaries. The WNBA begins an 11-year $2.2 billion media rights deal in 2026 which is where the shift will come from.",
      "Most of the players who won't be free agents are the ones on rookie contracts \u2014 including Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The pair, who were rookies last season, earn about $75,000 in base pay. Currently WNBA players can have a maximum base salary of $250,000.",
      "While there hasn't been a media rights deal like this in the WNBA's 28-year history, when the NBA had an exponential increase in its TV deal in 2016, that league's salary cap increased about 35%.",
      "It\u2019s not just increased salaries, however, that will entice free agents to move. Many of the players who changed teams this offseason cited practice facilities as a factor in choosing where they\u2019ll go.",

He led Detroit\u2019s massive and largely unprecedented one-year turnaround, with the Pistons going from 14-68 and the bottom of the NBA last season to 44-38 and a playoff team this season.",
      "Zubac had the best numbers of his nine-year career, averaging 16.8 points, 12.6 rebounds and 2.7 assists. He also played a career-best 80 games and logged nearly 33 minutes on average in those contests, plus was one of the league\u2019s top defensive players.",
      "Daniels\u2019 first season in Atlanta was nothing like either of his first two NBA seasons with New Orleans. His numbers soared with career-bests in points (14.1, more than double his 5.8 average last season), rebounds (5.9), assists (4.4), steals (a league-leading 3.0) and his field-goal shooting went from 43.5% in his first two seasons to 49.3% this year. The Hawks made him a full-time starter, something Daniels hadn\u2019t been with the Pelicans.",

      "The Atlanta Falcons have been fined $250,000 and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich has been fined $100,000 as the result of Ulbrich\u2019s son participating in a prank call to Shedeur Sanders during the NFL draft",
      "ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Falcons have been fined $250,000 and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich has been fined $100,000 as the result of Ulbrich\u2019s son participating in a prank call to Shedeur Sanders during the NFL draft.",
      "The NFL confirmed the fines on Wednesday for the roles by the Falcons and Ulbrich in failing to prevent the disclosure of confidential information distributed to the club in advance of the NFL draft.",
      "The Falcons, who disclosed the role of Ulbrich\u2019s 21-year-old son Jax in the prank call as Sanders was waiting for his name to be called in the draft, said Wednesday they accept the discipline from the league.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the NFL\u2019s swift and thorough review of last week\u2019s data exposure and the event that transpired due to it,\u201d the Falcons said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe were proactive in addressing the situation internally and cooperated fully with the league throughout the process, and accept the discipline levied to Coach Jeff Ulbrich and the organization. We are confident in our security policies and practices and will continue to emphasize adherence to them with our staff whether on or off premises.\u201d",
      "The Falcons also said the Ulbrich family \u201cis working with the organization to participate in community service initiatives in relation to last week\u2019s matter.\u201c",
      "On Sunday, the Falcons said in a statement that Jax Ulbrich \u201cunintentionally came across the draft contact phone number for Shedeur Sanders off an open iPad while visiting his parent\u2019s home and wrote the number down to later conduct a prank call.\u201d",
      "Jax Ulbrich was sitting beside an unidentified friend who actually made the call to Sanders on Friday, the second day of the draft. Sanders, a standout quarterback from Colorado, is the son of Buffaloes coach and Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, who began his NFL career with the Falcons.",
      "Sanders, who entered the draft expecting to be a first-round pick, was selected Saturday in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns.",
      "The Falcons said Jeff Ulbrich was unaware of the data exposure or the prank until after the fact. The team offered \u201csincere apologies to Shedeur Sanders and his family.\u201d Jax Ulbrich also posted a public apology on social media.",
      "The NFL continues to investigate prank calls made to other players during the NFL draft. The Associated Press reported Tuesday the call to Shedeur Sanders wasn\u2019t related to the other prank calls.",
      "Tyler Warren, Kyle McCord, Mason Graham and Chase Lundt also have reported receiving prank calls.",

      "Ronan the sea lion can still keep a beat after all these years.",
      "She can groove to rock and electronica. But the 15-year-old California sea lion's talent shines most in bobbing to disco hits like \u201cBoogie Wonderland.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",
      "Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some primates. But then there\u2019s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the meaning of music.",
      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",
      "Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
      "What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.",
      "\u201cScientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners \u2014 like humans and parrots \u2014 could learn to find a beat,\u201d said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico\u2019s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.",
      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",
      "To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",
      "Ronan was the top diva.",
      "\u201cNo human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\u201d said Cook, adding that \"she's much better than when she was a kid,\u201d indicating lifetime learning.",
      "The new study confirms Ronan's place as one of the \u201ctop ambassadors\u201d of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers plan to train and test other sea lions. Cook suspects other sea lions can also bob to a beat \u2014 but that Ronan will still stand out as a star performer.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not how our AI should operate,\" Kaplan said on X. \"We\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\u201d",
      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

      "The genetic analysis was led by the Picuris. The researchers said this model of collaboration contrasts with a long history of archaeologists and geneticists seizing and studying artifacts and remains without the consent of Indigenous groups.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d to begin the collaboration with scientists, said co-author and Picuris Gov. Wayne Yazza. \u201cThis is life-changing data.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Ukraine on Wednesday signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral resources, finalizing a deal months in the making that could enable continued military aid to Kyiv amid concerns that President Donald Trump might scale back support in ongoing peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The two sides offered only barebone details about the structure of the deal, which they called the United States-Ukraine Reinvestment Fund. But it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a critical moment in the three-year war as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides. The signing comes two months after a different but similar agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump has long criticized Zelenskyy, saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to win the war and blaming him for prolonging the killing by not giving up Crimea, but in recent days has rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin as well, saying he was complicating negotiations with \u201cvery bad timing\u201d in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.",
      "Trump said Wednesday night on NewsNation that the deal, \u201cin theory,\u201d means that the U.S. will get more from Ukraine than it contributed. \u201cI wanted to be protected,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to be looking \u201cfoolish\u201d by not getting money back for the investment.",
      "For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.",
      "\u201cTruly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,\u201d said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \u201cThis is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal.",
      "\u201cTogether with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment to our country,\u201d she said in a post on X after the signing.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bessent said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House \u2014 hours after Ukrainian officials indicated a deal was nearly finalized \u2014 that there was still work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said when asked about reports that Ukraine was ready to agree to the pact. \"We\u2019re sure that they will reconsider that. And we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are.\u201d",
      "He didn't elaborate as to the late changes he said Ukraine made.",
      "The U.S. has been seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday, empowering Svyrydenko to sign it in Washington. The deal still needs to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it can take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.",
      "Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money \u2014 a complaint he repeated Wednesday during his Cabinet meeting. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.",
      "\u201cWe are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,\" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.",
      "Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.",
      "The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.",

      "The crew\u2019s landing module came down slowly after separating from the return vehicle, descending on a red-and-white parachute, in Dongfeng, in China\u2019s northern Inner Mongolia region on the edge of the Gobi Desert.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has issued a new policy for terminating international students' legal status",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status.",
      "The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status canceled in recent weeks with little explanation.",
      "In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.",
      "On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be canceled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the U.S.",
      "Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status. In the past, if a student had their visa revoked, they could stay in the U.S. to finish their studies \u2014 they simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "\u201cThis just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Banias said.",
      "Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.",
      "Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated \u2014 and then reinstated \u2014 this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.",
      "In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped \u2014 information that is also in NCIC.",
      "Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: \u201cPlease terminate all in SEVIS.\u201d That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.",
      "Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.",
      "\u201cAll of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,\u201d said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated \u201can utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.\u201d",
      "When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.",
      "Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled \u201cfailure to maintain status.\u201d Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an \u201cinvestigative red flag.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Patel is lawfully present in the U.S.,\u201d Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. \u201cHe is not subject to immediate detention or removal.\u201d",
      "Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.",

Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",
      "Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden's AI policies were \u201cpromoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "People with diseases caused by rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than other patients despite rapid recent advancements in the growing field of genetic science",
      "Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can\u2019t get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.",
      "She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won\u2019t help her.",
      "The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases \u2014 and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.",
      "\u201cWe feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,\u201d said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. \u201cBut we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It\u2019s really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.\u201d",
      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

      "Most of President Donald Trump\u2019s top nominees have sailed through the Senate with little resistance",
      "WASHINGTON -- Most of President Donald Trump\u2019s top nominees have sailed through the Senate with little resistance. His pick to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation\u2019s capital could be an exception.",
      "Ed Martin Jr., a conservative activist with modest legal experience who has defended rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is testing Republican party loyalties as a deadline approaches for the Senate to decide whether to extend or end his brief but tumultuous tenure as leader of the country\u2019s largest U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.",
      "Martin\u2019s nomination faces vocal opposition from hundreds of veterans of the office that he is leading on an interim basis. Democrats are trying to tie up his confirmation vote. And Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have said they need more time to review his record.",
      "There were signs of trouble at a Judiciary meeting on Thursday as Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the panel, said it was his understanding that committee chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was going to announce \u201cthat we are not going to move forward on the Martin nomination.\u201d",
      "Grassley demurred, saying he would wait to talk about Martin until the committee scheduled a vote. But he said he was still going through hundreds of questions that the committee had posed to Martin, adding that some of his staff \u201chad more questions\u201d and wanted to meet with him in person.",
      "It was hardly a ringing endorsement of Martin, who hasn\u2019t spent much time in courtrooms but has been a devoted loyalist to Trump.",
      "Within days of taking office in January, Martin fired or demoted veteran attorneys who prosecuted Trump supporters for storming the U.S. Capitol. Before his appointment, he represented and helped raise money for Capitol riot defendants. He frequently appeared on Russian state media to parrot Trump talking points. He even published coloring books glorifying Trump's tweets.",
      "Martin hasn\u2019t responded to several Associated Press interview requests since he took office in January, including this week.",
      "Martin recently told NBC Washington that he is confident that Trump made the \u201cright decision\u201d in nominating him. He has touted his office's work tackling violent crime. And he has told lawmakers that his opinions won\u2019t influence his office decisions.",
      "\u201cWe have to keep the streets safe AND fight for America on the world stage. Amazing work and I am blessed to serve Donald Trump in this way,\" Martin wrote in a Substack post.",
      "Any vote on Martin's nomination is bound to be split along party lines. But first, Democrats are calling for a rare hearing where they can grill him.",
      "The Judiciary panel traditionally does not hold confirmation hearings for U.S. attorneys, relying on questionnaires instead.",
      "Even if the committee were to approve Martin\u2019s nomination, it would face obstacles on the Senate floor. California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff placed a hold on the nomination, meaning Republicans would have to spend several days of floor time to confirm him. U.S. attorneys are generally approved in groups by a quick voice vote.",
      "Schiff last month said Martin \u201chas consistently undermined the independence and abused the power of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in D.C.\" since taking office.",
      "Martin has touted endorsements from leading conservative figures, including Elon Musk, Charlie Kirk and Donald Trump Jr. Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, also have expressed support.",
      "Paul in a post on X said he's confident Martin will \u201cwork to clean up DC and fight against the left\u2019s lawless judicial tyranny. Proud to support him as U.S. Attorney!\"",
      "His supporters have said his record fighting conservative causes makes him the right person to lead the office that critics have claimed unfairly treated Jan. 6 defendants and should have been more focused on bringing down street crime. Weeks into the job, he announced a \u201cMake D.C. Safe Again\u201d initiative to bring more gun cases in federal court, where penalties are stiffer.",
      "But a least one Republican member of the committee appears to have reservations. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who has expressed some concerns about Martin\u2019s Jan. 6 comments, said Thursday that he will meet with Martin next week.",
      "Trump appointed Martin the same week in January that he issued mass pardons to supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol four years ago. It was a morale-destroying choice for prosecutors who spent four years building cases against over 1,500 riot defendants, the largest investigation in Justice Department history.",
      "Martin was a leading figure in Trump's \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. He spoke at a rally in Washington on the eve of the riot. He also represented three Jan. 6 defendants, which he ranked among the top 10 cases of his legal career on his committee questionnaire.",
      "Former federal prosecutor Michael Romano, who was detailed to help supervise Jan. 6 prosecutions, returned to his home office in the Justice Department before Martin arrived. And yet Martin tried to demote Romano to an entry-level position along with other senior prosecutors who worked on Capitol riot cases.",
      "\u201cHe appeared not to realize that I didn\u2019t work for him,\u201d said Romano, who recently joined a private law firm. \u201cIt was a moment that made my eyes roll.\u201d",
      "Martin served on the board of the nonprofit Patriot Freedom Project, which reports raising over $2.5 million to support Jan. 6 defendants. Last year, he presented an award to a Capitol riot defendant, Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, who openly espoused white supremacist and antisemitic ideology and photographed himself sporting a Hitler mustache. He referred to Hale-Cusanelli as a friend who is \u201can extraordinary guy.\u201d",
      "Martin told committee members that he condemns Hale-Cusanelli's hateful comments as \"abhorrent and deplorable.\" He claimed he didn't learn about them until after he presented him with the award during an event at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.",
      "But Martin alluded to the controversy when he interviewed Hale-Cusanelli before the awards ceremony. Martin accused prosecutors of leaking photos of Hale-Cusanelli sporting the Hitler mustache to taint the jury pool.",
      "\"Not your best moment, but not illegal,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Critics have accused Martin of abusing his office \u2014 and his account on Musk's X platform \u2014 to intimidate potential targets of investigations.",
      "At least three medical journals received letters from Martin asking about \u201ccompeting viewpoints.\u201d Another letter that he sent on office stationery accused Wikipedia of \u201callowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda to the American public.\u201d",
      "Martin had a habit of getting ensnared in political controversies \u2014 and litigation \u2014 during his earlier forays into public service. Nearly two decades ago, he was chief of staff for then-Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt when he was sued by a former staff attorney who claimed he was fired in retaliation for complaining that the administration was destroying e-mails illegally.",
      "Martin was chairman of the Missouri Republican Party before becoming president of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum in April 2013. He co-authored a book about Trump with Schlafly, who died in 2016.",
      "Martin has referred to himself as one of the president\u2019s lawyers. His critics have call him unqualified and unfit for the job.",
      "\u201cEd Martin has less experience than a misdemeanor assistant does after a week in basic training. That\u2019s not an exaggeration,\u201d said Kevin Flynn, who worked as a prosecutor under roughly a dozen U.S. attorneys in Washington before leaving the office in 2023. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not exactly learning on the job, either.\u201d",

      "The former presidential candidate spoke as she considers re-entering politics.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stayed largely out of the political limelight since leaving office, sharply criticized President Donald Trump \u2013 her opponent in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 over tariffs, government cuts, and the direction his administration is taking the country, during remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco.",
      "Her remarks, delivered at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office, came as the Trump administration celebrates its accomplishments in its first 100 days \u2013 a date Harris acknowledged.",
      "\"Now I know tonight's event happens to coincide with 100 days after the inauguration, and I'll leave it to others to give a full accounting of what's happened so far,\" Harris told the audience.",
      "\"But I will say this, instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\" she said.",
      "Harris has had few public appearances since departing the White House and has limited her political activity, but on Wednesday night, she called out Trump by name.",
      "\"We all know President Trump, his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,\" Harris said.",
      "\"But what they're overlooking, what they've overlooked, is that fear isn't the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious,\" Harris said to raucous cheers.",
      "Harris had brought up similar themes \u2013 including the \"courage is contagious\" line \u2013 during remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April.",
      "That courage, Harris added on Wednesday, extends to Americans protesting against what she called \"the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.\"",
      "\"Americans across the political spectrum who are declaring that the president's reckless tariffs hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials; devastate the retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into; and paralyze American businesses, large and small forcing them to lay off people, stop hiring, or pause investment decisions,\" she said.",
      "Trump and the White House have argued that tariffs will help Americans be better off economically in the long run and will level the playing field between the U.S. and its trading partners.",
      "Later in her remarks, speaking more broadly about the White House's actions, Harris said she would describe the current moment in America as a \"high-velocity event\" to implement an agenda she claimed was \"decades in the making\" to shrink and privatize government while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\"It's an agenda, a narrow self-serving vision of America, where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power and leave everyone to fend for themselves, all while abandoning allies and retreating from the world,\" Harris said. \"And folks, what we are experiencing right now is exactly what they envision for America.\"",
      "Americans should be ready, if the \"checks and balances\" such as Congress \"ultimately collapse,\" Harris said, to work together and raise their voices.",
      "\"I am not here tonight to offer all the answers, but I am here to say this, you are not alone, and we are all in this together -- and straight talk, things are probably going to get worse before they get better, but we are ready for it. We are not going to scatter. We are going to stand together, everyone a leader,\" Harris said.",
      "At the end of her remarks, Harris struck a populist note: \"Always remember this country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to We The People.\"",
      "The former Democratic nominee for president has had few public appearances since departing the White House, and has limited her political activity.",
      "Harris' speech came as she is set to possibly re-enter politics in the coming months. Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.",
      "Some Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.",
      "Whether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "In remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "And in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"",
      "Harris and her spouse, Doug Emhoff, have been the target of recent actions by Trump.",
      "Trump issued a memo in March that revoked the security clearances and access to classified information of his previous presidential opponents -- Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris -- as well as more than a dozen former administration officials. On Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been dismissed from the board of trustees of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as the White House confirmed it had removed board members.",

      "The promise also comes as the Defense Department faces a potential loss of personnel available to process sexual assault cases due to efforts by the Trump administration to trim staff across government.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the standard of proof remains the same with regard to any sexual harassment complaint,\" said Dr. Nathan Galbreath, director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.",
      "\"To that end, all complaints are reviewed, the evidence is analyzed, and a legal officer often opines on whether or not action can be taken,\" Galbreath told reporters in a briefing call on tracking sexual assault cases in the military.",
      "Last week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called on service secretaries to review equal opportunity programs to ensure discrimination complaints weren't being \"weaponized\" by disgruntled employees.",
      "The military tracks sexual harassment complaints through its equal opportunity personnel.",
      "In his April 23 directive, Hegseth specifically called on secretaries to ensure discrimination \"complaints that are unsubstantiated by actionable, credible evidence are timely dismissed.\" He called it the \"no more walking on eggshells policy.\"",
      "\"Too often, at the Defense Department, there are complaints made that for certain reasons that can't be verified that end people's careers,\" Hegseth said in a video posted on X.",
      "\"Some individuals use these programs in bad faith to retaliate against superiors or peers. I hear that all the time,\" he said of employee discrimination complaints.",
      "Galbreath and other officials said Hegseth's directive won't impact how sexual assault reports or sexual harassment complaints are handled.",
      "Still, Hegseth\u2019s directive rattled advocates who say they are worried the secretary's orders would discourage people when thinking about coming forward with any misconduct, whether its sexual harassment or racial discrimination.",
      "\u201cThis new policy sends a stark and chilling message: report misconduct at your own risk,\u201d wrote Josh Connolly, senior vice president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group aimed at ending sex assault in the military.",
      "When asked if Hegseth's latest mandate will raise the standard of proof for sexual assault victims, Galbreath said \"no.\"",
      "When it comes to sexual assault, unfounded reports are extraordinarily rare. According to the military, 1% of cases involve evidence that either exonerates the person accused or shows the crime did not occur.",
      "President Donald Trump also asked the Pentagon to review regulations that are potentially burdensome and streamline operations, an effort that resulted in offers to employees for early retirement as well as hiring freezes across the department.",
      "Galbreath and other officials told reporters Thursday that they aren't sure exactly how the military's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program will be affected just yet when it comes to staff levels.",
      "When a recent hiring freeze went into effect, there were about 300 sexual assault prevention jobs put on hold, said Dr. Andra Tharp, director of the Defense Department's office of command climate and well-being integration.",
      "\"We're really trying to get our arms around total impacts of that,\" she said.",
      "Galbreath said he is encouraging the services to seek hiring exemptions for sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates.",
      "He said that 100% of victim services remain available now and that sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates are stationed at every military installation around the world.",
      "The number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year, according to data released by the department.",
      "The report is the first full-year account since the Pentagon put in place new prosecution procedures that empower independent lawyers, rather than military commanders. The changes were called for by lawmakers who said not enough was being done to encourage personnel to report assault.",
      "\"Even though we'd like to see the number of reports increase, I'm still very satisfied that our military members know that they can come forward,\" and \"get the help that they need to recover,\" said Galbreath.",

      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press release. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.

      "Consumer egg prices have climbed 25% since January, data shows.",
      "President Donald Trump this week disputed criticism over high egg prices in an exclusive interview with ABC News, faulting his predecessor for the price hike and claiming what he described as a recent decline in egg prices.",
      "\u201cYou remember the big thing with eggs? They hit me the first week, \u2018Eggs, eggs, eggs,\u2019 like it was my fault. I said, \u2018I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by [Joe] Biden,\u2019\u201d Trump told ABC News\u2019 Terry Moran.",
      "\u201cEgg prices are down,\u201d Trump later added.",
      "The remarks echoed claims made repeatedly by Trump since he took office, but his assessment of egg prices is potentially misleading, some food economists told ABC News.",
      "Retail egg prices, or the prices paid by shoppers, have climbed over the early months of Trump\u2019s term, meaning household budgets have been slammed by worsening egg costs, the economists said.",
      "By contrast, wholesale egg prices -- the amount grocers pay to suppliers -- have dropped significantly since Trump took office, though Trump appeared to overstate the amount of decline during the ABC News interview.",
      "It remains unclear when and to what extent that decline in wholesale egg prices will translate into relief for consumers, economists added.",
      "\u201cEgg prices have been increasing at the retail level and that\u2019s really important when assessing the claim President Trump made yesterday,\u201d said David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University.",
      "Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, added: \"I encourage people who are reading the news about food prices to focus on consumer prices, not wholesale prices, because that\u2019s what real consumers care about.\"",
      "Economists also largely rejected the attribution of blame for egg prices to any president, whether former President Joe Biden or Trump, saying a president exerts minimal influence over day-to-day egg costs.",
      "\u201cThe president has little or no control over egg prices,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cAny changes, whether egg prices go up or down, have almost nothing to do with what the president or any other policymaker is doing.\u201d",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s claim that eggs prices are falling, the price paid by shoppers has increased significantly since he took office, food economists said.",
      "The average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, the most recent month for which data is available. That change in price amounted to a 25% spike, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.",
      "In recent years, bird flu -- also known as avian flu -- has decimated the egg supply while demand has persisted, lifting prices higher.",
      "\u201cEven as egg prices have exploded over the last year or two, we\u2019ve actually seen really strong demand for eggs,\u201d Trey Malone, a food economist at Purdue University, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cThe reality is it\u2019s really hard to substitute away from eggs. I can\u2019t make cookies without eggs if I want to make grandma\u2019s recipe.\u201d",
      "In recent months, however, the rise in retail egg prices has coincided with a drop in wholesale prices. That decline largely owes to an easing of the avian flu outbreak, food economists told ABC News.",
      "When Trump refers to a drop in egg prices, he may be referring to the decline in wholesale prices. In a memo on Tuesday listing economic accomplishments, the White House highlighted the drop in wholesale egg prices while acknowledging that retail prices may still be elevated for some consumers.",
      "\"Most consumers have seen relief in prices on the shelf, but all consumers should see it within the next month or two,\" the White House said.",
      "Speaking with ABC News on Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cEggs are down 87% since I got involved.\"",
      "Trump has provided different figures for the size of the drop in egg prices. On April 17, he said prices had fallen 92%, while on April 4 he said egg prices had dropped 87%.",
      "Each of those figures overstates the drop in wholesale egg prices, according to data from the USDA.",
      "On Jan. 21, the day after Trump took office, the average wholesale price of a dozen eggs stood at $6.55; as of April 30, that price had dropped to $3.25, a Trading Economics analysis of USDA data shows. That change in price amounts to a roughly 50% decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not accurate to say egg prices have decreased by 87%,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cWholesale egg prices are down but they\u2019re not down by that much.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Trump\u2019s \"America First\" policy has already had impact around the globe.",
      "When President Donald J. Trump took the oath of office for the second time, he promised that the moment marked not only the culmination of his own extraordinary political comeback, but a resurgence on the global stage for the United States as a whole.",
      "\"From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world,\" he declared in his inaugural address. \"We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.\"",
      "Trump's vow to \"very simply, put America first\" over a world he says has taken advantage of it for far too long, and the frenetic speed at which his administration moved to implement his vision, has sparked ample amounts of conflict and chaos, putting the U.S. at odds at with its traditional allies and injecting new uncertainty into longstanding conflicts.",
      "Experts and officials say that the dramatic transformation of American statecraft during the first 100 days of Trump's second term promise to have lasting impact on the country and its global standing -- and meaningful reverberations for the world order at large.",
      "Trade wars go global",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Trump ignited no shortage of trade disputes, taking on China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico at varying points throughout the term while also issuing tariffs on various categories of imports.",
      "When he returned to Washington, Trump wasted little time -- almost immediately waging a sweeping campaign against what he says are grossly unbalanced economic partnerships and double-dealing international institutions designed to swindle the U.S.",
      "Yet, Trump's trade fights have been as a volatile as they are contentious, with tariff hikes often delayed by last minute reprieves. This added uncertainty has shaken investors and perhaps exacerbated many American consumers' sense of economic unease.",
      "\"So far, the results have been spectacularly bad. Trump's trade policy has lurched from empty threats to sweeping tariffs to humiliating retreats, roiling markets and destroying remaining confidence in U.S. economic leadership,\" said Edward Alden, a columnist at Foreign Policy and visiting professor at Western Washington University.",
      "\"Unless the administration can bring some discipline to its approach, Trump will accomplish none of his goals and leave the United States poorer and weaker,\" he continued.",
      "But tariffs have also evolved into a tool deployed by the White House to coerce foreign governments to comply with its broader agenda.",
      "Just days after his return to the White House, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Colombia if its President Gustavo Petro didn't agree to take in deportees from the U.S. Petro initially said he would impose retaliatory tariffs but soon reversed course -- accepting two planeloads of migrants.",
      "Additionally, Trump's hawkish approach to tariffs has fueled tension between the world's two largest economies: China and the U.S.",
      "The trade relationship between the U.S. and Beijing was a frequent target of Trump's ire during his first term. Now, he has taken the feud to the next level-- raising levies on Chinese imports as high as 145%.",
      "This time around also feels like a more personal battle between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. White House officials have hinted that trade negotiations between the nations have been quietly taking place -- a claim China's foreign ministry adamantly denies. Beijing also disputes a claim the president made in a recent interview with Time that Xi had called him.",
      "\"With both sides convinced they hold the advantage -- and neither signaling a shift in posture -- the U.S.-China relationship is entering a new era of heightened confrontation,\" said Craig Singleton, the senior director of the China Program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "Despite the apparent lack of progress toward a trade deal with China, the White House says more than 100 countries around the world have come to the table in the wake of the president's tariff war -- a dynamic that will test the administration's ability to simultaneously carry out so many complicated economic negotiations in the weeks and months to come.",
      "Expansionist intent",
      "In his second term, the president's international ambitions have extended well beyond tariffs. Even before taking office, Trump indicated he was laser focused on assuming control of two foreign territories: the Panama Canal and Greenland.",
      "Administration officials often argue that in both cases, the president is primarily concerned about foreign interference and its impact on national security. But other statements and actions signal there may be more at play.",
      "On Saturday, Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform that American ships should be able to transit the Panama Canal as well as Egypt's Suez Canal free of charge, adding that he had directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"immediately take care of\" the situation.",
      "And when Vice President J.D. Vance visited Greenland in March, he indicated that the Trump administration's interest in the territory was fueled in part by interest in edging out China and Russia in the competition for the rare earth resources that may lie buried under its ice sheet.",
      "\"We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in Arctic passageways and Arctic naval routes and indeed in the minerals of the Arctic territories. We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic, because we know that if America doesn't other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind,\" Vance said.",
      "The Trump administration's drive to secure critical minerals is also intertwined in its dealings with Ukraine and appears to have motivated efforts to secure peace in other areas of the world. As part of its work to pave the way for U.S. investments in the mineral-rich Democratic Republic of the Congo, the administration has played a key role in brokering peace negotiations between the country and Rwanda.",
      "Deals deferred",
      "Meanwhile, other longstanding conflicts the president initially declared he would swiftly resolve continue to rage as U.S. mediation efforts sputter.",
      "Trump famously said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine on \"day one\" of his second term -- a claim he now says was \"an exaggeration.\"",
      "The first 100 days of the second Trump term have seen the U.S. approach to Russia and Ukraine undergo a dramatic shift.",
      "With Moscow, the Trump administration has brought about a significant warming of relations. Delegations from both the U.S. and Russia have been involved in slow but steady talks to revive their diplomatic presences in each other's countries, while top Trump administration negotiator Steve Witkoff has now met face-to-face with Russian leader Vladimir Putin four times.",
      "Dealings with Ukraine, on the other hand, have presented some of the administration's most intense and iconic foreign policy moments.",
      "In late February, Trump, Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sparred inside the Oval Office. After the spat, Zelenskyy was instructed to leave the White House",
      "Over this past weekend, in an entirely different scene from the Oval Office encounter, Trump and Zelensky met again -- this time, just two of them sitting alone, inside a hushed St. Peter's Basilica as world leaders gathered at the Vatican to pay their last respects to Pope Francis.",
      "Amid the stark highs and lows of his interactions with Zelenskyy, Trump has repeatedly insisted he is neutral and simply wants to put an end to the bloodshed.",
      "But Trump and his administration have also set a tight deadline for U.S. involvement in the process, with the president declaring after his meeting with Zelenskyy that he expected to see progress within \"two weeks or less.\"",
      "Critics of the Trump administration's approach have consistently faulted the president for failing to hold the Kremlin accountable.",
      "\"Trump's desire for peace is laudable. But the way he has pursued it -- undercutting Ukraine while putting no tangible pressure on Russia -- leaves much to be desired,\" said John Hardie, the deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "\"The shift in Washington's Ukraine policy under Trump has contributed to a broader erosion of European trust in America,\" he continued. \"The silver lining: Europe now appears more serious than ever about stepping up on defense.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the 101st day of the president\u2019s term, the Trump administration did secure one deal with Ukraine -- signing onto a long-awaited partnership with the country that gives American businesses access to Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources.",
      "Administration officials say the partnership will provide Kyiv with implicit security guarantees by increasing U.S. involvement in Ukraine\u2019s economy, but the agreement has no direct impact on efforts to finally bring the war with Russia to a close.",
      "Israel, Gaza",
      "With Israel's war in Gaza, the Trump administration has taken a more hands-off approach, even though the conflict appeared to be on the brink of a resolution when he re-entered the White House in January.",
      "In tandem with the outgoing Biden administration, Trump officials worked to secure a three-phase ceasefire/hostage-release that saw the release of 33 captives that had been detained since the Oct. 7 attacks, including two Americans. But the framework fell apart before the parties could move into its second phase, which would see the release of the final American hostage held in Gaza.",
      "Despite promises to find an endgame for the conflict, much of Trump's focus seems to have been on his unusual proposal to relocate Gazans and redevelop the territory, a pitch that was met by widespread backlash.",
      "But Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and former National Security Council official, says Trump will eventually have to take on the conflict -- or see his agenda constrained by it.",
      "\"The Israeli-Palestinian front remains the thorniest and most difficult challenge to producing progress in the Middle East. Without a clear game plan to end the war, bring hostages home, and improve the living conditions for the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, the Trump administration's wider aspirations for the Middle East will continue to face limits,\" he said.",
      "In the first months of his term, Trump has also rekindled long-stagnant nuclear talks with Iran -- while also declaring he would be \"leading the pack\" in a military strike on the country if it did not ultimately agree to a deal.",
      "Diplomacy deconstructed",
      "The initial weeks of Trump's second term have seen no shortage of turmoil in Washington, and the president's aims of shrinking the federal government and ramping up efficiency have resulted in significant cuts to diplomatic structures.",
      "As one of his first executive actions, Trump ordered a freeze on all foreign aid spending. His administration quickly began lobbing accusations of fraud and other misdeeds against the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and moved to close it. By February it had suspended most of its employees, and by March, officials developed plans to fold the few programs that had not been cancelled into the framework of the State Department.",
      "But the State Department is also bracing for major staffing reductions. In April, Rubio unveiled plans to drastically overhaul the department by sharply cutting the number of offices within it and ultimately wiping out roughly 700 Washington, D.C.-based positions for Foreign Service and Civil Service employees.",
      "Additionally, Rubio has instructed leaders throughout the department to draw up plans to reduce their personnel by 15% -- a move that could lead to thousands of additional job cuts.",
      "Already, the second Trump administration has seen the State Department shift its focus from international organizations and peacekeeping efforts to carrying out the president's deportation goals and securing the southern border. Rubio's first actions in his post include designating international cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and securting various deals with South American and Central American nations -- including, most controversially, El Salvador -- to accept deportees from the U.S.",
      "Beyond Washington, Trump has also withdrawn from a number of international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations Human Rights Council.",
      "At the 100-day mark, there is one vacant seat in Trump's Cabinet: the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.",
      "\"Trump believes his actions will consolidate U.S. power and put an end to America being 'ripped off' by an outdated international system,\" said Bronwen Maddox, the director and chief executive of Chatham House.",
      "\"The danger is that by unpicking the alliances and institutions that have underpinned US power at such breakneck speed, Trump ends up handing the US's many advantages \u2013 in innovation, commercial strength and global influence -- to Beijing,\" she added.",

      "In his interview with ABC News on his 100th day in office, President Donald Trump was asked about one of his biggest supporters sounding the alarm about his aggressive migrant deportation plan.",
      "Joe Rogan told his audience of millions on his April 17 episode that \"rounding up gang members and shipping them to El Salvador with no due process\" was \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"We gotta be careful that we don't become monsters while we're fighting monsters,\" Rogan said.",
      "Responding to that quote in an interview with ABC News anchor and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran on Tuesday -- who asked whether Rogan was right -- Trump said he was.",
      "\"Oh, I agree with that a hundred percent, yeah,\" the president said. \"We want to be careful. We are careful.\"",
      "When asked about the various court challenges to the deportations and court orders admonishing his administration for not following the law, Trump pushed back, calling those being deported \"criminals.\" He claimed Venezuelan \"criminals are now living happily in the United States of America, and we're getting 'em out.\"",
      "\"And I was elected to get 'em out, and we're getting them out, getting them out fast, and we're getting them out legally,\" he said.",
      "Moran stressed that \"in our country even bad guys get due process,\" but Trump contended the situation is different for migrants in the country illegally.",

      "\"But they get due process,\" Moran said.",
      "\"Well, they get a process where we have to get 'em out, yeah,\" Trump said.",

      "Trump alleged that Abrego Garcia was a violent gang member, even though judges have said such claims have not been proven in court by prosecutors in the weeks since he was arrested.",
      "\"You could get him back. There's a phone on this desk,\" Moran said.",

    "story": [
      "The World Trade Center Health Program is at a standstill, an FDNY official said.",
      "A 9/11 responder with life-threatening pancreatic cancer was told this week that he couldn't start chemotherapy. Two others with new cancer diagnoses were also denied treatment, according to Dr. David Prezant, chief medical officer of the New York City Fire Department and director of its World Trade Center Health Program.",
      "\"We postponed chemotherapy for a firefighter this week, hoping this could be fixed,\" Prezant said \"He's too young for Medicare, and this delay may cost him his life.\"",
      "All three patients were part of the federally funded World Trade Center Health Program \u2014 a system created to care for those who risked their lives on Sept. 11, 2001. But the program has come to a standstill, Prezant said.",
      "The program's longtime leader, Dr. John Howard, was removed in February \u2014 and then rehired after bipartisan backlash. But according to Prezant, it remains unclear whether his legal role as administrator was actually restored.",
      "\"It appears that Dr. John Howard, Director of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Administrator of the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) was not properly reinstated as Administrator of the World Trade Center Health Program, as the Health and Human Services Department told the NY Republican Members of Congress which they announced on April 5,\" Citizens for the Extension of the James Zadroga Act, an advocacy group, said in a statement on its website.",
      "Prezant said that although he has asked numerous times for clarification from the World Trade Center Health Program, he has provided no information as to why Howard has not been fully reinstated or why the certifications cannot continue.",
      "He said he was not clear if Howard's position was in limbo due to DOGE cuts or some other reason. Advocates also said they believed that Howard's limbo status appears separate from earlier staffing cuts and budget shortfalls worsened by inflation.",
      "But without formal certification, treatment for new conditions cannot proceed, he emphasized.",
      "ABC reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services for an explanation but did not hear back. In a statement sent earlier this week in response to staffing cuts, an agency spokesperson said, \"The Program continues to accept and review new enrollment applications and certification requests.\"",
      "However, an internal email from HHS sent earlier this month that was shared with ABC News said, \"We have been directed not to process any new certifications.\"",
      "Until this week, clinics were allowed to begin treating patients under \"initial approvals,\" Prezant said, while waiting for formal certification from the federal program. But that emergency workaround was shut down this week, he explained.",
      "The process of attaining formal certification required submitting documentation such as biopsy results, lung scans, and other medical evidence \u2014 and then acquiring a signature from the program administrator, which should have been Howard.",
      "This is \"a clear sign that Dr. Howard hasn't been fully reinstated,\" according to Prezant.",
      "To receive care through the program, a responder or survivor must first enroll \u2014 and then have their illness formally certified by the federal program as being related to 9/11 exposure. Certification is a separate and critical step.",
      "Clinics must submit medical evidence, such as biopsy results or lung scans, and only after the program approves it can treatment move forward or compensation claims be filed. Without someone in place to authorize these certifications, patients with newly diagnosed conditions are stuck waiting.",
      "In addition to its freeze on certifying illnesses, Prezant said it seemed that the program can no longer enroll new members or approve life-saving treatments like chemotherapy, lung transplants, or stem cell therapy.",
      "Sixteen of the program's doctors, nurses, and support staff were laid off in early April \u2014 depleting the program by approximately 20%.",
      "Howard's unclear status follows layoffs earlier this month that followed a previous round of cuts in February \u2014 but those were reversed after bipartisan backlash. It hasn't yet been established if any of the newly terminated employees were part of the original group.",
      "Either way, the decision once again left the program critically understaffed, according to clinic leaders and advocacy groups.",
      "The program now serves more than 150,000 people nationwide, up from about 76,000 in 2015, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A bipartisan bill, HR 1410, was introduced in February to close the funding gap as enrollment surged, but it remains stalled in Congress.",
      "\"We don't decide who qualifies,\" said Prezant, noting that eligibility rules and certification decisions are set by the federal program under the Zadroga Act. \"That protects the system from fraud \u2014 and it works.\"",
      "He pointed to FDNY data showing that five years after a cancer diagnosis, 86% of program patients are still alive \u2014 compared to just 66% among those diagnosed in New York State who are not enrolled in the program.",
      "Now, according to Prezant and others, patients in all 50 states who rely on care from the program are being turned away without clear answers about when, or if, the system will be restored.",
      "\"No one is asking for anything more than what was promised under the law,\" Prezant said, referring to the Zagroda Act's commitment to provide lifelong medical care and monitoring for 9/11 responders and survivors whose illnesses are linked to their exposure. \"We just want the federal government to honor that promise before more lives are lost.\"",

      "An Illinois landlord found guilty in a vicious hate crime that left a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy dead and his mother severely injured is due in court for sentencing",
      "JOLIET, Ill. -- An Illinois landlord found guilty of a vicious hate crime that left a 6-year-old Muslim boy dead and wounded his mother days after the start of the war in Gaza in 2023 was due in court Friday for sentencing.",
      "A jury convicted 73-year-old Joseph Czuba in February of murder and hate crime charges in the fatal stabbing of Wadee Alfayoumi, who was Palestinian American, and the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen. The family had been renting rooms in Czuba\u2019s home in Plainfield, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Chicago, in 2023 when the attack happened.",
      "Central to prosecutors' case was harrowing testimony from the boy\u2019s mother, who said Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba's wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about the Israel-Hamas war, which had erupted days earlier.",
      "Police said Czuba pulled a knife from a holder on a belt and stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child's body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee's relatives.",
      "\u201cHe could not escape,\u201d Michael Fitzgerald, a Will County assistant state\u2019s attorney, told jurors at trial. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy\u2019s body.\u201d",
      "The jury deliberated for 90 minutes before returning a verdict. Czuba is eligible for a minimum prison sentence of 20 to 60 years or life, according to the Will County state's attorney's office.",
      "Prosecutors declined to comment ahead of Friday's hearing and have not said what sentence they will seek. Illinois does not have the death penalty.",
      "The attack renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination and hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community. Wadee's funeral drew large crowds and Plainfield officials have dedicated a park playground in his honor.",
      "Czuba did not speak during the trial. His defense attorneys argued that there were holes in the case. His public defender, George Lenard, has not addressed reporters and declined comment ahead of the sentencing.",
      "Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds and it took her weeks to recover.",
      "She said there were no prior issues in the two years she rented from the Czubas, even sharing a kitchen and a living room.",
      "Then after the start of the war, Czuba told her that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. He later confronted Shaheen and attacked her, holding her down, stabbing her and trying to break her teeth.",
      "\u201cHe told me \u2019You, as a Muslim, must die,\u201d said Shaheen, who testified in English and Arabic though a translator.",
      "Police testified that officers found Czuba outside the house, sitting on the ground with blood on his body and hands.",
      "Separately, civil lawsuits have been filed over the boy\u2019s death, including by his father, Odai Alfayoumi, who is divorced from Shaheen and was not living with them. The U.S. Department of Justice also launched a federal hate crimes investigation.",

      "Police have said that the four people killed and two others seriously wounded in the multiple shootings were Native American, and authorities strongly suspect the shootings were gang-related. However, Police Chief Brian O'Hara said during a news conference Thursday that authorities are still investigating the motives behind the shootings.",
      "The shootings shook a large Indigenous community south of downtown Minneapolis.

      "Detailed Army plans for a potential military parade on President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday in June call for more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands and potentially a couple thousand civilians",
      "WASHINGTON -- Detailed Army plans for a potential military parade on President Donald Trump's birthday in June call for more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands and possibly a couple thousand civilians, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The planning documents, obtained by the AP, are dated April 29 and 30 and have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Trump has long wanted but is still being discussed.",
      "The Army anniversary just happens to coincide with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday on June 14.",
      "While the slides do not include any price estimates, it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars to put on a parade of that size. Costs would include the movement of military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.",
      "High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.",
      "Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made.",
      "Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, added that the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary.",
      "\u201cWe want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us,\u201d said Butler. \u201cWe want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\u201d",
      "Others familiar with the documents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been finalized, said they represent the Army's plans as it prepares for any White House approval of the parade. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely.",
      "In a Truth Social post Thursday night that did not mention the June 14 plans, Trump wrote, \u201cWe are going to start celebrating our victories again!\u201d He vowed to rename May 8, now known as Victory in Europe Day, as \u201cVictory Day for World War II,\u201d and to change November 11, Veterans Day, to \u201cVictory Day for World War I.\u201d",
      "Much of the equipment would have to be brought in by train or flown in.",
      "Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve an array of activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.",
      "A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support.",
      "The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding One.",
      "The plans say the parade would showcase the Army\u2019s 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",
      "According to the plan, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.",
      "And it is expected that the evening parade would be followed by a concert and fireworks.",
      "One of the documents raises concerns about some limitations, which include where troops would be housed and \u201csignificant concerns regarding security requirements\u201d as equipment flows into the city. It says the biggest unknown so far is which units would be participating.",
      "In his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs \u2014 with one estimate of a $92 million price tag \u2014 and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.",
      "Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.",
      "This year, as plans progressed for the Army to host its birthday festival in Washington, talk about a parade began anew.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14 that would stretch from Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery are located, across the Potomac River and into Washington.",
      "Bowser at the time said she didn\u2019t know if the event was being \u201ccharacterized as a military parade\u201d but added that tanks rolling through the city\u2019s streets \u201cwould not be good.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\u201d she said.",
      "In 2018, the Pentagon appeared to agree. A memo from the defense secretary's staff said plans for the parade \u2014 at that time \u2014 would include only wheeled vehicles and no tanks to minimize damage to local infrastructure.",

      "The order did not specify the manner in which Jordan will be executed. Mississippi law allows death sentences to be carried out using lethal injection, nitrogen gas, electrocution or firing squad.",
      "According to Mississippi Supreme Court records, Jordan kidnapped Edwina Marter in January 1976 and shot her to death in a forest in Harrison County. He then called her husband, Charles Marter, falsely claimed she was safe and asked for $25,000.",
      "Records show that before the killing Jordan had traveled from Louisiana to Gulfport, Mississippi and called the Gulf National Bank, where Charles Marter worked as a loan officer. After he was told Marter could speak with him, he hung up, looked up the Marters' home address and went to the house posing as an electric company employee.",

      "A bill that would strip the state\u2019s largest city of power over its local water board and give more control to the governor and surrounding suburbs is heading to the governor's desk",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama legislators passed a bill on Thursday that would strip Birmingham of control over the state's largest water board and transfer power to the governor and surrounding suburbs, reigniting a decades-long, polarizing debate.",
      "Proponents of the bill point to frequent rate hikes and say that the move will prevent catastrophic events that have happened in cities like Jackson, Mississippi, or Detroit, Michigan. Opponents of the bill say that it is a power grab that diminishes the power of Black residents in Birmingham, Alabama.",
      "Birmingham city officials currently appoint six of the nine board members' seats, giving Birmingham leadership unrivaled influence over the decisions affecting the city's water. Board members approve rate hikes and manage infrastructure projects.",
      "If signed into law, SB330 would make the board just seven people. The mayor of Birmingham and the Birmingham city council would appoint two board members, while the governor, lieutenant governor and three neighboring county commission presidents would each appoint one board member.",
      "Five counties rely on the Birmingham Water Works Board, but over 40% of the utility's 770,000 customers are concentrated in the city of Birmingham, and 91% are in Jefferson County. The new system would give more weight to Birmingham's neighboring counties that house the reservoirs that supply the system.",
      "Republican lawmakers from the Birmingham suburbs sponsored the bill, saying that it will improve the efficiency of the system. They say aging infrastructure and lack of investment means residents pay for water that just gets leaked out of old pipes.",
      "\u201cSo many elected officials have been getting so many complaints, and I\u2019m sure yours have too, about the quality and the price of Birmingham water,\u201d said Republican Rep. Jim Carns, who represents Blount County, one of the places that will now appoint a board member.",
      "The water board had approximately $1 billion in debt in 2023, according to the most recent financial statements, and the board has the second highest credit score, according to bond rating agencies.",
      "Carns said that the regional board would make the utility more frugal. AL.com reported that the utility has been accused of lacking transparency in recent years and has sometimes made costly errors in distributing bills. Trust in the board was further undermined in recent years after high-profile ethics scandals.",
      "Many in Alabama\u2019s vocal Democratic minority conceded that the board wasn't perfect, but they also condemned the move as a political takeover that would wrest power from Birmingham\u2019s majority Black residents and redistribute it to customers in the city's mostly white suburbs.",
      "\u201cFrankly the language used today was insulting, with words like competence being thrown around as if the city of Birmingham is not growing by leaps and bounds,\u201d Democratic Rep. Kelvin Datcher of Birmingham said after the bill passed. He questioned how the new board's composition would address any of the bill sponsor's concerns about efficiency.",
      "Democratic legislators also took issue with the fact that they were excluded from the overall process.",
      "\u201cEach of us in this chamber would be rightfully concerned if outside representatives attempted to dictate how water systems operate in our districts without consulting us or even including us at the table, or, hell, even the room where this legislation was created,\u201d Rep. Neil Rafferty of Birmingham said.",
      "Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin joined Birmingham city council members for a press conference to echo those concerns.",
      "\u201cThe ratepayers deserve to be at the forefront of this conversation, and they have not been,\u201d Woodfin said. \u201cLet\u2019s call it what it is. This is a political power grab. This is not in the best interest of our citizens.\u201d",

      "Evidence that she may have had a medical emergency was \u201cnot conclusive\u201d and the investigation is ongoing, Kelly said.",

It traveled through the building, striking people before exiting the other side. Six other children were hospitalized. Kelly said some of them have been released but he did not provide more detail, saying their families have asked for privacy.",

      "Schoemann, 43, filed to create a campaign committee on Wednesday. He is the executive of Washington County, one of the deepest red counties in Wisconsin, which President Donald Trump won with 67% of the vote in 2024.",
      "Schoemann has never run a statewide race before and is unlikely to be the only Republican candidate in the election that is 19 months away.",
      "Bill Berrien, a Whitefish Bay manufacturing businessman, created a political action committee two weeks ago as he also considers a run. Berrien is a Navy SEAL veteran and CEO of Pindel Global Precision and Liberty Precision in New Berlin.",
      "Others mentioned as potential candidates include U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who represents northern Wisconsin, and two-time losing U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde, a Madison businessman.",
      "Schoemann was elected as county executive in 2020 after previously working six years as county administrator and county manager. He is a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom and received an honorable discharge in October 2008 from the Army National Guard, according to his biography on the county website.",
      "Schoemann has a \u201chistoric summer kickoff cookout\u201d scheduled for Sunday in West Bend where he is expected to formally announce his candidacy.",
      "Ben Voelkel, a Schoemann spokesperson, declined to comment Thursday when asked if Schoemann would be launching his run on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe Republican primary for governor is going to be a who\u2019s who of far-right extremists tripping over themselves to earn Donald Trump\u2019s favor \u2014 and all Josh Schoemann has going for him is that he\u2019s first off the starting line,\" said Sarah Abel, executive director of the Wisconsin Democratic Party.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- A steady line of slow-moving thunderstorms that battered Oklahoma in recent weeks set multiple rainfall records across the state and helped ease drought conditions.",
      "But the saturated ground and torrential rains also came with a heavy price, including the deaths of multiple people who became trapped in their vehicles in rising floodwaters.",
      "On Thursday, a road washed away in a rural community south of Oklahoma City, stranding about 10 families whose only way out of their homes is a mile-and-a-half walk around a washed-out pond that broke through a retaining wall.",

      "North Carolina\u2019s Republican state auditor has started making appointments to a new State Board of Elections because an appeals court said a law can still be enforced while it is challenged by Democratic Gov. Josh Stein",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Republican state auditor made appointments to a new State Board of Elections on Thursday, the day after an appeals court agreed a law shifting that power otherwise held by the Democratic governor could still be enforced while the measure's constitutionality is appealed.",
      "Auditor Dave Boliek announced three members \u2014 all proposed by the state Republican Party chairman \u2014 to the five-member board.",
      "Two remain reserved for choices from the state Democratic Party, but Boliek said he had not received a slate of candidates from the Democratic chair. That is not surprising because Democrats and Stein are strongly opposed to the law finalized in December by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. Stein sued to overturn the law and stop its enforcement. Trial judges just last week sided with Stein and declared that stripping him of the board appointment authority was unconstitutional.",
      "But Boliek, who was elected last fall to the post, went ahead with appointments after the intermediate-level Court of Appeals on Wednesday said the appointment switch could be carried out while broader legal questions are reviewed on appeal.",
      "Stein asked the state Supreme Court late Wednesday to suspend the unanimous ruling of the three Court of Appeals judges and keep blocking the law. The justices had not ruled on that matter as of midday Thursday.",
      "The appointments if upheld could mark a dramatic change in election administration in the battleground state. For over a century, the governor has picked the five board members, three of whom are traditionally members of the governor\u2019s party. With Boliek the auditor, Republicans would now assume a majority on the board, whose duties include carrying out campaign finance laws, certifying election results and setting rules on voting administration details.",
      "The law containing the board appointment changes said the terms of the five most recent members, which were otherwise supposed to continue until 2027, expired Wednesday and that new members would be appointed to four-year terms that would begin Thursday.",
      "Boliek's appointments are a political victory for the GOP, which since late 2016 has sought to erode or eliminate a governor\u2019s authority to appoint the board. Four previous laws targeting then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper were blocked by courts. Voters in 2018 also rejected a constitutional amendment that would have forced the governor to pick members recommended by legislative leaders.",
      "Republicans have complained that a governor has too much control over elections, resulting in one-party decision-making and a lack of voter confidence. But Democrats say the laws are a GOP power grab designed to give Republicans an unfair advantage in elections.",
      "The board\u2019s importance has been apparent in the still-unresolved November election for a state Supreme Court seat between Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs and Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, himself a Court of Appeals judge.",
      "Stein said Wednesday after the Court of Appeals ruling that he feared the appointment changes would help Republicans succeed at helping Griffin win the seat. The current tally has Riggs slightly ahead.",
      "Boliek appointed on Thursday Stacy \u201cFour\u201d Eggers, who served on the most recent board; former state Sen. Bob Rucho; and Francis De Luca, former president of a conservative think tank.",
      "\u201cWe need full confidence in our elections, and I\u2019d like to thank these individuals for their willingness to serve,\u201d Boliek said in a press release.",
      "Lawyers for Stein argue the appointment transfer unlawfully interfered with the governor\u2019s responsibility in the state constitution to take care that laws were \u201cfaithfully executed.\u201d Two of three trial judges hearing the lawsuit sided April 23 with Stein. Their order also blocked a power transfer that would direct Boliek in June to choose the chairs of county election boards. But the appeals court decision set aside that judgment.",
      "Legislative leaders said the appointments transfer was lawful, arguing the state constitution allows the General Assembly to disperse executive branch powers to carry out laws to other statewide elected officials like the auditor.",
      "The Court of Appeals ruling favoring Republican lawmakers neither provided reasons for the judges' ruling nor identified the judges who ruled. In such matters, the court releases their names after 90 days.",

      "Donald Maier's mother, Jeanette Maier, filed her lawsuit Monday in federal court in Milwaukee alleging her son was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment at Waupun Correctional Institution. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and names state Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy, former Waupun Warden Randall Hepp and multiple Waupun staffers as defendants.",
      "Corrections spokesperson Kevin Hoffman declined to comment, saying the agency typically doesn't speak publicly about pending litigation. Hepp's attorney, Michael Steinle, didn't return an email Thursday.",
      "Donald Maier, 62, was found dead in his cell in February 2024 at Waupun. The Dodge County medical examiner determined he died of dehydration and failure to thrive due to malnutrition. Investigators found that guards had repeatedly shut off the water to his cell during the week leading up to Maier's death after he flooded his cell, according to court documents.",
      "Jeanette Maier's lawsuit alleges that Waupun staff failed to document the water shut-offs in violation of prison protocol, didn't tell him when the water was back on and didn't offer to get him any water themselves. He also didn't receive medication at Waupun, even though the state Corrections Department had designated him as suffering from a serious mental illness, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The filing also alleges that staff shortages at Waupun have left workers exhausted and extra shifts have left them resentful of inmates who need help.",
      "Waupun opened in 1854, making it Wisconsin's oldest maximum security prison. It's been plagued by a litany of problems in recent years.",
      "Inmates filed a federal class-action lawsuit in October 2023 alleging inhumane conditions at the prison, but dropped it in August 2024 after a judge found eight of 10 plaintiff inmates hadn't exhausted an internal complaint process.",
      "Seven inmates, including Maier, have died at the prison since 2023. Family members of three of them \u2014 Cameron Williams, Dean Hoffman and Tyshun Lemons \u2014 filed federal lawsuits last year. Those case are still pending.",
      "Williams was found dead of a stroke in his cell in October 2023. His mother alleges no one helped him, even though he'd been throwing up blood and begging to go to the emergency room for head pain in the days before he died.",
      "Hoffmann killed himself at the prison in June 2023. His daughter contends he went weeks without seeing any mental health care providers due to a lockdown and received medication only sporadically.",
      "Lemons died of a fentanyl overdose at the prison in October 2023. His sister maintains that Corrections failed to prevent illegal drugs from entering the prison.",
      "Federal investigators have been probing alleged smuggling at Waupun. The investigation has netted at least one former employee who pleaded guilty to smuggling cellphones and drugs in exchange for money.",
      "Hepp, the former warden, was charged in June with felony misconduct in connection with Maier's death after investigators concluded that he failed to ensure his staff followed policy. He pleaded no contest Monday to a misdemeanor count of violating laws governing state or county institutions in a deal with prosecutors and walked away with a $500 fine.",
      "Eight Waupun staffers were charged in June with abuse or misconduct in connection with either Maier or Williams' death. Charges have been dismissed against one of them and another was fined $250. The remaining cases are pending.",

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers are getting their turn to question a woman who alleges the one-time Hollywood heavyweight held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her nearly two decades ago",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein \u2019s lawyers got their turn Thursday to question a woman who alleges the one-time Hollywood heavyweight held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her nearly two decades ago.",
      "Miriam Haley, testifying for a third day at Weinstein\u2019s retrial, was grilled about her decision to hire a lawyer and go public with her allegations as the #MeToo movement exploded in October 2017.",
      "Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean sparred with Haley over the details of her early statements to the press about the alleged assault, getting her to admit that she didn't give interviewers back then a full picture of her relationship with Weinstein.",
      "Haley denied Bonjean\u2019s suggestion that she went public in hopes of suing Weinstein, but acknowledged she later filed a lawsuit and received a settlement of about $475,000.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone. His lawyers have argued that all of his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "Haley, the first of three accusers expected to testify, said Wednesday that she maintained contact with Weinstein for more than a year after the alleged assault she says happened at his Manhattan apartment in July 2006.",
      "Haley testified that she flew to Los Angeles on Weinstein\u2019s dime a day after the alleged assault, and a few weeks later agreed to meet him at a Manhattan hotel. She said she had expected to talk in the lobby, but was instead directed to his room, where he pulled her into bed for sex.",
      "Even after that, Haley testified, she kept in touch \u2014 sometimes calling Weinstein and sending emails signed \u201cLots of love\u201d to him and his assistant over the next few months and years. She insisted she was looking for professional opportunity and was never interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with him.",
      "Bonjean pointed out Thursday that when Haley went public, she didn\u2019t mention her subsequent sexual encounter with Weinstein, nor their continued contact.",
      "\u201cYou told the press only part of the story, correct?\u201d Bonjean asked.",
      "\u201cI told the part that was relevant to what I was trying to share,\u201d Haley said.",
      "Bonjean noted that Haley didn't report her allegations to police until June 2018, but held a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred just days after she first saw media reports about other women accusing Weinstein of wrongdoing.",
      "Bonjean asked if Haley had been \u201ctrying to send a message to\u201d Weinstein.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t really thinking about Mr. Weinstein in that press conference,\u201d Haley responded, adding that she spoke out to support other accusers who had also done so.",
      "Bonjean will step away from Weinstein\u2019s defense team after she finishes questioning Haley. Another case Bonjean is working on is going to trial in Brooklyn next week.",
      "On Wednesday, under questioning by a prosecutor, Haley recalled the alleged 2006 assault as a friendly, professional meeting at Weinstein\u2019s apartment that he turned into \u201cthe unthinkable.\u201d She said he ignored her pleas of: \u201cNo, no \u2014 it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she felt shocked, disgusted and humiliated. She and two of her friends testified that she soon told them that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is the first of Weinstein\u2019s accusers to testify at his rape retrial. She is reprising her testimony from his first trial in 2020 after his conviction was overturned last year, albeit with some details that weren\u2019t heard before.",
      "On Wednesday, she recalled Weinstein had asked her, \u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019re much closer now?\u201d after either the alleged assault or a subsequent occasion when she says she had unwanted, but not forced, sex with him.",
      "Haley was briefly a production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway\u201d and had a series of interactions with him that were sometimes inappropriate and suggestive, but other times professional and polite, she told jurors.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial includes charges related to Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann. Mann alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013. He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "The population rose an estimated 1%, adding 108,000 people compared to 2023, according to a report released Thursday by the Department of Finance. The increase is due in part to the number of births outpacing deaths and a boost in the number of adults 65 and older. The state said it also had better data to account for increases in legal immigration into the state from other countries.",
      "About one in nine people living in the United States reside in California.",
      "The Democratic governor touted the population gains as a sign of the state\u2019s growing economy, which is one of the largest in the world. The size of the state's economy has now surpassed that of Japan, which puts it only behind the U.S. as a whole, China and Germany, Newsom's office announced last week.",

      "Critics have tied past population decreases in the Golden State to the relentless homelessness crisis and rising cost of living. California has some of the highest housing, gas and utility prices in the country.",
      "\u201cCalifornians are still leaving because of high costs, bad policies, and a government that punishes work and rewards dysfunction,\" Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher said. \"If the Governor thinks a one-year bump means the state\u2019s doing fine, he\u2019s ignoring the reality most families are living in.\u201d",
      "Eric McGhee, a policy director and senior fellow at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said the period of decline was significant because prior to it, \u201cin our entire existence as a state, we had never lost population before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were often one of the fastest-growing states,\" he said. \"So it was unusual for us to be losing population, to say the least.\u201d",
      "The growth California saw in 2024 \"is still very modest,\" McGhee said.",
      "The state also revised its estimate for legal immigration into California from other countries from 2021 to 2024 by roughly 277,000 people, citing better data. The estimated total number of legal immigrants during that period now stands at about 655,000, the Department of Finance said.",
      "Seven of the 10 largest cities saw an increase in population in 2024, including Bakersfield and San Diego, which both grew by more than 1% to roughly 419,000 and 1.4 million, respectively. San Francisco, San Jose and Anaheim saw decreases in population by less than 0.5%.",
      "The population rose in nine of the 10 largest counties, with Los Angeles County increasing by 28,000 compared to 2023. In Contra Costa, the state\u2019s ninth most populous county that is part of the San Francisco Bay Area, the number of residents fell by just two dozen.",

      "President Donald Trump is set to address graduating students at the University of Alabama",
      "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump was set to address graduating students at the University of Alabama on Thursday, a visit that drew hundreds of protesters to an off-campus rally.",
      "Trump\u2019s evening remarks in Tuscaloosa will be the Republican president\u2019s first address to graduates in his second term and will come as he has been celebrating the first 100 days of his administration. The visit came shortly after he announced a shake-up to his national security team, with Mike Waltz being tapped for United Nations ambassador and Secretary of State Marco Rubio taking over Waltz's national security adviser role on an interim basis.",
      "The White House offered no details about Trump\u2019s planned message to graduates.",
      "Alabama, where Trump won a commanding 64% of the vote in 2024, is where he has staged a number of his trademark large rallies over the past decade. It is also where Trump showed early signs of strength in his first presidential campaign when he began filling stadiums for his rallies.",
      "While Trump has described the speech as a commencement address, it is actually a special event that was created before graduation ceremonies that begin Friday. Graduating students have the option of attending the event.",
      "Former Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban is also speaking.",
      "Ahead of the president's arrival, cap-and-gown-wearing graduates and their families began filing into the arena where Trump was set to speak. Many seemed excited about the prospect of seeing him in person.",
      "Emily Appel, a 22-year-old advertising major from Norcross, Georgia, called Trump's appearance at their school \u201ca cherry on top\u201d of her college years.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s such an honor, no matter who the president is. I think this is a huge honor to have the president of the United States speaking to our school,\" Appel said.",
      "She called Trump a \u201cvery influential person\u201d and said she hoped he had a message to share that was \"positive about us being able to work in the real world and for our future.\u201d",
      "Sophie Best, who is graduating with a communications degree, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that we could have had a greater person come to speak.\"",
      "The 21-year-old from Cartersville, Georgia, said she attended Trump's first presidential inauguration in 2017 when she was a freshman in high school, along with her father, who she said loves Trump.",
      "\u201cI think that no matter what political party or whatever you believe in, I think that it\u2019s super cool that we get to experience and make history and be a part of this,\u201d she said.",
      "At a park several miles away, hundreds of people gathered at a counter rally hosted by College Democrats. One-time presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, the last Democrat to hold statewide office in Alabama, were slated to address the rally, called a \u201cTide Against Trump\u201d \u2014 a play on the university\u2019s nickname.",
      "Aidan Meyers, a 21-year-old junior studying biology at the university, said he felt betrayed by the decision to let Trump speak at a graduation-related event.",
      "\u201cI felt betrayed that the university was willing to put up with someone who has made it clear that they hate academia, essentially holding funding above universities' heads as a bargaining chip, unless they bow down to what he wants, which is kind of a hallmark sign with fascist regime,\u201d Meyers said.",
      "He said he also feels betrayed by the administration\u2019s stance on science and research. A fellowship he was seeking at the National Institutes of Health was canceled because of the federal hiring freeze, he said.",
      "Jones told the crowd they were there \u201cnot just as a protest, but as a movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are here today because you\u2019re concerned, you\u2019re afraid. You understand that this country\u2019s great democracy is teetering right now with what we\u2019re seeing going on,\u201d the former senator said.",
      "He said Trump asked to come to Alabama because he mistakenly thinks, \u201cy\u2019all are all my people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, obviously they\u2019re not,\u201d Jones told the large cheering crowd.",
      "Ahead of the rally, O'Rourke praised the students who invited him as \u201cinspiring\u201d and said their efforts in a Republican-dominated state like Alabama are an example for the rest of the country.",
      "\u201cYou cannot be too red or too rural or too Republican to be written off right now. You also can't be too blue or too liberal to be taken for granted,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told The Associated Press after arriving in Tuscaloosa. \u201cYou've got to show up absolutely everywhere. We truly are in crisis.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s presence has also drawn criticism from the Alabama NAACP, which said his policies are hurting universities and students, particularly students of color.",
      "Trump's visit to Alabama is his second trip this week. He held a rally in Michigan on Tuesday to mark 100 days in office.",
      "Outside of weekend trips for personal visits, the president has not made many official trips since taking office on Jan. 20. He usually speaks to the public from the impromptu news conferences he holds in the Oval Office and at other events at the White House.",
      "After his stop in Alabama, Trump is scheduled to travel to Florida for a long weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort.",
      "Later this month, he is scheduled to give the commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York.",

      "The Trump administration is calling for more reliance on behavioral therapy for transgender youth instead of broader gender-affirming medical care",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration released a lengthy review of transgender health care on Thursday that advocates for a greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming medical care for youths with gender dysmorphia.",
      "The Health and Human Services report questions standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and is likely to be used to bolster the government\u2019s abrupt shift in how to care for a subset of the population that has become a political lightning rod.",
      "This new \u201cbest practices\u201d report is in response to an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19.",
      "\u201cOur duty is to protect our nation\u2019s children \u2014 not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,\u201d National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. \u201cWe must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.\u201d",
      "HHS said its report, however, is not clinical guidance and does not make any policy recommendations. The report is also limited to children and does not address treatment for adults.",
      "Gender-affirming care for transgender youth under standards widely used in the U.S. includes supportive talk therapy and can \u2014 but does not always \u2014 involve puberty blockers or hormone treatment. Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender minors are rare.",
      "A judge has blocked key parts of Trump\u2019s order, which includes denying research and educational grants for medical schools, hospitals and other institutions that provide gender-affirming care to people 18 or younger. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care. The White House said Monday that since Trump took office, HHS has eliminated 215 grants totaling $477 million for research or education on gender-affirming treatment.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have also adopted bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling is pending after justices heard arguments in December in a case about whether states can enforce such laws.",
      "The Jan. 28 executive order is among several administration policies aimed at denying the existence of transgender people. Trump also has ordered the government to identify people as either male or female rather than accept a concept of gender in which people fall along a spectrum, remove transgender service members from the military, and bar transgender women and girls from sports competitions that align with their gender. This month, HHS issued guidance to protect whistleblowers who report doctors or hospitals providing gender-affirming care. Judges are blocking enforcement of several of the policies.",
      "This latest HHS report, which Trump called for while campaigning last year, represents a reversal in federal policy. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS, found that no research had determined that behavioral health interventions could change someone\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation. The 2023 update to the 2015 finding is no longer on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "The administration says this new report will go through a peer-review process. In the meantime, it\u2019s not saying who contributed to it, \u201cin order to help maintain the integrity of this process.\u201d",
      "The report says that medical groups have relied on medical treatment rather than behavioral therapy for transgender youth partly because of a \u201cmischaracterization of such approaches as \u2018conversion therapy,\u2019\u201d which about half the states have banned for minors.",
      "The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has said that evidence shows conversion therapies inflict harm on young people, including elevated rates of suicidal ideation. And the American Medical Association has urged states not to ban gender-affirming care for minors, saying that \u201cempirical evidence has demonstrated that trans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.\u201d",

      "Federal officials are planning to move forward with the closure of thousands of acres of U.S. Forest Service land in central Oregon where dozens of people have been living in homeless camps",
      "BEND, Ore. -- The U.S. Forest Service on Thursday is set to evict dozens of homeless people living in an encampment in a federal forest in central Oregon.",
      "The federal agency has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes National Forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, said Jesse Rabinowitz, spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center.",
      "People who refuse to leave could face one year in jail, $5,000 in fines or both, Rabinowitz said.",
      "He said it will be the Trump administration's first significant homeless encampment eviction. It also comes on May Day, which commemorates the struggles of the working class for fair wages and better working conditions around the globe.",
      "Four people living in the encampment, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane has yet to issue a written opinion, but the federal court posted on its docket Tuesday that the restraining order was denied, The Bulletin reported.",
      "Up to 200 people were living in the forest several months ago when they were told that the forest area would be closed May 1, Rabinowitz said.",
      "Local homeless advocate and retired attorney Chuck Hemingway, who filed the claims, told the newspaper he estimated 80 people remained there as of Friday, and at least 40 would likely still be there on May 1.",
      "Chris Daggett, who lives in the forest, told KTVZ-TV this week that his family has been in Bend for several generations and that living in the forest doesn't make him or anyone else a bad person.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to get back on your feet once you\u2019ve been knocked down,\u201d Daggett said. \"If they force us out on May 1, we still won\u2019t have anywhere else to go. It\u2019ll just make it even tougher for us to rebuild our lives.\u201d",
      "The Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares) of the forest, is prompting the closure. The goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes National Forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year.",
      "Deschutes National Forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the government\u2019s goal is \u201cvoluntary compliance,\u201d but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and \u201cenforce the closure and ensure public safety.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. defense officials say the number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year and there was a significant drop in the Army",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of sexual assaults reported across the U.S. military dipped by nearly 4% last year, fueled by a significant drop in the Army, The Associated Press has learned. It was the second year in a row with a decrease, reversing a troubling trend that has plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade.",
      "Senior U.S. defense officials said that while the decline is a good sign, the number of reported assaults is still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime.",
      "According to the officials, there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023. In 2022, there were 8,942 reported sexual assaults, a spike that triggered widespread alarm and led to new programs and an infusion of funding to try to combat the problem.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not been publicly released.",
      "According to data obtained by the AP, the overall decrease was due to a 13% drop in reported sexual assaults across the Army, which is the largest military service.",
      "All the other services saw increases. The Navy had the largest jump of 4.3%, while the Air Force had a 2.2% increase and the Marine Corps rose by less than 1%.",
      "Of the 8,195 total, there were 512 service members who reported an assault that happened before they entered the military. The Pentagon encourages reporting so that victims can get any support they need. In addition, 641 were civilians who said they were assaulted by a member of the military.",
      "While reported assaults decreased, the number of sexual harassment complaints went from 2,980 in 2023 to 3,014 last year. Most were filed by female service members, and the vast majority of those accused were male.",
      "The latest report also reflects the first full year since new prosecution procedures have been in place, putting independent lawyers in charge of those decisions and sidelining commanders after years of pressure from Congress.",
      "The change, long resisted by Pentagon leaders, was finally forced by frustrated lawmakers who believed that too often commanders would fail to take victims\u2019 complaints seriously or would try to protect alleged perpetrators in their units.",
      "Officials said it is too soon to tell what effect those changes are having on the prosecution process.",
      "The number of cases in which misconduct was substantiated increased a bit last year over the 2023 total. The number of discharges and administrative actions against alleged perpetrators continued to increase, and court-martial charges declined \u2014 both trends going back several years.",
      "Officials noted that nearly three-quarters of the court-martial cases ended in convictions, a slight increase over the previous year.",
      "Sexual assault reports in the military have gone up for much of the past decade, except for a tiny decrease in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Officials say they are optimistic about the recent decreases but say much more work needs to be done.",
      "While it is difficult to point to any one reason for the two-year decline, the Defense Department has been making a series of changes over the past year that officials say may be contributing to the shift. The services are using an infusion of more than $1 billion to improve programs and hire up to 2,500 personnel as part of a new \u201cprevention workforce\u201d and place them at military installations around the world.",
      "So far, about 1,400 have been hired for that work, but that process has stalled this year due to the Trump administration\u2019s budget and personnel cuts across the federal government. Defense officials said they are working to spread the existing workers around to lessen the gaps until more can be hired.",
      "The Pentagon releases a report every year on the number of sexual assaults reported by or about troops. But because sexual assault is a highly underreported crime, the department also does a confidential survey every two years to get a clearer picture of the problem. That survey, which is conducted online, came out last year, so it was not done this year.",
      "Last year\u2019s survey said more than 29,000 active-duty service members said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the previous year, compared with nearly 36,000 in the 2021 survey, according to several defense officials. The decrease was the first in eight years.",
      "But officials said the survey also indicates that a large number of service members never file a report.",
      "Defense officials have long argued that an increase in reported assaults is a positive trend because so many people are reluctant to report them, both in the military and in society as a whole. Greater reporting, they say, shows there is more confidence in the reporting system and greater comfort with the support for victims.",

      "STARKE, Fla. -- An Army combat veteran whose Gulf War experience triggered severe mental problems was executed Thursday evening in Florida for the 1998 shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children.",
      "Jeffrey Hutchinson, 62, was pronounced dead at 8:15 p.m. following a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. He was the fourth person executed this year in the state under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, with a fifth execution set for May 15.",
      "Hutchinson had no last statement but appeared to be mumbling to himself as the procedure started just before 8 p.m. His legs shook sporadically, and he seemed to have body spasms for several minutes and then was still. The process took a little more than 15 minutes.",
      "The execution was carried out soon after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal without comment.",
      "Hutchinson had long claimed that he was innocent and that two unknown assailants perpetrated the killings under a U.S. government conspiracy aimed at silencing his activism on claims including Gulf War illnesses involving veterans. Hutchinson served eight years in the Army, part of it as an elite Ranger.",
      "Court records, however, showed that on the night of the killings in Crestview, Hutchinson argued with his girlfriend, 32-year-old Renee Flaherty, then packed his clothes and guns into a truck. Hutchinson went to a bar and drank some beer, telling staff there that Flaherty was angry with him before leaving abruptly.",
      "A short time later, a male caller told a 911 operator, \u201cI just shot my family\u201d from the house Hutchinson and Flaherty shared with the three children: 9-year-old Geoffrey, 7-year-old Amanda, and 4-year-old Logan. All were killed with a 12-gauge shotgun that was found on a kitchen counter. Hutchinson was located by police in the garage with a phone still connected to the 911 center and gunshot residue on his hands.",
      "Darran Johnson, the brother of Renee Flaherty, said after the execution that justice was done but the family\u2019s pain will never end.",
      "\u201cNot a day goes by that we don\u2019t think about the loved ones that were taken from us,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "At his 2001 trial, Hutchinson\u2019s defense was based on his claim that two unknown men came to the house and killed Flaherty and the children after he struggled with them. A jury found him guilty of four counts of first-degree murder, and he received life in prison for Flaherty\u2019s killing and three death sentences for the children.",
      "Hutchinson filed numerous unsuccessful appeals, many focused on mental health problems linked to his Army service. In late April his lawyers sought to delay his execution by claiming he was insane and therefore could not be put to death.",
      "Bradford County Circuit Judge James Colaw rejected that argument in an April 27 order.",
      "\u201cThis Court finds that Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s purported delusion is demonstrably false. Jeffrey Hutchinson does not lack the mental capacity to understand the reason for the pending execution,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "In their court filings, Hutchinson\u2019s lawyers said he suffered from Gulf War Illness \u2014 a series of health problems stemming from the 1990-1991 war in Iraq \u2014 as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia related to his claim that he was targeted by government surveillance.",
      "Florida\u2019s lethal injection protocol uses a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",
      "So far this year, 15 people have been put to death in the U.S. including Hutchinson.",
      "A fifth Florida execution is scheduled May 15 for Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing a woman at a motel in 1997. Rogers also was convicted of another woman\u2019s murder in California and is believed by investigators to have killed others around the country.",

      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has denied the U.S. government's request to release a former FBI informant while he appeals his case",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A federal judge has denied the U.S. government's request to release from prison a former FBI informant who made up a story about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter accepting bribes that later became central to Republicans\u2019 impeachment effort.",
      "The decision, issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles, comes weeks after a new prosecutor reassigned to Alexander Smirnov's case jointly filed a motion with his attorneys asking for his release while he appeals his conviction. In the motion, the U.S. government had said it would review its \u201ctheory of the case.\u201d",
      "Wright said in his written order that Smirnov is still flight risk, even if prosecutors say they will review his case.",
      "\"The fact remains that Smirnov has been convicted and sentenced to seventy-two months in prison, providing ample incentive to flee,\" he said.",
      "Smirnov, 44, was sentenced in January after pleading guilty to tax evasion and lying to the FBI about the phony bribery scheme, which was described by the previous prosecutors assigned to the case as an effort to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "His attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, told The Associated Press in a text that they will appeal the judge's decision and \u201ccontinue to advocate for Mr. Smirnov's release.\u201d The U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles declined to comment.",
      "Smirnov had been originally prosecuted by former Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who resigned in January days before President Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second term.",
      "Smirnov has been in custody since February 2024. He was arrested at the Las Vegas airport after returning to the U.S. from overseas.",
      "Smirnov, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, falsely claimed to his FBI handler that around 2015, executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid then-Vice President Biden and his son $5 million each.",
      "The explosive claim in 2020 came after Smirnov expressed \"bias\u201d about Biden as a presidential candidate, according to prosecutors at the time. In reality, investigators found Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting in 2017 \u2014 after Biden's term as vice president.",
      "Authorities said Smirnov's false claim \u201cset off a firestorm in Congress\u201d when it resurfaced years later as part of the House impeachment inquiry into Biden, who won the presidency over Trump in 2020. The Biden administration dismissed the impeachment effort as a \u201cstunt.\u201d",
      "Weiss also brought gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden, who was supposed to be sentenced in December after being convicted at a trial in the gun case and pleading guilty to tax charges. But he was pardoned by his father, who said he believed \u201craw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court says it won't lift restrictions on the access that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has to Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans.",
      "The full panel of judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 9-6 to keep the ruling from U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in place while DOGE pushes forward with an appeal. The appellate decision was released Wednesday.",
      "Earlier this month Hollander issued a preliminary injunction in the case, which was brought by a group of labor unions and retirees who allege DOGE\u2019s recent actions violate privacy laws and present massive information security risks.",
      "Hollander said DOGE staffers could access data that has been redacted or stripped of anything personally identifiable, but only if they undergo training and background checks. She also said DOGE and its staffers must purge any of the non-anonymized Social Security data they have already obtained, and barred them from making any changes to the computer code used by the Social Security Administration.",
      "Attorneys representing DOGE had argued that anonymizing the data would be too burdensome, and disrupt the Trump administration's efforts to root out any Social Security fraud.",
      "Appellate Judge Robert B. King, writing for the majority, said DOGE wants \u201cimmediate and unfettered access\u201d to all Social Security records, including \u201cthe highly sensitive personal information of essentially everyone in our Country,\u201d like family court and school records, mental health and medical records of SSA disability recipients, and bank and earning information.",
      "\u201cAll this highly sensitive information has long been handed over to SSA by the American people with every reason to believe that the information would be fiercely protected,\u201d King wrote.",
      "Appellate judge Julius Richardson, who voted against the majority ruling, said the case should have been handled by a smaller three-judge group rather than the full panel of active appellate judges. He also said the plaintiffs haven't shown DOGE has actually snooped on any of their personal information, but instead are distressed by the possibility of \u201cabstract harm.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump family company has struck a deal for a luxury golf resort in Qatar",
      "The Trump family company struck a deal Wednesday to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar in a sign it has no plans to hold back from foreign dealmaking during a second Trump administration, despite the danger of a president shaping U.S. public policy for personal financial gain.",
      "The project, which features Trump-branded beachside villas and an 18-hole golf course to be built by a Saudi Arabian company, is the first foreign deal by the Trump Organization since Donald Trump took office and unlike any done in his first term. Back then, he forswore foreign deals in an extraordinary press conference surrounded by stacks of legal documents as he pledged to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest.",
      "Noah Bookbinder, president of a watchdog group that has sued Trump for alleged ethics violations, blasted the Qatari deal.",
      "\u201cYou want a president making decisions that are in the best interest of the United States, not his bottom line,\u201d said Bookbinder, who leads Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "In addition to a Saudi Arabian partner, called Dar Global, the planned resort north of the Qatari capital of Doha will be developed by a Qatari company called Qatari Diar, which is owned by the Qatari government. That would appear to violate the Trump Organization\u2019s much weaker, second-term ethics pledge that, while it would pursue foreign deals, none would include foreign governments.",
      "When asked for clarification, the Trump Organization said its deal was with the Saudi firm, not the Qatari one, though Trump's son Eric, who is in charge of the business, mentioned both companies in an earlier statement.",
      "\u201cWe are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal Wednesday for the Trump International Golf Club and Trump Villas is unlikely to be the last of its kind. It follows several other deals made before Trump was sworn in, including one for a golf resort in Vietnam late last year with a firm with ties to the Communist Party.",
      "The deals have drawn outrage from government watchdogs but mostly silence from Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress.",
      "The Associated Press reached out to the two Republicans who chair the foreign relations committees in the Senate and House, Sen. James Risch of Idaho and Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, but neither responded.",
      "Any deal with Saudi Arabia is seen as especially problematic in foreign policy circles. Trump\u2019s close ties to Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, drew heavy criticism in his first term after the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist for The Washington Post who had written critically about the monarchy.",
      "Khashoggi is believed to have been dismembered, a killing that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was approved by the crown prince.",
      "The deal on Wednesday with the Saudi firm Dar Global, a London-based international arm of developer Dar Al Arkan, follows deals with it for two Riyadh projects in December. Dar Global is not owned by the Saudi government, but it has close ties to the royal Saudi family.",
      "Another government tie to Trump is through his son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund has reportedly invested $2 billion in an investment fund run by Kushner. And the Saudi government-backed LIV Golf has hosted tournaments at Trump's Doral resort near Miami.",
      "Despite Trump's pledge in his first term to not make moves that would appear to conflict with his personal financial holdings and business, he ended up opening the doors to all sorts of potential pay-to-play deals. His hotel down the street from the White House hosted scores of corporate lobbyists, CEOs, members of Congress and diplomats. Trump once suggested holding a G7 meeting of global leaders at Doral before he backed down after an outcry over ethics concerns.",
      "Several lawsuits were filed against the first Trump administration, alleging it violated the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which bans a president from accepting gifts or payments from foreign or domestic governments. One case was appealed to the Supreme Court but was never heard because Trump had already left the presidency at that point and the issue was moot.",
      "This time, the hotel is gone, sold to a Miami investment firm, but other sources of potential conflicts of interest have emerged.",
      "The Trump Organization also owns much of the publicly traded parent company of social media platform Truth Social, which allows Trump to financially benefit from traffic to the site where his postings as U.S. president are widely followed. The family also has a stake in a cybercurrency trading platform called World Liberty Financial as Trump has pushed for less regulatory oversight on cybercurrencies.",

    "summary": "The de minimis exemption was key to the huge growth of the Chinese online retailers.",
    "story": [
      "A duty-free loophole for low-value packages has been closed by President Donald Trump, pushing up prices for US customers of firms like Shein and Temu.",
      "The Chinese online retail giants relied on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.",
      "Supporters of the loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (\u00a3600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.",
      "But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.",
      "What was the de minimis exemption?",
      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",
      "In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.",
      "In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.",
      "Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).",
      "Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu benefited greatly from the loophole.",
      "Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices",
      "And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.",
      "Shein and Temu did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.",
      "However last month, in almost identical statements, the rival companies said they have seen operating expenses rise \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\", adding they will make \"price adjustments\" from 25 April.",
      "Why has Trump closed the loophole?",
      "In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.",
      "The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.",
      "During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.",
      "It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages \"to exploit the de minimis exemption\".",
      "\"These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,\" it added.",

      "How Temu is shaking up the world of online shopping",
      "The rise and rise of fashion giant Shein",
      "The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop \"abuse\" of the exemption.",
      "\"The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,\" it said.",
      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers saw prices rise.",
      "Shein and Temu put up prices for their US customers ahead of the 2 May deadline \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".",
      "The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in \"$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers\".",
      "Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.",
      "In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.",
      "In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\".",
      "The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3127.50; $169.35).",
      "Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.",
      "Will US border checks change?",
      "Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.",
      "Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.",
      "There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.",
      "According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would \"shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.\"",
      "\"CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,\" it added."

    "summary": "Weather influencers can provide useful local information but are also accused of exaggerating conditions.",
    "story": [
      "As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to.",
      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",
      "Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.",
      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "\"Sometimes I can stand in line and hear people talking about the page, and they have no idea that I'm right there. It all adds to the fun.\"",

      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating the sector, looking at whether a lack of competition in the sector has contributed to soaring prices.",
      "Prices for treatments grew by 60% between 2015 and 2023, compared with inflation of 35% for other general services, according to CMA research.",
      "The regulator is also pushing for more transparency as part of the overhaul due to be finalised in the coming months.",
      "In addition to the price caps, the CMA is looking into a ban on bonuses linked to offering specific treatments.",
      "It said on Thursday that it would look into a ban on any policies that would curtail vets' \"clinical freedom\".",
      "The watchdog also found there was a lack of transparency around the cost of treatments and what choices were available.",
      "It found that businesses were marking up medicine prices, sometimes by as much as four times the purchase cost.",
      "In a list of potential remedies, the CMA said vets could be forced to create a clear online display of prices for medicines, surgeries, treatments and out-of-hours help. The working paper also suggested that the mark-up charged on pet cremations, sold to customers at a \"vulnerable moment\", might be capped.",
      "The watchdog has also suggested a comparison website making it compulsory for clinics to inform owners if cheaper options are available.",
      "Last month, a BBC investigation found that some vets felt they were under pressure to \"generate income\".",
      "The BBC spoke to vets working for IVC, which owns more than 900 surgeries, who all say they are monitored and set targets by the company.",
      "IVC said the interests of the pets was always the first priority.",
      "The CMA expects to release a provisional report on what measures it will take in the summer months, with a final decision by November.",
      "The CMA said basic local vet services are worth \u00a32bn-\u00a32.5bn a year, but when other aspects such as cremation, specialist treatments and medicines are taken into account, the overall value of the industry is estimated at \u00a35.7bn a year.",
      "The competition body highlighted how the sector was increasingly being dominated by larger firms and how this might be reducing consumer choice.",
      "There are about 5,000 vet practices in the UK, it said, but since 2013, approximately 1,500 of these have been acquired by six large corporate groups.",
      "They are CVS, Independent Vetcare Ltd, Linnaeus, Medivet, Pets at Home and VetPartners.",
      "Four of these six tend to retain the name and branding of an independently-owned practice when they buy it, which the CMA said may create an \"illusion of competition\" for consumers if they are trying to shop around to find alternative practices."

    "summary": "The tech giant had been ordered in 2021 to allow greater competition and open the App Store up to outside payment options.",
    "story": [
      "A US district judge has found Apple wilfully violated her injunction in a case brought by Epic Games - and that a top Apple executive \"outright lied\" under oath.",
      "The injunction was supposed to block Apple from anti-competitive conduct and pricing, opening the App Store up to outside payment options.",
      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said she was referring the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate whether a criminal contempt proceeding is appropriate.",
      "In response, an Apple spokesperson said: \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\"",
      "Wednesday's judgement refers to a 2021 case brought by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, one of the world's most popular games, which argued that third-party payment options should be available to customers.",
      "It challenged the up-to-30% cut Apple takes from purchases - and argued that the App Store was monopolistic.",

      "Apple dealt major blow in Epic Games trial",
      "In her 2021 judgement, Judge Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple could no longer prohibit developers linking to their own purchasing mechanisms.",
      "As well as game purchasing, another example of how this would work is a movie-streaming service being able to tell customers to subscribe via its own website, without using Apple's in-app purchasing mechanism.",
      "In a contempt order issued Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple nevertheless continued to interfere with competition with attempts that the court stated \"will not be tolerated\".",
      "Judge Gonzalez Rogers added that internal company documents she reviewed showed Apple deliberately violated the injunction.",
      "The documents reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",
      "She said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with the injunction and allowed CFO Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "She also said Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman \"outright lied under oath\".",
      "The judge wrote that one example of Apple's attempts to evade the injunction included a decision to charge a 27% commission on off-app purchases, when it had previously charged nothing.",
      "The company also imposed new barriers and requirements to discourage customers from using competing purchasing platforms, she said.",
      "In a post on X, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said his company would return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week and offered an olive branch to his long-time rival.",
      "\"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return 'Fortnite' to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,\" Sweeney wrote.",

    "story": [
      "\"We don't care about sales to the United States,\" says Hu Tianqiang as one of his toy fighter jets flies past our heads.",
      "It's hard to hear him above the buzzing toy planes and miniature drones, an almost rhythmic backdrop to the cacophony of toys that surround him, all clamouring for the attention of buyers.",
      "Hu's stall, Zhongxiang Toys, sits inside the world's biggest wholesale market in the small Chinese city of Yiwu.",
      "It's a huge showroom of more than 75,000 shops where buyers come seeking just about everything, from twinkling Christmas lights and kitchenware to umbrellas and massage guns. It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show.",
      "Yiwu is in the province of Zhejiang, along China's eastern coast. The manufacturing and export hub, home to more than 30 ports, accounted for 17% of all Chinese sales to the US last year.",
      "That puts Yiwu, and this region, at the frontline of the US-China trade war.",
      "Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war",
      "Five cards China holds in a trade war with the US",
      "Mr Hu, too, is on the frontline. He sits among rows of snazzy toy jets, squeaking dogs, fluffy stuffed animals, barbies and motorcycle-riding spidermen \u2013 a sliver of the $34bn (\u00a325bn) worth of toys China exported in 2024.",
      "About $10bn of it went to the US. But now, these Chinese exports to America face up to 245% tariffs. And US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he blames Beijing in particular for cornering too much of the global market.",
      "But things have changed here since Trump's first trade war against China, which kicked off in 2018. It taught Yiwu a lesson, summed up by Mr Hu: \"Other countries have money too!\"",
      "That defiance has become a familiar theme in the world's second-biggest economy, which is bracing itself for another turbulent Trump presidency.",
      "Beijing, which has been repeatedly telling the world that the US was bullying countries into trade negotiations, has not backed down yet from the trade war.",
      "The propaganda online has ratcheted up, applauding Chinese innovation and diplomacy in contrast to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump. On the country's highly controlled social media, there are plenty of posts echoing the leadership's promise that China will keep fighting.",
      "And in factories and markets, businessmen and exporters now say they have other alternatives, beyond Trump's America. Mr Hu, for instance, says around 20%-30% of his business came from US buyers. But not anymore.",
      "\"We don't care about that 20-30%,\" Mr Hu says. \"We now sell mostly to South America and the Middle East. We are not lacking money, we are rich.\"",
      "When we ask about Trump, his colleague Chen Lang jumps in, rolling his eyes: \"He's cracking international jokes like no other. One day, one joke. Adding tariffs for him is like cracking a joke.\"",
      "Nearby, one of the thousands of buyers that flock to this market every day is negotiating a price to buy more than 100 robots that turn into cars in a series of beeps and buzzes. After tapping various numbers into a calculator, the final price is written in chalk on the floor.",
      "The buyer, we are told, is from Dubai. The BBC met many others from across Africa and South America.",
      "Lin Xiupeng says he has noticed the shift away from American buyers in his last 10 years in the toy business.",
      "\"A few days ago, the shop next to us had an order from a US client. It's worth more than one million yuan. But because of tariffs, the shop owner decided to cancel it,\" he says, offering us cups of tea.",
      "\"They must need China,\" he says, adding that the country supplies most of America's toys.",
      "\"I think there are a lot of businesses in the US protesting these days.\"",
      "Mr Lin is correct. Some toy shop owners in the US have written to the White House describing the tariffs as \"disastrous\" for their business.",
      "\"The tariffs are taking a hatchet to small businesses across America,\" Jonathan Cathey, who owns a toy company in Los Angeles, told the BBC over the phone.",
      "He invested his last $500 in his company, Loyal Subjects, in 2009, which he ran from his two-bedroom bungalow in West Hollywood. He says it's now a multi-million-dollar business, but the tariffs could derail his plans.",
      "\"The entire toy industry could go under. We are looking at the total implosion of the supply chain. It's going to get really ugly,\" he warns.",
      "He says swapping suppliers is a huge task: \"You need a lot of resources on the ground to produce a toy and many of these Chinese businesses have spent 40 years perfecting their craft.\"",
      "Trump's crusade",
      "China has been a big part of Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with his administration going head-to-head with Beijing.",
      "\"He seems to be launching a crusade against the whole world,\" says former Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, who served in the People's Liberation Army. \"But of course he's trying to bash China the hardest.\"",
      "Trump accused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic.",
      "And, of course, he initiated another trade war, which takes special aim at China's neighbours, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, that have been crucial to its evolving supply chain.",
      "In the last week, he suggested the levies on Chinese goods could be halved and spoke of \"a fair deal with China\" that his administration was \"actively\" negotiating.",
      "But China's Commerce Ministry rebuffed this as \"groundless with no factual basis\". The headlines in state media haven't spared him either:  \"Trump is probably the worst president in American history,\" read one on state TV.",
      "It seems the US president is waiting for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to pick up the phone.",
      "\"We in China say \u2013 we have to let the bullet fly for a moment,\" Col Zhou says. \"That means in the fog of war, we do not know what will come next. I believe this kind of tit-for-tat would last for maybe one or two months \u2013 hopefully not more than three months.\"",
      "It cannot go on, he adds, because that would not be good.",
      "It's certainly not good for China. Trump's tariffs are not even the biggest challenge facing the country, which is also grappling with domestic economic pain, from low consumption to a housing crisis that has dented people's savings and confidence in the future.",
      "The terrible timing aside, the tariffs are biting Chinese businesses.",
      "Goldman Sachs has forecast that China's economy will grow by 4.5% this year, short of the government's target: 5%.",
      "The BBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhou in mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed.",
      "When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.",
      "The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.",
      "Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.",
      "Opportunities beyond America",
      "The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand \u2013 think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.",
      "Walmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas.",
      "Some 90% of all Christmas decorations hung around American homes come from Yiwu in China, where sellers, surrounded by signs wishing the world \"Feliz Navidad\" told us they're now trying to focus on sales to South America.",
      "And that effort is very evident in Yiwu.",
      "In the early morning, before the shutters even open, the cavernous lobby of the wholesale market echoes with voices reciting key phrases.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of losing hot water or heating when their old type of electricity meter goes out of action.",
      "Energy companies have said it will be \"very, very difficult\" to replace all Radio Teleswitching System (RTS) meters with smart meters before the old technology is switched off on 30 June.",
      "Most homes have standard meters and will not be affected whether they have a smart meter or not. But campaigners estimate more than 300,000 homes have the old RTS meters and could lose heating - or have it stuck on constantly.",
      "The government said the industry had to \"work urgently to continue to increase the pace of replacements\".",
      "Since the 1980s, RTS meters have used a longwave radio frequency to switch between peak and off peak rates.",
      "The technology is becoming obsolete and energy companies have a deadline to change their customers' meters by 30 June.",
      "At the end of March, there were still 430,000 households using RTS meters for their heating and hot water, according to Energy UK, which represents energy companies.",
      "It said more than 1,000 RTS meters were now being replaced each day.",
      "But based on the 430,000 figure, this daily rate would need to be more like 5,000 to stand a chance of reaching everyone.",

      "Concern old meters still in use ahead of switch off",
      "Panorama: The Truth about Smart Meters",
      "How do smart meters work and are they compulsory?",
      "Ned Hammond, Energy UK's deputy director for customers, told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours the rate of replacement was rising, but added: \"Obviously we'd need to increase from there significantly still to replace all the meters by the end of June.\"",
      "Asked whether it was impossible to get every RTS meter switched over by 30 June, he said: \"I wouldn't want to say impossible - but clearly very, very difficult to get to that point.\"",
      "Simon Francis, from campaign group the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the Energy UK figures suggested more than 300,000 households could be left with a meter that doesn't work from 1 July.",
      "He added: \"With pressures on the replacement programme growing and with limited engineer availability, especially in rural areas, there's a real risk of prolonged disruption, particularly for vulnerable households.\"",
      "RTS meters typically control heating and hot water on a separate circuit to the rest of the household's electricity, so things like plug sockets and lights are unlikely to be affected by the switch-off, energy watchdog Ofgem said.",
      "The RTS network was originally planned to be switched off in March 2024, but this was extended to give energy companies more time to get through everyone.",
      "Energy companies are still targeting 30 June \"as things stand\", Mr Hammond added, and are developing plans for a \"managed and very careful phase down of the system\", aiming to protect vulnerable customers.",
      "'I don't want a smart meter'",
      "One challenge of changing everyone on to the new system is a distrust of smart meters. The BBC has previously found that smart meters can sometimes give inaccurate readings and can work worse or better depending on where you live.",
      "Mr Hammond said this reluctance was \"definitely a challenge\" but that smart meters meant more visible bills, not having to do manual readings, and benefiting from different tariffs.",
      "Jane from Norfolk told the BBC she is on an RTS meter and does not want a smart meter but feels as if she is being forced into getting one. She is currently on an Economy 7 tariff and does not want to switch.",
      "\"It's not yet lawful to say I've got to have one. And I really, really don't want one. I'm perfectly happy with the way things are,\" she said.",
      "Diane Gray, who lives near Cockermouth in Cumbria, uses RTS to control the heating and hot water in her home on an Economy 7 tariff. She wants a smart meter but has been told one won't work in her house.",
      "In December, her supplier wrote to her to say: \"At the moment we're not able to install a new meter in your home that works with your current meter's heating set up. Please bear with us. We are working hard on a solution for your meter type.\"",
      "She's since received another notification that a smart meter will be fitted in early June.",
      "\"I've got no idea where it's going to leave us,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"It is very concerning. Because they're doing it in the summer, come the winter I keep thinking there must be some solution they're going to give us before we need to start using the heating.\"",
      "If your energy supplier cannot fit a smart meter in your home, Ofgem says your supplier must install a \"suitable meter\" with no disruption to your service.",
      "An government spokesperson said it was \"supporting Ofgem and energy suppliers to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible for consumers\".",

    "summary": "The world's largest economy contracted at an annual pace of 0.3% in the first three months of 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.",
      "The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",
      "The figures marked the first quarterly decline in three years, and came as the introduction of import taxes by President Donald Trump has scrambled global trade and created major uncertainty.",
      "But analysts said it would take more time to understand the impact of the tariff changes.",
      "While imports count against growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP), the surge is expected to be reversed in the months ahead. Those swings do not necessarily indicate an economy performing poorly.",
      "The report also showed consumer spending - the primary driver of the US economy - expanded 1.8%, though at a slower pace than in 2024.",
      "At a television appearance with cabinet members, Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic weakening, maintaining that his policies would drive investment in the US and an economic boom.",
      "\"This is Biden,\" he said, while appearing to dismiss bubbling fears of price increases, supply shocks and shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.",
      "\"Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"",
      "In a statement, the White House said the GDP figures were a \"backward-looking indicator\".",
      "\"The underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Since re-entering the White House in January, Trump has taken the business world by storm, announcing a series of new trade tariffs that he says will raise money for the government and help boost US manufacturing.",
      "While he has watered down some of the policies in face of domestic outcry, analysts say the measures still leave the US with the highest overall effective average tariff rate in more than 100 years.",
      "This report tracked activity through the end of March, a period before Trump announced his most far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on China and other countries around the world, which sparked a dramatic sell-off in the stock market and turmoil in currency and debt markets.",
      "It showed imports skyrocketed by more than 40% in the first three months of the year, while consumer spending grew 1.8%, down from 4% at the end of 2024.",
      "Analysts cautioned that those figures could be distorted by people pulling forward their purchases in anticipation of tariffs.",
      "The report also showed an unexpected jump in business investment, while final sales to private domestic purchasers - a closely watched indicator of overall demand - grew a solid 3%, little changed from the previous quarter.",
      "\"Overall, not as bad as feared,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "Tariffs are a tax on imports, which economists have warned will lead to higher prices.",
      "Some firms, such as toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker on Wednesday, have already announced plans to raise prices in response to the measures.",
      "If shoppers baulk at higher prices and demand falls as expected, it could dampen growth further.",
      "As corporate America enters a busy period of public updates for investors, many companies, including carmakers such as Stellantis and Mercedes, have said they cannot provide guidance about sales expectations for the months ahead, citing the uncertainty.",
      "Leading stock indexes in the US, which had recovered from steep losses as Trump rolled back on some of his plans, opened lower after the figures were published but ended the day roughly flat.",
      "But economists at Wells Fargo said it was difficult to draw firm conclusions from the latest data, noting that the drag on growth from trade was the biggest since the 1940s.",
      "\"The US economy is at a greater risk of recession today than it was even a month ago, but this contraction in GDP is not the start of one,\" they said.",

    "summary": "The slowdown in the market was expected due to the lowering of thresholds at which buyers need to start paying stamp duty.",
    "story": [
      "House prices fell in April as buyers faced paying thousands of pounds more in stamp duty, according to new figures from Nationwide.",
      "Prices were down 0.6% month-on-month, the building society said.",
      "The slowdown in the market was expected due to changes to stamp duty thresholds kicking in on 1 April.",
      "Annual house price growth also slowed, but homes remain 3.4% more expensive  than they were a year ago, with the average price now at \u00a3270,752.",
      "Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said there was a \"significant jump\" in transactions in March, with buyers bringing forward purchases to avoid the additional tax charges.",
      "\"The market is likely to remain a little soft in the coming months,\" he said.",
      "But Mr Gardner added buying was likely to pick up as over summer due to earnings rising and the expectation of further cuts to interest rates.",
      "Mortgages under 4% are back but dangers lurk for borrowers",
      "What is stamp duty and how is it changing?",
      "In her October Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the government had decided to lower stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "The changes, which came into effect in April, means house buyers now pay the tax on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000, as was the case previously.",
      "First-time buyers will also now have to pay stamp duty on homes costing more than \u00a3300,000, whereas before the April change, they did not have to pay the charge unless the property was above \u00a3425,000.",
      "Nationwide's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.",
      "April's drop in house prices was the biggest monthly fall since August 2023, according to UK economist Ashley Webb from Capital Economics.",
      "He said that the easing of mortgage rates would help boost housing demand in the coming months, offsetting any tightening in spending as a result of higher prices potentially caused by US president Donald Trump's trade tariffs.",
      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "Recent figures suggested that more low-deposit mortgages at 5% or 10% are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",
      "\"With the anticipation of further rate cuts and mortgage provider competition, we expect to see the market accelerate through the gears over the remainder of the year,\" said Jean Jameson, from estate agent Foxtons."

      "Growing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.",

      "\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"",
      "Border crossings, egg prices and jobs - Trump's 100 days speech fact-checked",
      "Trump eases car tariffs after firms raised concerns",
      "Alberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.",
      "In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.",
      "The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.",
      "\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.",
      "Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.",
      "He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.",
      "\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.",
      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",
      "Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.",
      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",
      "After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".",
      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",
      "The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.",
      "He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.",
      "While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.",
      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",
      "\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.",
      "While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.",
      "If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "Recent figures suggested that more low-deposit mortgages at 5% or 10% are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",
      "\"With the anticipation of further rate cuts and mortgage provider competition, we expect to see the market accelerate through the gears over the remainder of the year,\" said Jean Jameson, from estate agent Foxtons."

    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

      "Planned changes to school uniform policy will affect over four million pupils across England, according to new estimates from the Department for Education (DfE).",
      "The government says seven in 10 secondary schools and 35% of primary schools in England will have to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students.",
      "The new rule is part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming a law.",

      "The government claims parents will save around \u00a350 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.",
      "But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items.",

      "In Darlington town centre, one mum with two sons at primary school and a daughter in secondary said she was worried about the jump in uniform costs coming when her sons join secondary school.",
      "\"It's just a nightmare,\" she said.",

      "The school may cut back further if limits to branded items are brought in.",
      "The school is in an area of Halifax with high deprivation, and has a uniform bank as well as a laundrette to wash pupils' uniforms.",

      "\"There are so many different factors that children have to face in order to have clean and correct uniform that is used daily,\" he says.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

      "Sting and Trudie Styler had visited to watch the production, he added, as well as Slow Horses writer Mick Heron.",
      "Mr Hutchinson said the opening to the production featured 67-year-old Oldman silently eating fruit.",
      "\"It is interesting when you watch something and it's silent other than someone eating a banana and how it makes an audience feel,\" the critic said.",
      "\"Are they going to find it funny, do they have permission to give the first laugh?\"",
      "He added: \"He has absolute charisma on screen, but what's interesting here is he's playing a character who is downbeat and looking back on 30 years earlier.\"",
      "After his York debut, Oldman's glittering career has included playing Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films and winning a best actor Oscar in 2018 for his Winston Churchhill portrayal.",
      "Mr Hutchinson, 64, added: \"People say to me, why didn't you go to work in London? The answer is because still so much goes on in the north.",

    "story": [
      "To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.",
      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",
      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",
      "Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.",
      "In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.",
      "Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah\".",
      "They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.",
      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of \"as Gaeilge\" rap acts like Iml\u00e9 and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",

      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",

      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",

      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",

      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

      "The review into maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust, published in 2022, found that at least 201 babies and nine mothers could have survived with better care.",
      "Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by \u00a395m a year.",
      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",
      "But analysis of NHS funding for this year, carried out by the Health Service Journal, showed that just \u00a32m of the \u00a395m was to be ringfenced for 2025/26.",

      "If the ICBs decide to spend the money they've been allocated on maternity care, there won't be a funding cut.",

      "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years.",
      "Ellie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye that didn't go away, resulting in blurred vision. No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.",
      "It was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.",
      "\"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\"",
      "Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\".",
      "\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.",
      "In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.",
      "Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.",
      "\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.",
      "\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"",
      "The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.",
      "Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.",
      "\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"",
      "It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.",
      "Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.",
      "A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.",
      "Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.",
      "For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.",
      "However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.",
      "\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"",
      "Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".",
      "In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.",
      "It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.",
      "Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.",
      "\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says.",
      "\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"",
      "A single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.",
      "Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.",
      "These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.",
      "\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.",
      "It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.",
      "Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding.",
      "Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.",

      "In March 2023, Belfast City councillors passed a motion in favour of setting up a safe injecting facility to help prevent overdoses among drug users.",
      "The council has no legal power to open a facility and a change in legislation would be required for this to happen.",
      "The aim would be to reduce overdoses and drug-related harm as well as making drug use less visible to the community.",

      "Mr McNairney said there were other areas with \"more prominent use\" but getting needles off the street was always a positive.",
      "\"There are needles around the town anyway. By not putting the bins up they're not going to go away,\" he said.",
      "Mr McNairney said he had visited a safe injection site which opened in Dublin in 2024 and he was in favour of a similar facility in Belfast.",

      "The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to \"critical\" staff shortages among radiographers who specialise in this area.",
      "Sally Reed, 67, who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer, told the BBC that \"if something can save your life you should go for it\" - whether it's administered by a woman or man.",
      "Major breast cancer screening AI trial to begin",
      "Women urged to book breast screening appointments",
      "'I may not have been here today without mammogram'",
      "But Sally also admits women who already don't want to go for breast screening \"would definitely be turned off by a man\".",
      "Breast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.",
      "According to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.",
      "Among mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.",
      "It takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.",
      "Changes to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.",
      "Sue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.",
      "\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".",
      "Johnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.",
      "The prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.",
      "She says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.",
      "Ms Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.",
      "She's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.",
      "Because of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.",
      "But Claire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says \"it's vital that efforts to build up the screening workforce do not inadvertently damage uptake of breast screening\".",
      "She says that \"while we welcome every effort to reduce staff shortages and delays in breast screening, we know that concerns about being seen by a male mammographer already deter some women from attending breast screening, even with current staffing being all-female\".",
      "Ms Rowney adds that recruiting male mammographers could be an issue for some women in ethnic minority communities, who may have greater concerns around preserving their modesty and who may be less likely to take up the offer of screening."

      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

    "story": [
      "Campaigners have questioned Health Secretary Wes Streeting's commitment to maternity safety after his department watered down funding levels.",
      "Almost \u00a3100m was invested into improving maternity safety annually following the publication of an interim report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust. But changes by the Department of Health mean that just \u00a32m of the funding is guaranteed to be spent on maternity care this year.",
      "Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter due to poor care at the trust, called the decision \"an absolute betrayal by Wes Streeting\".",
      "The Department of Health said local health leaders would be given the money to decide how best to spend it.",
      "The Royal College of Midwives described the funding decision as taking \"a wrecking ball\" to maternity safety.",
      "'Short-sighted'",
      "The review into maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust, published in 2022, found that at least 201 babies and nine mothers could have survived with better care.",
      "Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by \u00a395m a year.",
      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",
      "But analysis of NHS funding for this year, carried out by the Health Service Journal, showed that just \u00a32m of the \u00a395m was to be ringfenced for 2025/26.",
      "The rest of the money will be given to the 42 Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) that decide how the health service funding is allocated locally across England.",
      "Responding to the change, Ms Ockenden posted on social media: \"How has this happened? So disappointed. Talking to colleagues across perinatal services, the sense of disappointment is profound.\"",
      "If the ICBs decide to spend the money they've been allocated on maternity care, there won't be a funding cut.",
      "But some maternity staff have labelled the change as disastrous, fearing that taking away the funding protection will mean maternity budgets will be cut.",
      "\"Removing the ringfencing will take us back years,\" said a senior midwife.",
      "The Royal College of Midwives said it was \"utterly shocked\" by Streeting's decision, adding it was \"short-sighted\" and \"utterly unacceptable\".",
      "\"These budget cuts\u2026 will rip the heart out of any moves to improve maternity safety,\" said chief executive Gill Walton.",
      "\"The government has taken a wrecking ball to the work that's being done up and down the country to improve maternity safety, something which is desperately needed.\"",
      "'More flexibility'",
      "Rhiannon Davies, who alongside Kayleigh Griffiths was instrumental in getting the Shrewsbury inquiry commissioned, was also strongly critical of the health secretary.",
      "The money, she wrote, \"was to ensure others avoided the lifelong pain we have to endure without our children\".",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said maternity care remained a top priority for the health service.",
      "In a statement, it said: \"The same level of funding is still being delivered as part of wider ICB allocations, giving local healthcare leaders - who are best placed to decide how to serve their local community - more flexibility.",
      "\"We are clear that too many women are not receiving the safe, personalised and compassionate maternity care they deserve, but through our Plan for Change, this government is determined to change that.\"",

    "story": [
      "The government has defended its net-zero policies after Sir Tony Blair said limiting fossil fuels was \"doomed to fail\" and a new approach was needed.",
      "The ex-Labour prime minister argued the climate change debate had become \"irrational\" and people in rich countries no longer wanted to make financial sacrifices \"when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal\".",
      "His comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.",
      "Asked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here.\"",
      "Labour ministers have insisted the drive to net zero will not involve any financial sacrifices and have minimal impact on people's lives.",
      "Minutes before PMQs, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement saying they \"support the government's 2050 net zero targets\" and that the UK government's approach is \"the right one\".",
      "Questioned whether the institute had been asked by the government to issue a clarification to help defuse a growing political row, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I won't get into private conversations.\"",
      "Sir Keir's spokesman also stressed that the PM had confidence in Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, adding that he was \"doing a great job\".",
      "But he said the PM did not agree with Sir Tony that there was too much \"hysteria\" in the climate change debate.",
      "He told reporters: \"I don't think so, I mean I think we're taking a very practical and pragmatic approach to this here in the UK.\"",
      "He added: \"Our approach to net zero is clear. It is families up and down this country that will pay the price for the UK's dependence on fossil fuel markets.\"",
      "Nicholas Stern - who wrote an influential report on the economics of climate change for Tony Blair when he was in government in 2006 - described the report from the Tony Blair Institute as \"muddled and misleading\".",

      "\"If the UK wobbles on its route to net zero, other countries may become less committed. The UK matters,\" said Prof Stern, who chairs the Grantham Research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics.",
      "The TBI report argues that the expected global rise in fossil fuel use and the doubling of airline travel over the next 20 years undermines current climate policies.",
      "\"These are the inconvenient facts, which mean that any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail,\" Sir Tony wrote in the foreward to the report.",
      "The report says existing carbon targets should be kept in place to give certainty to business but a rethink of how they are achieved was urgently needed.",
      "It says the focus should instead be on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear fusion - and new international efforts to persuade the world's biggest economies, such as China and India, to cut their emissions.",
      "To help achieve the 2050 target, Labour and the previous Conservative government made a series of pledges including \"clean\" electricity, ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and installing 600,000 electric heat pumps a year by 2028.",

      "And she said Sir Tony had sent a \"clear message\" to the government that it needs to \"rethink\" its approach to net zero.",

      "The TBI says it is \"editorially independent\".",
      "The Labour Party has had a complicated relationship with Sir Tony and his legacy since he left Downing Street in 2007.",
      "Ed Miliband's election as leader in 2010 over his brother, David, was seen in part as a repudiation of Blairism, as was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to a much greater extent.",
      "But since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in 2020 he has often embraced the most electorally-successful leader in Labour's history. He has also hired some of the leading figures from Sir Tony's Downing Street.",

    "summary": "Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court had provided \"legal clarity\".",
    "story": [
      "The justice secretary has said it is \"absolutely unacceptable\" to question the validity of the Supreme Court after it ruled that the term \"woman\" is defined by biological sex.",
      "Speaking to Parliament's Human Rights Joint Committee,  Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court \"provided the legal clarity in their legal decision which is exactly their job\".",
      "The decision was seen as a victory by women's rights groups but some trans campaigners have argued it did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology and a transgender former judge says she plans to bring an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .",
      "Mahmood said: \"It's disappointing... that some individuals have sought to question the validity of the Supreme Court or cast aspersions...\"",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court",
      "Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces",
      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "The judges said trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the \"potentially vulnerable group\".",
      "The Equalities and Human Rights Commission also published interim guidance after the ruling which said trans women \"should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\" in workplaces or public-facing services.  The same applies to trans men, who are biologically female.",
      "But it said that trans people \"should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use\".",
      "Mahmood was speaking to MPs and peers a day after Dr Victoria McCloud, the only UK judge to publicly say she is transgender, said she is planning to bring an appeal case before the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Dr McCloud, who stepped down from a High Court role last year, said the Supreme Court judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\".",
      "She said the ruling had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\".",
      "Some trans campaigners have expressed disappointment at the ruling. They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",
      "Mahmood told the committee the Supreme Court had \"handled things very sensitively\".",
      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",
      "In her evidence, to the Human Rights Joint Committee, the justice secretary also addressed the government's policy on transgender prisoners.",
      "Mahmood said it \"strikes the right balance\" but \"we will obviously now go back and with the clarity from the Supreme Court just make sure that that policy still stands to scrutiny or whether we need to make any changes\".",
      "The justice secretary said the vast majority of trans women inmates are within the male estate, and she had not moved any trans prisoners into women's jails since taking office last July.",
      "Prison service data for 2023-24 shows there were 295 transgender prisoners in England and Wales, with 51 in female prisons and 244 in male prisons.",
      "But she said: \"No trans women convicted of a rape or serious violence offence who retains birth genitalia would ever be considered for being placed in the women's estate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs despite pledging to do so.",
      "The Conservative leader said Sir Keir Starmer had promised \u00a35m to fund five locally-led investigations into grooming gangs but delivered just one, in Oldham.",
      "During Prime Ministers Questions, Badenoch suggested Sir Keir was \"dragging his heels\" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal.",
      "Sir Keir said Labour were \"investing more in delivering truth and justice\" for victims of grooming gangs than the Conservatives had during \"14 long years\" in power.",
      "Ministers have been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires alongside the review in Oldham, and a three-month audit of national evidence being led by government troubleshooter Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "Earlier this month Tom Crowther, the barrister helping to develop the schemes, suggested local inquiries into grooming gangs had stalled since they were announced in January.",
      "Crowther, who chaired the inquiry into child sex abuse in Telford, Shropshire, gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee at the start of April and told MPs he had asked a government official \"do you still want me?\"",
      "The issue was again raised in the Commons on Monday, when Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips told MPs she expected there to be more than five local inquires.",

      "More local grooming inquiries expected - minister",

      "The Tory leader said voters faced a choice of \"chaos and cover-ups under Labour councils or better services under the Conservatives\".",
      "Badenoch repeatedly asked Sir Keir for an update on the local inquires. When he did not respond, she said he \"cannot name a single place because nothing is happening\".",
      "She questioned whether the prime minister was \"dragging his heels\" on local inquiries into grooming gangs because he \"doesn't want Labour cover-ups exposed\", adding that the inquiries hadn't started because \"local authorities don't want to investigate themselves\".",
      "A national inquiry was needed as local probes \"cannot force witnesses to appear\" and \"cannot force people to give evidence under oath\", Badenoch said.",
      "Sir Keir accused Badenoch of \"staying silent\" on the issue in government while he \"oversaw the first grooming gang prosecution\" as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "He told the Commons: \"I was the prosecutor who brought the first case.",
      "\"On the back of that I then changed the entire approach to prosecutions, which was then lauded by the government that we were doing the right thing, and brought those prosecutions.\"",
      "In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour were \"implementing existing recommendations\" of the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse and \"providing for local inquiries\", he said.",
      "For more than a decade there has been a series of high-profile cases where groups of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, were convicted of sexually abusing and raping mainly white girls in the UK.",
      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "The Conservative have been calling for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs since the issue was thrust back into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the start of the year.",
      "The proposal was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour figures including Rotherham MP Sarah Champion alongside Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords, Labour's Baroness Hazarika offered an apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the \"sickening, despicable, wicked acts\" of child grooming gangs.",
      "She said that many people in Muslim community were as appalled as anyone else, telling peers: \"This is not who we are\", and added that many of the men were abusing Muslim women as well as white women.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for the the government to focus on implementing all 20 of the recommendations made by the Jay inquiry.",
      "On Monday, party spokesperson Lisa Smart said MPs \"owe it to\" victims to not just \"offer words of support, but to deliver justice and bring offenders to account\".",
      "Reform UK have backed calls for a national inquiry and have previously offered to fund their own.",
      "Party leader Nigel Farage has previously accused both Labour and Tories of \"failing to bring justice to the thousands of victims across multiple decades of these horrific crimes\".",

    "summary": "Sir Mark Rowley warns that without more funding, the Met will struggle to meet key crime targets.",
    "story": [
      "Rates of knife crime, violence against women, and theft could rise in London without more government funding, the Metropolitan Police commissioner has warned.",
      "In a report, due to be presented by Sir Mark Rowley to the London Policing Board this week, he says the force \"must be honest to Londoners that in light of the budget, we are shrinking as an organisation\".",
      "The commissioner acknowledges that extra funding from the Home Office and City Hall means the Met's final settlement is \"nearly \u00a3100m better\" than it feared in November 2024, when he warned of a \u00a3450m funding gap and \"eye-watering cuts\" to services.",
      "The Home Office has been asked to comment.",
      "Sir Mark says unless the Met receives more money in June's spending review, the government risks being unable to meet its own national promises to halve knife crime, and violence against women and girls, over the next decade.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC London last week that a review of the Met's finances is currently under way, alongside the mayor and Scotland Yard.",
      "The commissioner's report states the force wants to grow in size to 38,000 officers and 19,000 staff, but is forecast to have just 31,248 officers and 10,972 staff by the end of the year.",
      "He predicts the Met will lose about 1,700 officers, PCSOs and staff, but that additional funding may allow the force to reduce the losses by speeding up recruitment.",
      "'Less capacity, increasing demand'",
      "The report warns that with no additional investment, London may experience \"sustained increases\" in knife crime, violence against women and girls (VAWG), and theft.",
      "\"We will have less policing capacity and capability at a time when demand has been steadily increasing,\" the commissioner writes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly this will impact our ability to respond to victims of crime and Londoners and have consequences for our own officers and staff and our reform plans.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Met detailed a list of savings it would need to make in order to protect frontline services such as neighbourhood policing and public protection teams, which tackle sex offences and domestic abuse.",
      "Those plans include scrapping the Royal Parks police and Safer Schools officers, along with cuts to forensics and mounted police, and potentially taking firearms off the Flying Squad.",
      "Sir Mark's report warns the financial challenges are likely to have a \"negative impact on the speed and scale\" of reforms, which the force is under pressure to make following a series of scandals and a highly critical review two years ago by Baroness Casey.",
      "Met to cut 1,700 staff to plug \u00a3260m 'black hole'",
      "Royal Parks police could be cut to plug Met budget",
      "Met given more money for capital city policing",
      "Referring to key promises in the government's manifesto, the report says \"halving knife crime and VAWG will be impossible without significant reductions in London\".",
      "He argues that tackling crime will boost economic growth, stating that London loses at least \u00a336.5bn each year and that \"for every \u00a31 spent on policing, at least \u00a34 is added to the country's GDP\".",
      "Sir Mark also describes how the Met expects, without further funding, that it will have to close \"up to half our current buildings due to them being no longer habitable or legally compliant\".",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Quangos are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government and include watchdogs.",
    "story": [
      "Over 300 quango bosses received a higher salary than the prime minister last year, according to the TaxPayers' Alliance (TPA).",
      "Quango stands for quasi autonomous non-governmental organisations, which means they are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government, and include watchdogs as well as the prison service.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer axed the biggest quango, NHS England, last month and the government is currently reviewing hundreds of quangos in a bid to reduce bureaucratic waste and inefficiency.",
      "John O'Connell, chief executive of the TPA, said there should be more scrutiny of the hundreds of \"quangocrats\" taking home \"massive pay packets\" with minimal democratic oversight.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "Ministers to review hundreds of public bodies",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "As prime minister, Sir Keir is entitled to a salary of \u00a3172,153, which is five times higher than the median UK annual salary of \u00a337,430 in April 2024, as measured by the Office for National Statistics.",
      "In all, 315 quango chief executives received a higher salary, according to the TPA, with the top three being Channel 4's on \u00a3619,000, the chief executive of HS2 on \u00a3618,195, and head of Network Rail on \u00a3588,000.",
      "The research also found that at least 1,472 quango staff received more than \u00a3100,000 in total remuneration, which included salary, expenses and pension benefits.",
      "The TPA definition of a quango is wider than others and includes any non-ministerial department, public corporation, agency or other public body included in the government's departments, agencies and public bodies list, including the Bank of England and the BBC.",
      "Mr O'Connell said the TPA backed the Labour government's review of quangos, and urged more focus on scrapping unnecessary functions and bringing delivery of significant services back under political control.",
      "He said: \"Taxpayers will be shocked to hear that there are hundreds of quangocrats heading up bodies they may never have heard taking home massive pay packets the average Brit can only dream of.",
      "\"But beyond the healthy remuneration, arguably the bigger problem is that in many areas of government policy these quango bosses reign supreme, with minimal ministerial or parliamentary oversight despite the often highly sensitive and significant nature of what their organisation is responsible for.",
      "\"The government may have signalled an intent to get a grip of the quango state, but as well as restoring political accountability there needs to be serious review of some of the functions they perform.\"",
      "However, Matthew Gill, the Institute for Government's programme director on public bodies, said focusing on the pay of quango bosses could be misleading.",
      "\"It is important that public bodies are democratically accountable, but ministers cannot micro-manage everything in the public sector,\" he said.",
      "\"They need good people running things \u2013 and pay that is too low to attract them is a false economy.",
      "\"It is very difficult to evaluate whether public sector leaders are paid appropriately without benchmarking their pay to the private sector.\"",
      "Under Sir Keir, the Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos, including Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals; and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with \u00a3353.3bn budgeted for them in 2022/23, according to the latest published figures.",
      "The last major shake-up was under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, when a \"bonfire of the quangos\" scrapped nearly a third of them, including the Audit Commission and the UK Film Council.",
      "Asked last month if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced it will merge the Valuation Office Agency, which values properties for council tax and business rates, into HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by April 2026.",
      "It is the latest quango to be scrapped in a move the Treasury said would increase efficiency and cut duplication.",

      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",
      "It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.",
      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",
      "We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.",
      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",
      "\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.",
      "\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"",

      "The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.",

      "University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible.",
      "Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people.",
      "Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project.",
      "After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home.",
      "While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year.",
      "The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",

      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",

      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",
      "Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.",
      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",
      "The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.",

      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",

      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",

      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",
      "The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year.",
      "In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total.",
      "A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km.",
      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",

      "The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) says a succession of milder winters and wetter springs are all contributing to change in the natural world.",
      "While a brief warm spell won't make much difference to the natural world overall, it could be a bonus for nature lovers.",
      "\"On the plus side, better weather is more inviting for us to get out and enjoy the spring. Dawn chorus is at its peak at the minute and calm, warm mornings are perfect for enjoying it,\" says Jon Carter of the BTO.",

      "\"Climate change is already having a big impact on our wildlife, but a temporary blip like this is an end of April dividend for wildlife,\" says the Met Office's Grahame Madge.",
      "Some wildlife accelerates its activity with warm spring weather, so people may see natural areas near them teaming with life this coming week.",
      "Butterflies and birds may be particularly prominent, Mr Madge adds.",
      "Some studies suggest warm weather means birds can breed earlier in the year and do not need to incubate their young for as long.",
      "Migratory birds - such as swallows and swifts - that return to the UK because there are more insects to feed on in warmer climes, may be coming back sooner. The Met Office says a swallow was reported in southern England before March this year.",
      "Warm weather can also see butterflies emerge. Hotter days earlier in the year can bring out red admirals, previously an exclusively migratory insect.",
      "The peacock and small tortoiseshell are among the first to spread their wings, with more butterflies emerging from April onwards.",
      "Dragonflies start to be seen around this time, too.",
      "There could also be some sightings of rare visitors such as the exotic European bee-eater, which have recently begun nesting in the UK.",

      "Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland, says climate change is driving more regular wildfires of greater intensity, and especially so in spring.",
      "\"It is not just vegetation that gets destroyed by wildfire,\" she says. \"This is a critical time of year for our native wildlife \u2013 with birds nesting and other animals such as amphibians and reptiles coming out of winter dormancy and starting to breed.\"",
      "On the coasts, conservation experts say there has been a crop of sightings of whales and dolphins close to British shores \u2013 and though it's difficult to pin down a reason, warming seas and climate change are likely to be a factor.",
      "\"Seeing whales and dolphins in the wild is always an awesome experience but seeing more of them, and more unusual species around UK coast may not be such a good thing,\" says Danny Groves from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.",
      "Heatwaves and increases in sea temperatures can cause some whales to roam far from their usual areas just to survive, he adds.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is \"doomed to fail\".",
      "In a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal\".",

      "The Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the \"mad dash\" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.",
      "In its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.",
      "At the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.",
      "Writing in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"",
      "He says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".",
      "He also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".",
      "The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.",
      "It also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".",
      "Lindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"",
      "Ms Fursman said the report was \"pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise\".",
      "Downing Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.",
      "\"We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.",
      "\"Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.\"",

      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to.",
      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",

      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "Israel says its fighter jets bombed an area next to the presidential palace in Syria's capital, Damascus, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to protect the Druze religious minority following days of deadly sectarian violence.",

      "The Syrian government has said it has deployed security forces to Druze areas to combat \"outlaw groups\" which it has accused of instigating the clashes.",

HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK.",

    "summary": "Foreign policy is rarely a big factor in Australia's poll - but the US president has changed that.",
    "story": [
      "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.",
      "People here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.",
      "In recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.",
      "\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''",
      "Other spectators are more nuanced.",
      "\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"",
      "Australia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.",
      "But Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world.",
      "Trump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.",
      "All of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?",
      "'Nowhere else to turn'",
      "In the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.",
      "\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"",
      "The US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.",
      "The rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.",
      "It's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.",
      "Back in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.",
      "\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"",
      "Australia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.",
      "A blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.",
      "\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"",
      "While only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.",
      "\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"",
      "And, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.",
      "\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"",
      "A poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.",
      "And a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.",
      "An election upended",
      "Big questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.",
      "Dutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.",
      "\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"",
      "Dutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"",
      "And he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.",
      "Albanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.",
      "That may turn out to be in his favour.",
      "Indeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.",
      "For Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.",
      "\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says.",
      "\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"",
      "But whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.",
      "\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"",
      "Back at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground.",
      "Flying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.",
      "Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 04:03:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The de minimis exemption was key to the huge growth of the Chinese online retailers.",
    "story": [
      "A duty-free loophole for low-value packages has been closed by President Donald Trump, pushing up prices for US customers of firms like Shein and Temu.",
      "The Chinese online retail giants relied on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.",
      "Supporters of the loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (\u00a3600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.",
      "But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.",
      "What was the de minimis exemption?",
      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",
      "In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.",
      "In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.",
      "Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).",
      "Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu benefited greatly from the loophole.",
      "Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices",
      "And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.",
      "Shein and Temu did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.",
      "However last month, in almost identical statements, the rival companies said they have seen operating expenses rise \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\", adding they will make \"price adjustments\" from 25 April.",
      "Why has Trump closed the loophole?",
      "In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.",
      "The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.",
      "During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.",
      "It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages \"to exploit the de minimis exemption\".",
      "\"These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,\" it added.",
      "The truth behind your $12 dress: Inside the Chinese factories fuelling Shein's success",
      "How Temu is shaking up the world of online shopping",
      "The rise and rise of fashion giant Shein",
      "The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop \"abuse\" of the exemption.",
      "\"The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,\" it said.",
      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers saw prices rise.",
      "Shein and Temu put up prices for their US customers ahead of the 2 May deadline \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".",
      "The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in \"$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers\".",
      "Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.",
      "In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.",
      "In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\".",
      "The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3127.50; $169.35).",
      "Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.",
      "Will US border checks change?",
      "Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.",
      "Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.",
      "There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.",
      "According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would \"shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.\"",
      "\"CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,\" it added."

      "Deadly clashes between Islamist armed factions, security forces and fighters from the Druze religious minority near Damascus are another sign of the continuing fragility of the security situation in Syria after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.",
      "Outside players have once again been involved, with Israel saying it carried out air strikes to protect Druze civilians.",
      "It marks another fault-line in Syria, which has been left fractured and divided in the wake of 13 years of devastating civil war and decades of authoritarian rule by the Assad dynasty.",
      "The new Syrian authorities have said they are determined to bring unity and stability, but many inside and outside the country still point to their roots in jihadism and remain suspicious of their agenda.",
      "Israel says it struck gunmen attacking Druze in Syria after deadly clashes",
      "First Druze crossing in 50 years as Israel courts allies in Syria",
      "Syria's minorities seek security as country charts new future",
      "Before President Assad was toppled, his rule had been re-established in the main cities in Syria and along the highways between them - as well as the coastal heartland of the Alawite sect to which his family belongs.",
      "But there were other regions partially or almost completely out of his control.",
      "They included Idlib in the north, from where Syria's current leader Ahmed al-Sharaa led his Islamist rebel faction Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - a former al-Qaeda affiliate - to victory last December.",
      "In the north-east, Syrian Kurdish forces maintained semi-autonomy throughout the civil war and beyond.",
      "And south of Damascus, the Druze have also had some limited autonomy.",
      "Those divisions remain, although the Alawite areas are now the most serious flashpoints for Syria's new rulers.",
      "In March, days of fighting between security forces and fighters still loyal to Assad left hundreds of people dead, including civilians. Other armed factions loosely affiliated to the new authorities also became involved and carried out revenge killings against local Alawites.",
      "Such violence is the biggest fear both for those who support Sharaa and those who are against him.",
      "The latest clashes to the south of Damascus again involved fighters from several of the armed factions still active in Syria and the Druze. Their religion is an offshoot of Islam, with sizeable communities not only in Syria, but in Lebanon, Jordan and Israel too.",
      "It is the connection with Israel that prompted the country's air force to carry out several strikes during fighting in and around the town of Ashrafiyat Sahnaya on Wednesday.",
      "The Israeli government said the operation was a warning and demanded that the Syrian authorities prevent harm to the Druze.",
      "Syrian authorities said security forces were deployed to Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to restore security and stability, accusing what it called \"outlaw groups\" based there of instigating the clashes.",
      "But the spiritual leader of Syria's Druze community, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, condemned the violence as an \"unjustifiable genocidal campaign\" and said people had been defending their homes from attacks by extremists.",
      "According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 101 people have been killed this week in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, the mainly Druze suburb of Jaramana, and the southern province of Suweida, which has a Druze majority.",
      "The UK-based monitoring group said that included 71 members of the Druze community, including 10 civilians and 35 gunmen who were shot dead in an \"ambush\" while travelling from Suweida to Damascus on Wednesday, as well as 30 members of the security forces and allied armed groups.",
      "For now at least, the violence has abated, with the government said to have agreed ceasefires with local Druze leaders.",
      "But the suddenness and ferocity with which the clashes erupted - prompted it seems by an audio recording circulating on social media of a man insulting the Prophet Muhammad, falsely attributed to a Druze cleric - shows the potential for Syria to slide back into conflict.",
      "There is mutual suspicion between the new Islamist-led authorities and religious minorities like the Alawites and the Druze.",
      "It is a combustible mixture, which is only further inflamed by the role that outside countries like Israel and Turkey continue to play. Both have advanced their interests inside Syria since the fall of Assad.",
      "Israel has seized more land in the south of Syria beyond the area of the Golan Heights that it has long occupied.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for the full demilitarisation of Suweida and two other provinces south of Damascus. He says the new Syrian government is extremist and that the presence of its security forces anywhere near the border would represent a threat to Israel.",
      "Israel has played up its connection with the Druze community in the region, presenting itself as their defender, even if many Syrian Druze themselves do not see it that way.",
      "The new authorities in Damascus have rejected Israel's moves as an infringement of Syria's sovereignty, although they have been keen to make clear that they are not seeking conflict with Israel.",
      "Turkey was the key sponsor of the rebel forces that finally ousted Assad and it has established close ties with the country's new leadership. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced Israel's latest military intervention in Syria as a \"dangerous and unacceptable provocation\".",
      "Tension between Turkey and Israel over their differing aims in the new Syria add another complication to the host of problems facing Sharaa and his government.",
      "With so many forces both inside and outside Syria still dangerously at odds with one another, the goal of unifying and stabilising the country - despite some successes so far - remains hugely challenging.",
      "Syria will need plenty of breathing space as well as financial and political support from the international community to make real progress towards a better future for its citizens, impoverished and uprooted by years of bitter conflict."

      "It came as US President Donald Trump threatened action against those buying Iranian oil or petrochemicals on Thursday, after Washington introduced fresh sanctions this week on companies it said had links to Tehran.",
      "Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a \"better\" deal.",
      "He has previously warned of military action if these new talks, which began in April, do not succeed. Both sides described the first round of talks in Oman's capital Muscat as \"constructive\".",

      "The US State Department said in a statement: \"The Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict in the Middle East, advance its nuclear program, and support its terrorist partners and proxies.",
      "\"Today, the United States is taking action to stem the flow of revenue that the regime uses to fund these destabilizing activities.\"",

      "\"They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form.\"",

      "The US has launched several deadly strikes on Houthi targets in recent months in response to the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, which began in November 2023 in response to Israel's military campaign in Gaza.",
      "Trump has said that he is looking for a solution that would close Iran's pathways to build a nuclear bomb. But there are those in his administration who are pushing for the complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme.",
      "They are also pushing for Iran to stop support for its proxies in the region, including the Houthis.",

    "story": [
      "On Friday morning, a spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce announced that Beijing was assessing the possibility of tariff negotiations with the United States.",
      "It was news the rest of the world had been waiting to hear as astonishingly high  tariffs - up to 245% on some Chinese exports to the US - throttle trade between the world's two biggest economies, raising the spectre of a recession.",
      "\"US officials have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with China on tariffs,\" the spokesperson told reporters.",
      "\"China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open... If the US wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel unilateral tariffs.\"",
      "The statement comes a day after a Weibo account linked to Chinese state media said the US had been seeking to initiate discussions, and a week after Trump claimed discussions were already underway \u2013 a suggestion Beijing denied.",
      "\"China has no need to talk to the United States,\" Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television (CCTV), said in Thursday's post. \"From the perspective of negotiations, the United States must be the more anxious party at present.\"",
      "Such comments follow a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions.",
      "The question is not whether those discussions will take place, but rather when, under what circumstances and at whose behest.",
      "Playing chicken",
      "Experts characterise the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as both men attempt to save face while covertly pursuing a mutually beneficial outcome \u2013 namely, a de-escalation of the trade war.",
      "\"I expect some of this back-and-forth, because neither Washington nor Beijing wants to look like they are the side that's giving in,\" says Ja Ian Chong, assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\"[But] a de-escalation would be to the overall benefit of both sides, so there is some overarching incentive to do so.\"",
      "Wen-Ti Sung, an academic member of the Australian Centre on China in the World, puts it another way: \"It's like two race cars going at each other: whoever swerves first will be seen as the weaker of the two parties. And at this juncture, neither party wants to look soft.\"",
      "The leader who admits he was the first to initiate tariff talks would be seen as the one compromising his position in negotiations.",
      "\"Whoever seems desperate loses bargaining leverage,\" Mr Sung says. \"Both sides want to portray the other side as the more desperate one.\"",
      "This peculiar stalemate \u2013 where both parties seek the same outcome, but neither wants to be the first to suggest it \u2013 has resulted in a tactic of \"constructive ambiguity\": the deliberate use of language so vague that each party could arguably claim to be in the right.",
      "It is this tactic that Mr Sung points to as an explanation for Yuyuantantian's Weibo post.",
      "\"This is Beijing trying to explore the possibility of using word games to create an off-ramp for both sides, so that they can gradually climb their way down from this escalation spiral,\" he says.",
      "One way to escape this game of chicken is when a third party mediates, offering both sides an off-ramp. The other option, Mr Sung explains, is a \"much looser understanding of what 'the other side has reached out' means\".",
      "That way, the side that does indeed come to the table first is still able to characterise it as a response rather than the first move.",
      "In Trump and Xi's case, it would also mean that tariff negotiations could begin with both leaders claiming to have achieved some kind of victory in the trade war.",
      "A win at home",
      "The optics here are important. As Mr Chong points out, de-escalation is one thing \u2013 but another top priority for Trump and Xi is to \"deliver a win for their domestic audiences\".",
      "\"Trump obviously wants to show that he has made Beijing capitulate. And on the People's Republic of China side, Xi probably wants to show his own people and the world that he's been able to make Trump become more reasonable and moderate and accommodating,\" Mr Chong says.",
      "On the domestic front, both leaders are facing tariff-induced headwinds. Trump this week struggled to quell fears of a recession as fresh data indicated the US economy contracted in its first quarter for the first time since 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, Xi - who before the tariffs was already battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment - must reassure China's population that he can weather the trade war and protect an economy which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic.",
      "\"Both [Trump and Xi] recognise that at this point of the trade war, it's not going to be a winner-takes-all outcome for either side anymore,\" Mr Sung says.",
      "\"Trump recognises he's not going to get anywhere near 100% of what he wants, so he's trying to find a concession point where China can let him have just enough winning, especially for domestic purposes.\"",
      "While China is not unwilling, he adds, \"they are very much stuck on what's the right price point\".",
      "For Xi, Mr Sung described the situation as a \"two-level game\".",
      "\"The China side needs to manage US-China bilateral negotiations, while domestically Beijing needs to save enough face so that the Chinese leadership can hold on to this narrative of 'the East is rising and the West is declining',\" he says.",
      "\"A kowtowing of the East towards the West is not a rising East.\"",
      "At the time of writing, the US has not denied China's claims that it has been attempting to initiate talks. But the fact that both sides have now made that assertion indicates there is \"some sort of contact\", according to Mr Chong.",
      "\"The two sides are talking,\" he says. \"And that is a sign that there is some possibility that some accommodation could be reached.\"",
      "But the start of negotiations does not mean that the US-China relationship - which was rocky even before Trump kicked off a trade war - is close to being steadied.",
      "Mr Chong isn't holding his breath. For one, he believes the \"posturing\" suggests the two sides have not reached the point \"where they are both trying to seek a way out\".",
      "\"[Each party] may hope that there are concessions from the other side, so they're going to have this standoff until they see which side blinks first.\"",

      "\"Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,\" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.",
      "Despite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition.",
      "Chinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.",
      "Some analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.",
      "And now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians.",
      "In order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.",
      "A former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.",
      "He is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.",
      "Henry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more \"extensive targeting\" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.",
      "\"I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,\" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.",
      "Even non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.",
      "Liberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.",
      "But visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.",
      "The Chinese Australian electorate have become more \"politically mature\", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.",
      "\"Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,\" she says.",
      "Some are frustrated that the community is being \"seen merely for votes\".",
      "\"When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,\" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.",
      "She points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being \"Chinese spies\".",
      "\"This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,\" she says.",
      "These are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.",
      "In the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation.",
      "It is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.",
      "In 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.",

    "story": [
      "A hot meal is hard to come by in the Gaza Strip, but a lunch for needy families in the south is about to be delivered by donkey and cart.",
      "Today's dish is koshari - made with lentils, rice and a zesty tomato sauce - in a set of huge cooking pots in one of two community kitchens run by American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), a US-based humanitarian organisation.",
      "\"People rely on our meals; they have no source of income to buy what's left in the local markets and many foods are not available,\" says Sami Matar, who leads the Anera team.",
      "\"In the past we used to cook rice with meat - with protein. Now, because of the closure, there's no type of meat, no fresh vegetables.\"",
      "Two months ago, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza \u2013 preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and later resumed its military offensive, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said these steps were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages it still holds.",
      "Recently, the UN's World Food Programme and Unrwa, the agency for Palestinian refugees, said they had used up all their stocks of food aid.",
      "There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, with warnings that mass starvation could be imminent and that intentionally starving civilians is a war crime.",
      "\"Aid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip,\" the UN's humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, warned on Thursday.",
      "\"Blocking aid starves civilians. It leaves them without basic medical support. It strips them of dignity and hope. It inflicts a cruel collective punishment. Blocking aid kills.\"",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Gazans depend on a few dozen remaining kitchens for sustenance. The one run by Anera in Khan Younis feeds some 6,000 people a day.",
      "But if Israel does not lift its blockade, by far the longest it has ever imposed on Gaza, the kitchens - a last lifeline for so many - will soon have nothing to distribute. Food stockpiled during the ceasefire at the start of this year, has all but run out.",
      "\"The coming days will be critical. We expect we have two weeks' supply, maybe less,\" Mr Matar says as he shows a local BBC journalist around the vast, empty Anera warehouse.",
      "\"We used to receive more than 100 trucks every week - trucks of food parcels and hygiene kits. Now we don't have anything.",
      "\"We struggle to provide food such as rice, lentils, pasta, cooking oil and salt, for our community kitchens. It's very expensive to buy 1kg of wood and we need over 700kg a day for cooking.\"",
      "Israel has accused Hamas of stealing and storing humanitarian aid to give to its fighters or sell to raise money. The UN and other agencies deny aid has been diverted and say that they have strict monitoring mechanisms.",
      "\"We work hard to avoid any interference from any parties. We have an accurate and strong distribution process,\" says Mr Matar, inspecting lists of aid recipients on his computer.",
      "\"We have a database of hundreds of thousands of people, including their names, ID numbers and addresses - the co-ordinates of the camps. This avoids duplication with the work of other non-governmental organisations and ensures transparency.\"",
      "UN's top court begins hearings on Israel's legal duties towards Palestinians",
      "UN agency runs out of food aid in Gaza after Israeli blockade",
      "'It's really hard to have any hope': Gaza doctor describes daily struggle",
      "Back in the outdoor kitchen, Mr Matar tests the food from the steaming pots to check its quality. Parcels are wrapped up for distribution; each can serve up to four people.",
      "All the workers receive food for their own hungry families.",
      "The rest is soon transferred on the donkey cart through the bustling streets to al-Mawasi, a crowded tent camp for displaced people on the coast, where dozens of field monitors supervise the hand-out.",
      "An elderly man walking with crutches looks relieved as he clutches two parcels of koshari to feed his family of seven. \"Thank God, this will be enough,\" he says.",
      "\"Don't even ask me about the situation,\" he goes on. \"We're only alive because death hasn't taken us yet. I swear I was searching for a loaf of bread since the morning, and I found none.\"",
      "\"The situation is tragic, and it keeps worsening,\" comments a weary looking mother. \"Life is humiliating here. We have men who are unable to work. There is no income, and all the products are so expensive. We're unable to buy anything.\"",
      "\"At this time, this is excellent,\" she says of the warm meal she has just been given. \"Because there is no cooking gas, no food. When we want to have a cup of tea, I collect leaves to start a fire.\"",
      "It has now been more than a year and a half since the war in Gaza began, triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel. That assault killed around 1,200 people and more than 250 people were taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, with up to 24 of those believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,400 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More than 90% of the 2.1 million population has been displaced - with many forced to flee multiple times.",
      "The UN has warned that the current situation \"is likely the worst it has been\" due to the blockade, the renewed offensive and evacuation orders that have displaced some 500,000 people since 18 March.",
      "There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, with warnings that intentionally starving civilians is a potential war crime. The UN says that Israel has a clear obligation under international law as an occupying power to allow and facilitate aid for Gazans.",
      "Last Friday, US President Donald Trump said he had told Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu that \"we've got to be good to Gaza\" and pushed him to allow more food and medicine into the strip.",
      "There was no official response to that, but earlier in the week, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected criticism from the UK, France and Germany, which described the blockade as \"intolerable\" in a joint statement and insisting \"this must end.\"",
      "The ministry said more than 25,000 lorries carrying almost 450,000 tonnes of goods had entered Gaza during the ceasefire. It added: \"Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid.\"",
      "Israeli officials have indicated they plan to overhaul the aid distribution system.",

      "Many are painfully thin, with new warnings of acute malnutrition in Gaza - especially among the young.",
      "\"I don't know what will happen if our supplies end,\" says Mr Matar, weighed down by the responsibility of his work.",
      "\"The feeling of having to stop this vital help to people would be so stressful and depressing to me and my staff.\"",
      "\"We have an urgent appeal,\" he continues. \"Look at us, see our desperation, understand that time is running out. Please we just need to open the crossings again.\""

      "In the depths of winter and under the cover of darkness, convoys of small fishing boats left the safety of Scotland's most northerly islands to deliver valuable cargo and special agents to coves and fishing ports 200 miles away along the coast of Norway.",
      "On the perilous return journeys, refugees fleeing the occupation were hidden in the hold of the fishing boats, as they sought sanctuary in the British Isles.",
      "To commemorate the 80th Anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, six of the historic ships that formed part of the Shetland Bus convoys will set sail again from Bergen in Norway to replicate the journey back to Shetland.",

      "Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany on 8 April 1940, a few months before the full occupation of France.",
      "The Norwegian government and its Royal Family, including King Haakon VII, were forced into exile in London and thousands of Norwegian people followed in fishing boats and other small vessels, crossing the North Sea to seek refuge in the UK.",
      "In July 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill set up a clandestine organisation called the Special Operations Executive (SOE) with the sole aim of carrying out espionage and sabotage missions across German-occupied Europe.",
      "The Shetland Bus convoys were part of the Norwegian branch of the SOE, supporting the resistance movement in Norway.",
      "Between 1940 and 1945, they made 200 North Sea crossings, transporting hundreds of resistance agents, tonnes of weapons and supplies, and rescuing more than 300 Norwegian refugees fleeing the occupation.",
      "The 200-mile crossings took place in winter to make the most of the hours of darkness and avoid being spotted by German patrols.",
      "But this meant that the sea was often treacherous.",
      "The crews and passengers on board had to endure not only heavy North Sea conditions, but also the constant risk of discovery by German aircraft or patrol boats.",
      "On 27 September 1941, the MK Arnefjord left the small island of Hernar, to the north-west of Bergen, carrying 20 refugees.",
      "Although the weather started off calm, they soon encountered a raging storm. Everyone onboard was seasick and some discussed turning back.",
      "Eventually the Arnefjord made it safely across and delivered crews and passengers to the island of Mousa in Shetland.",
      "But others were not so lucky. Of the six boats that crossed the North Sea with the Arnefjord that weekend, only four made it.",
      "In total, 10 fishing boats were lost during the Shetland Bus convoys and 44 men lost their lives.",

      "The Ukrainians have now published the deal and there have been public statements from both sides. Here are seven key takeaways.",
      "No Ukrainian payback to US",
      "Trump has previously demanded that Ukraine pay back the $350bn (\u00a3264bn) of aid that he claims has been provided by the US during the war - a condition that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected.",
      "But Washington appears to have made a concession. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the agreement did not dictate that his country pay back any supposed \"debt\".",
      "Follow reaction to deal as it happensWhat minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Follow reaction to deal as it happens",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Trump has styled the agreement as a win for his side as well, saying his country will get back \"much more in theory\" than the billions that were provided to Ukraine by his predecessor Joe Biden.",
      "Tougher tone from US towards Putin",
      "The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia than is usually the case from the Trump administration.",
      "The agreement refers to \"Russia's full-scale invasion\" and the US Treasury Department adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".",
      "This will hearten Kyiv, which has demanded more pressure be placed on Russia in talks between Moscow and Washington discussing a possible ceasefire.",
      "Oil and gas included alongside minerals",
      "Despite the fact that much of the talk around the deal relates to Ukraine's mineral wealth, the agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons.",
      "In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.",
      "The inclusion of oil and gas has been seen as a softening of the Ukrainian position, since they were not in earlier drafts of the deal.",
      "Senior administration officials told reporters they believe that \"more value\" can be derived from these resources if the fighting ends quickly.",
      "No hindrance to Kyiv's EU ambitions",
      "Ukraine has long aspired to join the European Union and accession talks formally began last June.",
      "There were some concerns in Kyiv that the resources deal could hinder Ukraine's ability to join the EU, if it gave preferential treatment to US investors, as Kyiv and Brussels already have a strategic partnership on raw materials.",
      "But the deal's text says that the US acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU and the need for this agreement not to conflict with that.",
      "It also says that if Ukraine needs to revisit the terms of the deal because of \"additional obligations\" as part of joining the EU, then the US agrees to negotiate in good faith.",
      "Additionally, Kyiv says the US will support additional transfers of investment and technology in Ukraine, including from the EU and elsewhere.",
      "A US military commitment back on table...",
      "The US has framed the deal as an essential one to sign if Ukraine is to continue to receive its military assistance.",
      "Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington DC to sign the deal - said it envisaged the US contributing new assistance in the future, such as air defence systems.",
      "How much has US given to Ukraine?",
      "How much has US given to Ukraine?",
      "This, too, would mark a change in strategy for Trump - who has sought to wind down military support for Ukraine since returning to the White House.",
      "One outstanding question is what the accord will ultimately mean for the state of the war. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.",
      "...but US can still walk away any time",
      "It appears there are no concrete security guarantees from the US, which is something Ukraine and Europe have long been pushing the White House to provide.",
      "Trump has long been reluctant to give the same military commitment that Biden had given.",
      "Instead, his interest in staying the course with US support for Ukraine is more implicit, due to the economic commitments set out in this deal.",
      "That means there would still be a fragility about the commitment of Ukraine's most important ally.",
      "Profits to be reinvested in Ukraine?",
      "One intriguing point highlighted by Ukraine's government is that for the first decade of the reconstruction investment fund, profits will be \"fully reinvested in Ukraine's economy\", either in new projects or reconstruction.",
      "This could be potentially significant if there is no financial benefit for the US for 10 years.",
      "However, this provision does not appear to be in the agreement signed in Washington, although it might later be part of an additional \"technical\" deal.  Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that \"these terms will be subject to further discussion\".",
      "After that initial 10-year period, Kyiv says profits may be distributed between the partners.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News late on Wednesday that the deal was a signal to the American people that \"we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those and be partners with the success of the Ukraine people\".",
      "Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the deal as \"repayment\" to the US for the  \"hundreds of billions of dollars that our taxpayers suspect subsidised the war\"."

      "Eighteen months ago, few Israelis doubted the war's logic: to defeat Hamas and return the hostages.",
      "For many, the January ceasefire and subsequent return of more than 30 hostages raised hopes that the war might soon end.",
      "But after Israel broke the ceasefire and returned to war in mid-March, those hopes were dashed.",
      "\"We came to the conclusion that Israel is going to a very bad place,\" Danny Yatom, a former head of the spy agency Mossad told me.",
      "\"We understand that what mainly bothers Netanyahu is his own interests. And in the list of priorities, his interests and the interests of having the government stable are the first ones, and not the hostages.\"",
      "Many of those signing recent letters are, like Yatom, long time critics of the prime minister. Some were involved in the anti-government protests that preceded the outbreak of war on 7 October 2023 following Hamas's attack on Israel.",
      "But Yatom says that's not why he decided to speak out.",
      "\"I signed my name and I am participating in the demonstrations not because of any political reason, but because of a national reason,\" he said.",
      "\"I am highly concerned that my country is going to lose its way.\"",
      "The first open letter to be published, in early April, was signed by 1,000 air force reservists and retirees.",
      "\"The continuation of the war does not contribute to any of its declared goals,\" they wrote, \"and will lead to the death of the hostages\".",
      "The signatories urged Israelis to follow their lead before time ran out on the estimated 24 hostages still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "\"Every day that passes is further risking their lives. Every moment of hesitation is a crying shame.\"",

      "The government's determination to keep fighting Hamas, while hostages risk death in the tunnels of Gaza, Yoav said, was misplaced.",
      "\"We are very strong and we can beat Hamas, but it's not about beating Hamas,\" he said. \"It's about losing our country.\"",
      "During his time in Gaza, Yoav told me, he tried to be \"the best moral soldier that a man can be\".",
      "But the longer the war goes on, critics say, the harder it is for Israel to claim, as government officials often do, that its military is the most moral army in the world.",

      "Following expressions of outrage from the organisers, the police quickly backed down.",
      "Meanwhile, the prime minister continues to speak of his determination to defeat Hamas.",
      "Military pressure, Netanyahu continues to insist, is the only way to bring the hostages home."

    "summary": "The People's Action Party has upped its social media game this election to attract young voters - will it succeed?",
    "story": [
      "The TikTok video begins with Singapore's health minister Ong Ye Kung smiling at the camera while sitting on a park bench.",
      "\"So no-one told you life was gonna be this way,\" the instantly recognisable theme song to the sitcom Friends plays, as he's suddenly joined by the other four members of his team running in the upcoming general election.",
      "Cut to a snappy montage of them fist-bumping each other and mingling with residents at community events, as the song's chorus delivers their political message: \"I'll be there for you\".",
      "It's one of the many social media videos posted by Singapore's long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP) as the country gears up for the general election on Saturday.",
      "One of the longest-serving political parties in the world, the PAP has governed Singapore since 1959 and is widely associated with stability.",
      "But even as it continues to win elections with comfortable majorities, the PAP has also faced declining popularity over the last two decades.",
      "In recent years the party has embarked on a mission to revamp its straitlaced, no-nonsense image, particularly to attract younger voters who have typically been more sympathetic to the opposition.",
      "This campaign season, PAP ministers better known for stilted pre-written speeches have also been filming skits with social media influencers and sitting down for long conversations on podcasts. The party has even launched a special edition of the viral Labubu doll dressed in their white uniform.",
      "Leading the PAP in his first election since he took office as prime minister, Lawrence Wong boasts a significant online portfolio.",
      "On his social media accounts he has been showing off his guitar skills and discussing the national budget at a cat cafe. His recent visit to Vietnam was recapped on TikTok over a techno rave soundtrack.",
      "Other ministers in his cabinet have also ramped up their efforts: in an online video series with a local actor, culture minister Edwin Tong played barista and served  coffees; meanwhile health minister Ong spent a day as an trainee at a local radio station.",
      "Numerous Singaporean influencers have put out content featuring PAP faces, in what appears to be a concerted party effort to connect with a younger audience. Last June, local influencers and celebrities attended a PAP event that publicised their alignment with the party.",
      "Valerie Tan Su Min, a content creator who makes satirical videos about politics but does not work with political parties, told the BBC that efforts such as collaborations with influencers could seal the deal for some young voters.",
      "\"If they had not done their own research or realised the gravity of their vote, it's very possible that they might see one or two videos and be like, 'OK that's who I vote for,'\" she said.",
      "There's little doubt that the PAP, which has long held an overwhelming parliamentary majority, will continue to govern after this election.",
      "It has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations that have personally seen the country flourish under PAP rule.",
      "But while elections have been free from fraud and irregularities, critics also say the party maintains an unfair advantage through gerrymandering and a tightly controlled media.",
      "Still, in the last three elections, the party has experienced two of its worst-ever showings at the polls - a little over 60% of the popular vote.",
      "With an ageing support base, the key to the PAP's future victories is young people.",
      "\"Candidates from different political parties have taken to social media like never before,\" says Carol Soon, associate professor in communications and new media at the National University of Singapore, adding that the medium is \"increasingly assuming a 'broadcasting' nature\".",
      "Opposition parties have also jumped on the bandwagon, taking part in TikTok video trends and launching online talkshows.",
      "Some have turned awkward moments of their campaigns into social media gold. One of the most popular memes this election, \"look left look right\", stems from a song by an opposition candidate lamenting his dismal job prospects. After it went viral, he released a follow-up song about the lack of affordable housing.",
      "Social media has always been particularly important to opposition parties in Singapore, where the PAP government exerts significant control over mainstream media. It's also a medium that has become especially popular after a quarantine election in 2020 limited in-person campaigning.",
      "But the opposition's efforts have been dwarfed by the PAP's, thanks to its deep pockets.",
      "\"Resources still matter when it comes to digital campaigning,\" says Netina Tan, associate professor of political science at McMaster University, who noted that the \"resource-rich\" PAP can afford to \"amp up their digital campaign...and put out fancy Insta videos\".",
      "Rae Fung, a 28-year-old speaking coach, said she was paying extra attention to local podcasts featuring politicians as guests.",
      "\"It's very hard to lie about your expertise on a podcast. Because it goes really deep and usually it's not too edited,\" she said. \"It helps me understand their thought process and who they are as a person.\"",
      "\"Most of the candidates I've seen, they're doing enough on social media to reach us,\"  she said. But \"how they show up and who they are as a person is a lot more important than their social media game.\"",
      "For young Singaporeans like Ms Fung, their votes will ultimately go to the party that makes the most convincing pitch to solve their problems.",
      "The rising cost of living in Singapore - which consistently ranks as one of the most expensive places in the world to live in - has been one of the biggest concerns for young people. Many still worry that owning a home will becoming increasingly unaffordable in the future.",
      "There has also been growing uncertainty about job prospects and the economy. Singapore's authorities and economists have warned of the fallout and a possible technical recession from the US-China trade war and US President Donald Trump's global tariffs.",
      "The PAP government has tried to address these worries. Besides providing subsidised housing for first-time buyers, it has increased the supply of public flats and issued subsidies and cash vouchers to help with childcare and daily expenses. Opposition parties argue they can do more.",
      "At a recent PAP election rally, one 37-year-old attendee who declined to be named said that while he was \"not very confident\" that the PAP would be able to lead the country out of the global economic uncertainty, his \"confidence level is even lower\" for the opposition.",
      "Meanwhile at an opposition rally, 28-year-old Ariel, who only gave her first name, told the BBC that many of her peers have not been able to get jobs after graduation. She did not think the government had addressed their worries.",
      "Voting in more of opposition candidates would be the way \"for Singaporeans to voice out our pain and concerns\", she insisted.",
      "In Singapore media campaigns may be important for drumming up political participation during elections, said Dr Soon, but social media engagement does not translate directly into support at the ballot box.",
      "\"At the end of the day,\" she said, it's about \"whom people think would deliver\" - be it providing more jobs, lowering costs of living, or being alternative voices in parliament."

    "summary": "One man's struggle to save Uganda's once-profitable trees that produce shea butter.",
    "story": [
      "A former biology teacher-turned-environmentalist is on a crusade in Uganda to save the once-flourishing trees from which shea butter is made - the cosmetic known as \"women's gold\".",
      "Mustafa Gerima wants local communities to stop chopping down the trees to make charcoal - which they say is more profitable than the oil, also used in cooking, that is extracted from its fruit.",
      "He gave up teaching to dedicate himself to the trees when he returned home six years ago and was shocked to find the Mount Kei Central Forest Reserve, once lush with wild shea trees, had been turned into a near-barren expanse dotted with stumps.",
      "Now nicknamed \"Bwana Shea\" or Mr Shea, he walks from village to village in the north-west of the country rallying people to protect what he sees as a vanishing treasure.",
      "Local people, he said, had lost interest in the trees and began chopping them down as farmers were experiencing failed harvests.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, the shea nut tree had a pattern of its production. It flowered in December then by the time it reached April, it would be ready,\" Mr Gerima told the BBC.",
      "\"But now because of climate change there is this prolonged drought. Hence it affects the production of shea nuts.\"",
      "The growing popularity of charcoal from the shea nut tree has made the situation worse. It is said to burn for longer than other charcoal.",
      "\"Our community is affected by poverty. So they look at the tree as a cheap alternative source of income,\" Mr Gerima said.",
      "Uganda is losing an estimated 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of forest cover each year, and a significant portion of that includes shea nut trees, according to the country's environment ministry.",
      "Shea trees grow in the wild from West to East Africa - a vast strip known as the \"shea belt\". But the shea tree population has dramatically  plummeted in recent year, it says.",
      "This loss, combined with the poor harvests, has had a direct impact on people like Mariam Chandiru, a local shea butter producer for many years in the northern town of Koboko.",
      "\"We would get good money to take our children to school and take care of our families. But now my business is collapsing, it is a huge setback,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I used to sell up to five jerry cans of shea oil a week, right now I can only fill two jerry cans at most.\"",
      "It has traditionally been women who have gathered the nuts of the shea tree to produce Nilotica shea butter, prized globally for its cosmetic and culinary uses.",
      "Professor John Bosco Okullo, a leading agroforestry expert from Uganda's Makerere University who has been studying shea nut trees for more than two decades, also blames years of widespread insecurity for the problems.",
      "\"In the 1990s, communities used to own and protect the shea trees,\" the academic, who is part of a European Union project aiming to conserve and utilise the tree, told the BBC.",
      "This was before much of the north of the country was ravaged by a rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, whose fighters were notorious for abducting children - forcing the boys to become fighters and keeping the girls as sex slaves.",
      "The rebels have largely been wiped out, but nearly 20 years of conflict drove people to leave their villages and find safety in camps.",
      "Other communities were affected by dangerous cattle raids - also leading to the displacement of thousands of people in the early 2000s.",
      "\"After cattle raiding and civil unrest by the Lord's Resistance Army displaced people, the sense of ownership was lost,\" said Prof Okullo",
      "\"When people returned, they adapted to short-term gains like charcoal burning.\"",
      "Prof Okullo agrees with Mr Gerima that climate change has further exacerbated the situation.",
      "\"The productivity has gone down. The trees are not flowering and fruiting the way they used to. Rain fluctuation has disrupted the shea tree's natural cycles,\" he said.",
      "Rapid urban expansion is another threat.",
      "\"Most of these places which used to have shea trees now have new districts, new hospitals, schools,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"You find the shea trees are being cut for development. We need affirmative planting. Otherwise, if we are waiting for natural regeneration, it is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Despite what seems like a gloomy outlook, Prof Okullo takes heart from campaigners such as Mr Gerima.",
      "The former teacher's most widely known initiative involved a 19-day, 644km (400-mile) walk in 2020.",
      "He trekked from Uganda's capital, Kampala, to the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) headquarters in Nairobi, capital of neighbouring Kenya.",
      "\"Right now, there are a lot of NGOs mobilising communities,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"People are planting new trees and protecting those regenerating from stumps.",
      "\"Some are even using grafting techniques to shorten the juvenile phase - it used to take 15 to 20 years before fruiting, now some trees are fruiting much earlier.\"",
      "To meet rising demand and support sustainable supply chains, the professor and his colleagues are embracing technology.",
      "\"We are teaming up with our colleagues in computer science and physics to use Artificial Intelligence so that we can map the mature shea trees and try to project the yield,\" he said.",
      "The Ugandan government has also recognised the vulnerability of the shea nut tree. In 2023, it made the cutting down of trees for charcoal illegal.",
      "But enforcement has been patchy.",
      "\"There was a presidential order to stop cutting shea trees, but it's been difficult to implement,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"The demand for charcoal is highest in urban areas. Those who cut the trees aren't the ones using the charcoal. We need to provide alternative energy sources for cities to reduce the demand.\"",
      "For Mr Gerima, it remains a personal issue.",
      "\"Seeing people cut the tree has always caused me a lot of pain in my heart,\" he said.",
      "He continues his long walks to raise awareness, speaking to local councils, organising planting drives.",
      "\"This must not be one man's issue - it must bring in a concerted effort, a collective responsibility.\"",
      "His next steps include launching a grassroots tree-monitoring initiative and partnering with schools to integrate conservation into the local curriculum.",
      "He says his mission is not just to save a tree but to preserve a way of life.",
      "\"We need to think about our future generations. If they come and only find stumps, what will they think of us?\"",

      "Washington and Kyiv have signed a long-awaited deal involving Ukraine's natural resources, after months of contentious negotiations.",
      "Details are still emerging about the agreement, but both sides have confirmed that it sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split.",
      "In a statement, the US said the agreement \"signals to Russia\" that the Trump administration is \"committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous\" Ukraine.",
      "It comes just over two months after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Zelensky at the White House turned into a public shouting match sparking fear that the US might withdraw its support for Ukraine.",
      "Seven key takeaways from the US-Ukraine agreement",
      "Seven key takeaways from the US-Ukraine agreement",
      "What we know about the deal",
      "Ukraine's Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko flew to Washington on Wednesday after an apparent breakthrough in negotiations to sign the deal with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "After joining Bessent at a signing ceremony, Svyrydenko listed its provisions on social media.",
      "Posting on X, she said the deal establishes a reconstruction investment fund to help attract Western investment in Ukrainian projects in minerals, oil and gas.",
      "She says the resources will remain the property of Ukraine, and Kyiv will choose where to do the extracting.",
      "The partnership will be equal, on a 50/50 basis, she says, adding that the agreement includes no debt obligation to the US.",
      "The US will play a role in helping to attract investment and technology to the projects in Ukraine.",
      "As part of the deal, the US will contribute new assistance to Kyiv, which may include, for example, air defence systems.",
      "She says the fund's income and contributions will not be taxed by either country.",
      "Svyrydenko says the deal must still be ratified by Ukrainian lawmakers.",
      "The agreement recognises the contributions that Ukraine has made to global security, she writes, thanking everyone who worked on brokering it.",
      "It is unclear if the deal includes an explicit security guarantee from the US, something Zelensky has pushed hard for throughout negotiations.",
      "A US Treasury Department statement said: \"No state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.\"",
      "Trump, for his part, said the deal represents payback for the money the US has spent on the war so far.",
      "\"Biden handed them $350bn,\" Trump said in a phone call in to a town hall on the NewsNation network. He went on to add: \"We made a deal where we get much more in theory than the $350bn.\"",
      "BBC Verify: How much has the US given to Ukraine?",
      "BBC Verify: How much has the US given to Ukraine?",
      "Trump has made the claim that the US has spent around $350 billion (\u00a3263 billion) on Ukraine aid on numerous occasions. But a BBC Verify analysis found the actual amount is much lower.",
      "Asked if the US's presence in Ukraine might inhibit Russia's movement in the region, he said \"it could\".",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.",
      "This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.",
      "Also, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Svyrydenko, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "There are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines.",
      "A quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.",
      "Another issue is it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.",

      "Putin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster.

      "Published30 April 2025",
      "Published30 April 2025",
      "Romanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.",
      "Far-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.",
      "Georgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".",
      "The leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.",
      "He is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.",
      "At the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.",
      "Protesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections.",
      "What happened on TikTok?",
      "Pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.",
      "Georgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%.",
      "He declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning.",
      "Instead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.",
      "An independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".",
      "Authorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.",
      "The authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".",
      "Separately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.",
      "But authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians.",
      "The Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.",
      "Calin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election",
      "Influencer campaign",
      "Shortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\".",
      "They did not name a specific candidate.",
      "They had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it.",
      "FameUp declined to comment to the BBC.",
      "Cristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".",
      "Some influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.",
      "While the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"",
      "The comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".",
      "It is still not clear who created these bot accounts.",
      "Experts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".",
      "\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.",
      "The uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January.",
      "The Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections.",
      "In response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.",
      "Romeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents",
      "'TikTok King'",
      "Then, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.",
      "The prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts.",
      "His lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".",
      "We spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts.",
      "He says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.",
      "Elgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.",
      "Elgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"",
      "Much is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.",
      "It's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.",
      "\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"",

    "summary": "Turkey has been building military bases on Iraqi territory, the BBC finds, raising fears of an occupation.",
    "story": [
      "Nestled in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan sits the picturesque village of Sergele.",
      "For generations villagers have made a living growing pomegranates, almonds and peaches and foraging in the surrounding forests for wild fruits and spices.",
      "But Sergele, located 16km (10 miles) from the border with Turkey, has become increasingly surrounded by Turkish military bases, which are dotted across the slopes.",
      "One, perched halfway up the western ridge, looms over the village, while another in the east is under construction.",
      "At least seven have been built here over the past two years, including one by a small dam that regulates Sergele's water supply, rendering it off limits to villagers.",
      "\"This is 100% a form of occupation of Kurdish [Iraqi Kurdistan] lands,\" says farmer Sherwan Sherwan Sergeli, 50, who has lost access to some of his land.",
      "\"The Turks ruined it.\"",
      "Sergele is now in danger of being dragged into what's known locally as the \"Forbidden Zone\" - a large strip of land in northern Iraq affected by Turkey's war with the Kurdish militant group the PKK, which launched an insurgency in southern Turkey in 1984.",
      "The Forbidden Zone spans almost the entire length of the Iraqi border with Turkey and is up to 40km (25 miles) deep in places.",
      "Community Peacemaker Teams, a human rights group based in Iraqi Kurdistan, says that hundreds of civilians have been killed by drone and air strikes in and around the Forbidden Zone. According to a 2020 Kurdistan parliamentary report, thousands have been forced off their land and whole villages have been emptied out by the conflict.",
      "Sergele is now effectively on the front line of Turkey's war with the PKK.",
      "When the BBC World Service Eye Investigations team visited the area, Turkish aircraft pummelled the mountains surrounding the village to root out PKK militants, who have long operated from caves and tunnels in northern Iraq.",
      "Much of the land around Sergele had been burned by shelling.",
      "\"The more bases they put up, the worse it gets for us,\" says Sherwan.",
      "Turkey has been rapidly growing its military presence in the Forbidden Zone in recent years, but until now the scale of this expansion was not publicly known.",
      "Using satellite imagery assessed by experts and corroborated with on-the-ground reporting and open-source content, the BBC found that as of December 2024, the Turkish military had built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq.",
      "Through its vast network of military bases, Turkey now holds de-facto control of more than 2,000 sq km (772 square miles) of Iraqi land, the BBC's analysis found.",
      "Satellite images further reveal that the Turkish military has built at least 660km (410 miles) of roads connecting its facilities. These supply routes have resulted in deforestation and left a lasting imprint on the region's mountains.",
      "While a few of the bases date back to the 1990s, 89% have been constructed since 2018, after which Turkey began significantly expanding its military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "The Turkish government didn't respond to the BBC's requests for interviews, but has maintained that its military bases are necessary to push back the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara and a number of Western nations, including the UK.",
      "The sub-district capital of Kani Masi, which is only 4km (2.5 miles) from the Iraqi-Turkish border and parts of which are within the Forbidden Zone, may offer a glimpse into Sergele's future.",
      "Once famous for its apple production, few residents remain here now.",
      "Farmer Salam Saeed, whose land is in the shadow of a large Turkish base, hasn't been able to cultivate his vineyard for the past three years.",
      "\"The moment you get here, you will have a drone hover over you,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"They will shoot you if you stay.\"",
      "The Turkish military first set up here in the 1990s and has been consolidating its presence since.",
      "Its main military base, featuring concrete blast walls, watch and communication towers and space for armoured personnel carriers to move inside, is much more developed than the smaller outposts around Sergele.",
      "Salam, like some other locals, believes Turkey ultimately wants to claim the territory as its own.",
      "\"All they want is for us to leave these areas,\" he adds.",
      "Little leverage",
      "Near Kani Masi, the BBC saw first-hand how Turkish forces have effectively pushed back the Iraqi border guard, which is responsible for protecting Iraq's international boundaries.",
      "At several locations, the border guards were manning positions well inside Iraqi territory, directly opposite Turkish troops, unable to go right up to the border and potentially risk a clash.",
      "\"The posts that you see are Turkish posts,\" says General Farhad Mahmoud, pointing to a ridge just across a valley, about 10km (6 miles) inside Iraqi territory.",
      "But \"we cannot reach the border to know the number of posts\", he adds.",
      "Turkey's military expansion in Iraqi Kurdistan - fuelled by its rise as a drone power and growing defence budget - is seen as part of a broader foreign policy shift towards greater interventionism in the region.",
      "Similar to its operations in Iraq, Turkey has also sought to establish a buffer zone along its border with Syria to contain Syrian armed groups allied with the PKK.",
      "In public, Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence in the country. But behind closed doors it has accommodated some of Ankara's demands.",
      "In 2024, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly fight the PKK.",
      "But the document, obtained by the BBC, did not place any limitations on Turkish troops in Iraq.",
      "Iraq depends on Turkey for trade, investment and water security, while its fractured internal politics have further undermined the government's ability to take a strong stance.",
      "Iraq's national government did not respond to the BBC requests for comment.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",
      "Meanwhile, the rulers of the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan have a close relationship with Ankara based on mutual interests and have often downplayed the civilian harm due to Turkey's military action.",
      "The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), an arch enemy of the PKK, dominates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and has officially been in charge since 2005, when Iraq's constitution granted the region its semi-autonomous status.",
      "The KDP's close ties with Turkey have contributed to the region's economic success and have strengthened its position, both against its regional political rivals and with the Iraqi government in Baghdad, with which it tussles for greater autonomy.",
      "Hoshyar Zebari, a senior member of the KDP's politburo, sought to blame the PKK for Turkey's presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "\"They [the Turkish military] are not harming our people,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They are not detaining them. They are not interfering in them going about their business. Their focus, their sole goal is the PKK.\"",
      "The conflict shows no signs of ending, despite the PKK's long-jailed leader Abdulla Ocalan calling in February for his fighters to lay down arms and disband.",
      "Turkey has continued to shell targets across Iraqi Kurdistan, while the PKK claimed responsibility for downing a Turkish drone last month.",
      "And while violent incidents in Turkey have declined since 2016, according to a tally by the NGO Crisis Group, those in Iraq have spiked, with civilians living on the border region facing growing risk of death and displacement.",
      "One of those killed was 24-year-old Alan Ismail, a stage-four cancer patient hit by an air strike in August 2023 while on a trip to the mountains with his cousin, Hashem Shaker.",
      "The Turkish military has denied carrying out a strike that day, but a police report seen by the BBC attributes the incident to a Turkish drone.",
      "When Hashem filed a complaint in a local court about the attack he was detained by Kurdish security forces and held for eight months on suspicion of supporting the PKK - an accusation he and his family deny.",
      "\"It has destroyed us. It's like killing the whole family,\" says Ismail Chichu, Alan's father.",
      "\"They [the Turks] have no rights to kill people in their own country on their own land.\"",
      "Turkey's Defence Ministry did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment. It has previously told the media that the Turkish armed forces follow international law, and that in the planning and execution of their operations they only target terrorists, while taking care to prevent harm to civilians.",
      "The BBC has seen documents suggesting Kurdish authorities may have acted to help Turkey evade accountability for civilian casualties.",
      "Confidential papers seen by the BBC show a Kurdish court closed the investigation into Alan's killing, saying the perpetrator was unknown.",
      "And his death certificate - issued by Kurdish authorities and seen by the BBC - says he died because of \"explosive fragments\".",
      "Failing to mention when victims of air strikes have died as a result of violence, rather than an accident, makes it difficult for families to seek justice and compensation, to which they're entitled under both Iraqi and Kurdish law.",
      "\"In most of the death certificates, they only wrote 'infijar', which means explosion,\" says Kamaran Othman from Community Peacemaker Teams.",
      "\"It can be anything exploding.",
      "\"I think the Kurdish Regional Government doesn't want to make Turkey responsible for what they are doing here.\"",
      "The KRG said it acknowledged the \"tragic loss of civilians resulting from military confrontation between the PKK and Turkish army in the region\".",
      "It added that \"a number of casualties\" had been documented as \"civilian martyrs\", meaning they have been unjustly killed and entitling them to compensation.",
      "Almost two years after Alan was killed, his family is still waiting, if not for compensation, at least for acknowledgement from the KRG.",
      "\"They could at least send their condolences - we don't need their compensation,\" says Ismail.",
      "\"When something is gone, it's gone forever.\""

      "\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.",
      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",
      "Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.",
      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea.

      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",

      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",

    "story": [
      "On the journey into Yarrabah, there is nothing to suggest a national election is just days away.",
      "Posters for candidates, inescapable in other parts of Australia, are conspicuously absent as you drive past fields of sugar cane and down a gently winding coastal road.",
      "After entering this small Indigenous community near Cairns in far north Queensland, with fishing nets sitting on palm-lined shores, the only thing fighting for attention is a truck selling ice cream \u2013 urgently dinging a bell as it avoids the wild horses and dogs that wander the streets.",
      "\"It's weird,\" says Suzanne Andrews, chief executive of the town's Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. \"We don't see any placards. No-one's visiting us.\"",
      "Watching the leaders of Australia's two major parties debate each other on television, the Jaru Bunuba Bardi woman was dismayed that \"they didn't talk about any Aboriginal issues or concerns\".",
      "\"So,\" she asks \"what the hell's going on?\"",
      "Indigenous Australians, who represent about 3.8% of the nation's 26 million population, are by most socio-economic measures the most disadvantaged people in the country - something successive leaders have for years called a \"national shame\".",
      "Yet in this election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.",
      "One glaring exception occurred this week, when during the final leader's debate Dutton said Indigenous \"welcome to country\" ceremonies -  where a local Aboriginal person acknowledges and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands - were \"overdone\" and should not take place so frequently.",
      "The comments represent one of the only times on the campaign trail that Dutton has publicly addressed issues specifically relating to First Nations people \u2013 and not to discuss disadvantage, but within the context of a culture war.",
      "Part of the reason politicians try to steer clear of First Nations issues, according to experts and advocates, is that many believe they are too divisive and therefore electorally risky \u2013 especially after the failure of the Voice to Parliament referendum in 2023.",
      "That referendum, which was loudly supported by Albanese in the most polarising moment of his leadership, saw 60% of voters reject a proposal to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's constitution and give them greater political say through a Voice to Parliament.",
      "Those opposing it said the idea was divisive, would create special \"classes\" of citizens where some have more rights than others, and the new advisory body would slow government decision-making.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on both sides of the debate told the BBC they hoped the unprecedented level of interest in their lives would build momentum for more policies to improve them.",
      "Ms Andrews was one of them. But now she looks back at the result with sadness, believing it has now led political parties to \"play it safe\" and avoid \"the hot Aboriginal issues\".",
      "Others, including those who loudly opposed the Voice proposal, agree.",
      "On referendum night, prominent anti-Voice campaigner Warren Mundine told the BBC \"now the hard work starts\".",
      "Some 18 months on, he says the reality is that people on both sides of the political aisle promptly disengaged with Indigenous issues after the referendum.",
      "\"This is one of the sad things about this election campaign here: whether the Voice got up or didn't get up, we still had work to do,\" he said.",
      "\"What's happened now is that this is probably the first election that I've been in where there is no conversation about an Aboriginal policy. It's just gone silent.\"",
      "Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator in Victoria, told the BBC that \"Albanese particularly is too scared to mention us [Indigenous Australians] because of his failed referendum that we should never have had in the first place\".",
      "Thorpe spearheaded an Indigenous-run Blak Sovereign movement opposing the Voice, calling instead for priority to be given to a legally binding treaty between First Nations peoples and the Australian government.",
      "\"In previous elections, even though we may have been an afterthought and tacked on the end of the sentences, like we always are, at least we were mentioned. Now it's complete silence,\" she said.",
      "\"This election could have been a real opportunity for both leaders to unite the nation and tell some truth about the plight of our people. They need to tell the truth that these injustices continue, and they need to tell the truth that they are in a position to change that, to turn that around.\"",
      "Since 2008, the Australian government's Closing the Gap strategy has sought to reduce levels of Indigenous disadvantage through the annual tracking of 18 key measures in areas such as health and education.",
      "The latest review, however, found only four were on track to be met, while four were worsening \u2013 including the annual rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration, which was up 12% in a year.",
      "Despite these trends, Professor Rodney Smith of the University of Sydney says the defeat of the Voice - including in many Labor strongholds - makes it \"electorally foolish\" to talk too much about First Nations issues this election.",
      "He points to Coalition adverts that tie money \"wasted\" on the referendum \u2013 which is estimated to have cost more than $A400m \u2013 into the discussion about cost of living and a struggling economy.",
      "Prof Smith also argues, however, that the 2025 election is not unprecedented in its lack of focus on Indigenous affairs, but rather a return to the norm after several years of the issues receiving more attention than usual.",
      "\"I'm not saying people shouldn't care about this,\" he says. \"I'm just saying that generally speaking, the electorate doesn't particularly care about it.\"",
      "Recent data from Australian National University (ANU) seems to back that up. A long-term study of voter attitudes found that between January 2024 and January 2025 there was a sharp decline in the number of people believing it was the government's responsibility to reduce the gap in living standards between First Nations Australians and the rest of the population.",
      "\"This lack of policy focus (by Labor and the Coalition) reflects a low prioritisation amongst the Australian population\" ANU's Professor Nicholas Biddle said.",
      "Independent MP Bob Katter puts it more bluntly.",
      "A former minister of Aboriginal Affairs when a Queensland state MP in the 1980s, Mr Katter says he thinks about the struggles of many Indigenous Australians \"every night before I go to bed\".",
      "He told the BBC he believes in more self-governance and has campaigned to give greater access to farmable land and fishing rights.",
      "He also admits he doesn't talk about those issues on the campaign trail, though.",
      "\"As a politician that's got to win votes in the election, I wouldn't be game,\" he told the BBC.",
      "That's hard for many Indigenous people to swallow given the toll the referendum took - on those on both sides of the debate.",
      "A report published by Sydney's University of Technology last month found that the Voice referendum led to an increase in hostile levels of racism towards First Nations People, recording 453 \"validated\" incidents of racism roughly six months either side of the vote.",
      "About a fifth of all complaints contained mention of the failed referendum.",
      "\"While there was significant thought and debate given to the ideas of nation building and the righting of wrongs, the undercurrent of racism was ever present,\" said the report's guest author Professor Lindon Coombes in his introduction.",
      "\"This is its insidiousness.\"",
      "In Yarrabah, Ms Andrews becomes suddenly tearful, telling how her two daughters, studying at university in Brisbane, were intimidated and got \"so many racist remarks\" after the vote.",
      "\"To do this to young people, who have left community to better their life and to be something, is so wrong,\" she said.",
      "'My ancestors were invisible. I want to be visible'",
      "Hurt ripples in wake of Indigenous Voice vote",
      "It was not just increased racism that caused harm, but the tone and intensity of the debate leading up to the vote, many say.",
      "Mr Mundine says his participation in the toxic and polarised national discussion meant he felt alienated from many in his community.",
      "\"I got kicked off boards. I lost jobs\u2026 [I] was ostracised.\"",
      "\"Being the topic of every discussion for such a long period of time was overwhelming and extremely damaging to people's social and emotional well-being,\"  says Clinton Schultz, a Gamilaroi/Gomeroi man, psychologist and Director of First Nations Strategy at the Black Dog Institute.",
      "\"The aftermath of that has left a lot of people not willing to engage in in the debates moving forward.\"",
      "Millima May, a Kulumbirigin Danggalaba Tiwi woman from the Northern Territory, in 2023 told the BBC all First Nations people wanted was \"a seat at the table\" where decisions about their lives were made. But now there's been a \"tactical\" decision by some in the community to \"lie low\".",
      "\"I think a lot of Aboriginal people have really chosen to opt out of the political space and of so -called democracy in Australia,\" she says.",
      "\"If you could trust our political leaders and candidates to have nuanced and informed conversations, then you would be able to have debates and conversations in a respectful and safe way.",

      "This claim is false.",
      "The average national price for consumers of a dozen large Grade A eggs when Trump entered office in January was about $4.95 (\u00a33.70).",

      "Are border crossings the lowest on record?",

      "He said: \"For two months in a row, we have set all time records for the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded.\"",
      "This claim is backed up by the latest monthly figures on \"encounters\" of illegal migrants recorded by officials at the US-Mexico border.",
      "In March, there were 7,181 encounters of migrants there and in February there were 8,346.",
      "These are the the lowest numbers since these monthly records began in 2000.",
      "By comparison, there were about 140,000 encounters at this border in each of those months last year under President Biden.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:20:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The Spanish grid operator said the preliminary assessment suggests there was no cyber attack.",
    "story": [
      "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.",
      "But the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear.",
      "The grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"",
      "Information is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.",
      "Here is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.",
      "Follow live: Travel chaos continues",
      "Was the power cut caused by renewable energy?",
      "S\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".",
      "Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.",
      "One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.",
      "However, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.",
      "So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.",
      "The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.",
      "If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.",
      "\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.",
      "If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.",
      "But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.",
      "Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.",
      "\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.",
      "Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.",
      "\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.",
      "\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"",
      "Was it related to Spain's connection to France?",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.",
      "Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.",
      "Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.",
      "The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.",
      "Was it linked to a 'rare atmospheric event'?",
      "Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.",
      "The message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".",
      "\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\"",
      "However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

      "The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.",
      "This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.",
      "He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.",

      "No one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)",
      "Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.",
      "The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",
      "While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.",
      "A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.",
      "Although Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge.",
      "Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.",
      "Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.",
      "The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.",
      "Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test."

    "story": [
      "As life in Spain and Portugal stutters back to normal, the big questions are not just what went wrong but how to prevent such a full-scale power failure from happening again.",
      "It was not until 11:15 (09:15 GMT) on Tuesday, almost 23 hours after the system collapsed that Spain's electricity grid declared it was back to normal.",
      "The trains have started running again although some lines are suspended and most homes have got their power back.",
      "So how did it get back up and running and why did it take so long?",
      "For most of Monday, Spain was in chaos.",
      "The issue appears to relate to two separate connection problems in the south west within moments of each other and then a disconnection from the French network for almost an hour.",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez highlighted the sudden loss of 15 gigawatts of electricity at 12:33 on Monday, when about 60% of Spain's power generation suddenly vanished.",
      "Eduardo Prieto, the director of operations for the grid, Red El\u00e9ctrica, said the systems had been stable, until two \"disconnection\" incidents within seconds of each other in the south-west, where Spain has substantial solar generation.",
      "Only the Canary Islands, the Balearics and Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast were unaffected.",
      "An increasing number of public figures are blaming a saturation of solar power and an over-reliance on renewable energy.",
      "Minutes before the outage, Spain was running on 60.64% solar photovoltaic generation, with 12% wind and 11.6% nuclear.",
      "However diversified and advanced Spain's energy mix is, the national power collapse at 12:35 on Monday required an enormous effort to get Spain back up and running.",
      "The initial focus was to get the northern and southern power generating regions working again, which grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica said was key to \"gradually re-energising the transmission grid as the generating units are connected\".",
      "The risk lay in overloading the system by turning everything on at the same time and triggering another massive outage.",
      "So everything had to be carefully phased for what experts call a \"black start\" working out as a success.",
      "The initial focus was on hydro-electric plants, in particular pumped-storage plants  with reservoirs full at this time of year and able to produce electricity fast from a standing start.",
      "Combined-cycle gas plants also played a significant part in repowering the grid, but four nuclear power reactors at Almaraz, Asc\u00f3 and and Vandell\u00f3s were automatically shut down by the outage, and three others were already offline anyway.",
      "Spain's neighbours France and Morocco also came to its aid.",
      "Morocco said 900MW of power had been transferred through two high-voltage lines that cross the Strait of Gibraltrar from Fardioua to Tarifa in southern Spain.",
      "French operator RTE said it had been \"gradually transferring more electricity to the Spanish border\" via its power lines supplying Catalonia in north-east Spain and the Basque country in the north-west.",
      "RTE said the Iberian network had been disconnected from 12:38 to 13:30 on Monday, when the 400kV line to Catalonia was restored. Within minutes, France had supplied 700MW and RTE said it was later able to increase that by up to 2,000 MW.",
      "Power was then eventually restored to Spain's electricity substations in the north, south and west of the peninsula.",
      "By 19:20 on Monday, the grid operator said more than a fifth of demand had been restored by way of Spain's own electricity generation and from France.",
      "Electricity provider Endesa said it had restored almost 3.5 million customers by 19:15 and had prioritised hospitals and other strategic infrastructure.",
      "Just over an hour later the head of Red El\u00e9ctrica boss Eduardo Prieto said about 9,200 MW of demand - about 35.1% - had been restored.",
      "That figure rose steadily to 61.35% by midnight on Monday and more than 99% by 07:00 on Tuesday.",

      "The conservative head of the Madrid community, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, said the government's response had been slow and ineffective, while the leader of her People's Party Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o complained of a \"lamentable\" image of Spain being sent around the world.",
      "Despite all the problems, Spaniards were praised by the government for rising to the occasion and showing solidarity.",
      "Hospitals had back-up diesel-operated generators so they were able to keep critical care going.",
      "Spain's Guardia Civil police force said it had rescued 13,000 passengers trapped on trains.",
      "Residents in the southern town of Villanueva de C\u00f3rdoba came to the aid of passengers stranded on a Ouigo train.",
      "Local police in Barcelona returned to the old ways, regulating traffic in the Pla\u00e7a Espa\u00f1a because the lights were out.",
      "Passengers on the Barcelona metro had to walk to safety using the torches on their mobile phones when their trains became stuck in tunnels.",
      "A conference centre in Girona was converted into a 180-bed shelter for people stranded by rail disruptions.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Apr 2025 19:06:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Belichick's statement comes after segments of the interview posted to social media focused attention on the 73-year-old's relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
    "story": [
      "Former Patriots coach Bill Belichick says his recent\u00a0interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0created \"a false narrative\" about his relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
      "Belichick, 73, who is now head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sat down with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil ahead of the release of his new book, \"The Art of Winning,\" but many commenters online focused on the glimpses of his relationship with Hudson.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday, Belichick said, \"Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" the statement continued. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.\"",
      "A CBS News spokesperson\u00a0responded: \"When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview. There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.\"",
      "Belichick's statement comes after portions of the interview posted to social media\u00a0generated scrutiny\u00a0of his relationship.",
      "Out of the eight-minute segment that aired on \"Sunday Morning,\" Belichick and Dokoupil discussed Hudson, whom the football legend described in his upcoming book as his \"creative muse,\" for about one minute and 30 seconds.",
      "Dokoupil said in the recorded voiceover that Hudson was a \"constant presence\" during the interview. He asked Belichick, \"You have Jordon right over there. Everybody in the world seems to be following this relationship. They've got an opinion about your private life. It's got nothing to do with them, but they're invested in it. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "\"I've never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,\" Belichick replied. \"Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\"",
      "When Belichick was asked how the two of them met, Hudson spoke up: \"Not talking about this.\"",
      "In his statement Wednesday, Belichick defended Hudson.",
      "\"She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021,\" he said.",
      "\"The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career. Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "In a separate statement released Tuesday, Belichick's literary agent, InkWell Management, said the segments resulted in \"a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\"",
      "\"Bill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" InkWell Management said.",
      "Belichick's book\u00a0\"The Art of Winning\"\u00a0is scheduled for release May 6.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:07:09 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter - subject of the new Broadway musical \"Just in Time\" - was renowned for such pop hits as \"Splish Splash,\" \"Mack the Knife,\" and \"Dream Lover.\" But his life was unsettled when he learned, at age 32, the startling truth about the identity of his mother.",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Darin was a major pop star \u2026 a singer, dancer, musician, and an Oscar nominee. He was the entertainer who did it all, except Broadway. Until now!",
      "Tony Award-winner Jonathan Groff (\"Merrily We Roll Along\") plays the icon of the late 1950s and '60s in the musical \"Just in Time.\" \"He was at the height of his powers, when he was on the floor of a nightclub with the audience in the palm of his hand,\" said Groff.",
      "For Darin, a live audience was oxygen. So, too, for Groff: \"You can feel this vibration between performer and audience member. [It's], to me, the most essential thing to ignite in the telling of his story.\"",
      "It's taken seven years and a whole lot of sweat to bring the show to Broadway. The casting of Groff \u2013 beloved for his roles on stage, and as Kristoff in the \"Frozen\" movies \u2013 might not seem obvious. Groff grew up on a horse farm in Pennsylvania Mennonite country; Darin was a scrappy Italian kid from the Bronx.",
      "I asked Groff to whom he liked listening when he was growing up. \"I am in fourth or fifth grade, on the computer or Nintendo in the basement, blasting Ethel Merman, 'Annie Get Your Gun,'\" he laughed.",
      "\"So, this is the 1990s, probably? And you're playing something from the 1940s?\"",
      "\"Exactly!\"",
      "Likewise, Bobby Darin was an old soul, says his son, Dodd Darin. \"He admired, he loved, he respected the old timers. He loved that era of show business. That's what he related to.\"",
      "That may have had something to do with the woman who raised him: \"Polly, his mother, was an old vaudevillian,\" said Dodd. \"And she nurtured him and said, 'You can't play stickball in the street. And you can't roughhouse with kids' ('cause he was frail and sickly). 'But you can learn to sing. You can learn to dance. You can learn to play piano.' And it opened a whole world.\"",
      "\"Frail and sickly\" was no exaggeration. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Darin suffered several bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, permanently damaging his heart. When he was a boy, he overheard a family doctor say that he wouldn't live beyond his teenage years. \"Put yourself in that position,\" said Dodd. \"So, he was ambitious. He was driven. He was always on the go. He was trying to jam it all in, 'cause he knew he didn't have time.\"",
      "With no time to waste, he began writing songs, and at 22, Bobby Darin made waves with a recording of \"Splish Splash.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Splish Splash\" (1958):",
      "Not one to play it safe, for his second album, in 1959, Darin took a dark ballad from the German \"Threepenny Opera\" and made it swing. \"When my dad took 'Mack the Knife' before it was released and had Dick Clark listen to it, he said, 'Why are you doing this? This is gonna bomb!'\" Dodd said.",
      "It won the Grammy for record of the year, and became the biggest hit of Darin's career.",
      "The next year, he was on his way to Italy to make his motion picture debut opposite America's sweetheart, Sandra Dee. \"We hit it right off,\" Darin said. \"She hated me and I loved her, and that was it.\"",
      "The teen idol married the teen movie star in December of 1960, and welcomed their son, Dodd, a year later. Dodd would later write, \"My father made his destiny. Destiny made my mother.\"",
      "What did he mean by that? \"Well, my mom went through a lot,\" he said. \"Never really wanted fame. She really didn't crave it. It just sort of happened. Unlike my dad, who loved performing, loved show business.\"",
      "Dee was looking for a home life, said Dodd, but Bobby Darin wasn't ready to slow down. The marriage ended after six years. Darin never stopped playing the clubs.",
      "Sammy Davis Jr. once said that Bobby Darin was the one person he wouldn't want to have to follow. \"Absolutely true,\" said Dodd. \"My dad idolized Sammy.\"",
      "The feeling was mutual, as seen in a 1959 broadcast of \"This Is Your Life\":",
      "Also featured during the episode was Nina, the woman Darin thought was his sister. But almost a decade later he would learn a long-held family secret: Nina was in fact Bobby's mother, having given birth to him out of wedlock as a teenager. Which made Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, his grandmother. \"He was never the same,\" said Dodd. \"He said that his whole life was a lie; he was, like, a fraud. It's just devastating. There's no sugarcoating it.\"",
      "Looking at that tape today, says Dodd, it all seems obvious. \"That's a mother's love,\" he said. \"That's not a sister, okay? That's the adulation of, 'This is my son,' but you can't say it.\"",
      "Dodd, who was seven years old when his father found out, remembers a change in your father from that time: \"I'm not gonna say it's directly attributed to that incident; I'm sure that's part of it. But he got into the Bob Darin stage, you know? He took off his toupee. No more tuxedo. Started doing folk music, protest music, writing music, and dropped out of show business for a while.",
      "\"And that was some of the best times I had with him. He was a regular dude. We were up in Big Sur in a trailer, hanging out. And yeah, he let his hair down, if you will. It was good times.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Simple Song of Freedom\" (1970):",
      "In December of 1973, Bobby Darin's heart finally gave out. He was 37. Dodd had just turned 12. Now 63, Dodd Darin is grateful that, with the new Broadway show, a new generation can learn the story of his father.",
      "\"It's so beautiful that all these years later \u2013 he's been gone over 50 years \u2013 we're here talking about him. We're remembering him,\" said Dodd. \"He did something right.\"",

      "Diabetes deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate data for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",
      "Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately.",
      "\"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\" Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.",

      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve COVID-19 vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.",

      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also now weighing whether to significantly narrow its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",

      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",

      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",

      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",

      "\"The Chamber requests the administration take immediate action to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,\" she wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have\u00a0raised the chances\u00a0of a recession over the next 12 months, according to economists.

      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs.

      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",
      "Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers.",
      "\"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol \u2014 a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business \u2014 in as chief executive.",
      "In coming aboard in September, Niccol promised\u00a0to elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccol\u00a0said\u00a0during a call with analysts last year.",

      "The Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday that the agency has mailed checks totaling over $18 million to nearly 282,000 PCH consumers who the FTC says were misled by the Jericho, New York, company's \"deceptive and unfair\" practices.",
      "Specifically, regulators alleged in a 2023\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0that PCH used \"dark patterns\" to trick customers into thinking they had to make a purchase to enter the sweepstakes, or increase their odds of winning. The FTC also said PCH sent emails to people with deceptive subject lines suggesting they were related to official government documents, like tax forms.",
      "Christopher Irving, vice president of consumer and legal affairs at PCH, noted in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that, while refund checks are going out now, the FTC's complaint and settlement are from two years ago.",
      "\"While we disagreed with the FTC's assertions at the time, we were glad to have resolved the matter and move forward continuing to do what we do best \u2014 provide consumers fun entertainment and games powered by our famous chance to win,\" he said.",
      "In a 2023 consumer alert after the lawsuit was announced, the FTC reminded Americans that it is illegal for a company to tell people they are required to pay to enter a sweepstakes contest.",
      "Only PCH customers who clicked on one of the allegedly misleading emails and ordered a product are eligible for a refund, the FTC said. Anyone with questions about the refund can call the refund administrator at 1-888-516-0774.",

We're looking for vehicles that will protect the teen in the event of a crash and also help them prevent the crash in the first place.\"",

      "The Journal's report comes after Tesla's first-quarter sales and profit\u00a0took a hit amid a backlash from some consumers about Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Led by Musk, the cost-cutting task force has overseen the mass firings of federal workers, including more than 216,000 government employees terminated from their jobs in March.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-tax-cut-below-200000-income-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 08:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says steep tariffs on U.S. imports will lead to lower taxes for Americans. Is he right?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump describes his administration's sweeping new tariffs on other countries as a tool for accomplishing a range of key economic goals, including reviving U.S. manufacturing. Recently, he's been highlighting another aim: lowering, or even eliminating, individual income taxes for most Americans.",
      "\"When Tariffs cut in, many people's Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" he wrote Sunday on Truth Social, his social media app.",
      "Tariffs are already kicking in, with businesses around the country facing import duties of 145% or more on imports from China and tariffs of 10% on goods shipped from almost every other nation. Many Americans say they disapprove of these import duties, which are typically passed onto consumers through higher prices, and are bracing for higher inflation as the costs trickle through the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments also point to his earlier assertions that higher tariffs could raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenue in the next year or so. On Sunday, before boarding Air Force One to return from Pope Francis' funeral, Mr. Trump asserted that the revenue raised by his tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax\" in the U.S.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether the Trump administration is developing a proposal to cut taxes for most Americans.",
      "What's the link between tariffs and taxes?",
      "Currently, there is no tax bill in Congress \u2014 the arm of government with the authority to change the tax code \u2014 that would eliminate federal income taxes for people earning $200,000 or less. Even so, the House is working on a reconciliation bill that would extend Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add a few new reductions promised by the president on the campaign trail, such as eliminating taxes on employee tips.",
      "If passed, that bill would mean individuals would continue to pay the same tax rates they've paid since Mr. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took effect beginning for the 2018 tax year, with\u00a0individual tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%, depending on a person's income. And if the legislation is enacted, notably, most Americans would see no difference in their federal income tax rate.",
      "\"There is no real connection\" between Mr. Trump's tariffs and lower taxes, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues. \"He has the authority to impose higher tariffs, and he's done that. But he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cut income taxes \u2014 that's done by Congress.\"",
      "There is \"zero chance\" that Congress would eliminate income taxes for a large swath of the U.S. population because the new tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace the $2.4 trillion in income taxes\u00a0paid by American households each year, she added.",
      "Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 or twice the current rate under Mr. Trump \u2014 the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "Why tariffs can't replace income taxes",
      "Even the notion of eliminating income taxes for people earning less than $200,000 doesn't add up, York said. Here's why: Mr. Trump's tariffs could raise about $170 billion in revenue this year, while wiping out individual taxes for people earning less than $200,000 would forego $700 billion in tax revenue this year, she estimated.",
      "\"You would need tariffs multiple times higher than what we have now\" to generate the revenue to make up for the gap in lost taxes, York said. Making the math work is \"an impossibility,\" she added.",
      "Yet hiking taxes even more aggressively would heighten the risks of a U.S. recession, which would cause job losses, inhibit consumer spending, suppress business investment and further roil financial markets \u2014 all developments that reduce the government's tax receipts.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim about tariffs lowering taxes amounts to \"an argument that says, 'If Americans pay more out of their left pocket, the government will be able to put more in their right pocket,'\" said Joe Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, another think tank focused on taxes.",
      "\"Even if you make the math work, it's really replacing one form of tax with another \u2014 and the other important point here is these taxes have very different distributional effects across income types,\" he added.",
      "Translation: Tariffs take a bigger bite out of low- and middle-income Americans' budgets because they spend a larger share of their incomes on basics like food and household goods than compared with high-income Americans. A typical low-income household is likely to see their disposable income fall by 5.5% under Mr. Trump's tariffs, compared with 1.9% for the highest-earning families, according to a March 31\u00a0estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "But faced with higher prices for consumer goods, many households would cut back on spending, adding to the challenges of relying on tariffs to raise enough revenue to replace income taxes, experts say.",
      "Dueling goals",
      "Mr. Trump's move lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1943\u00a0reflects conflicting aims, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For instance, the president has said he wants to use tariffs to secure better trade deals with other nations. Yet reaching new trade pacts with lower tariff rates would undercut the president's goal of relying on import duties to replace the federal income tax.",
      "Mr. Trump's back-and-forth on his tariffs, including temporarily rolling back some import fees and creating exclusions for certain products, also undermines the administration's ability to generate a new source of federal revenue, Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "\"If you are tariffs on, tariffs off, because of these negotiations that are supposedly going on, you're not raising much revenue, or protecting industry or getting new investment the United States because of all the uncertainty,\" Lincicome said.",
      "By dangling the prospect of a tax cut, Mr. Trump may be seeking to convince Americans to bear the brunt of the tariffs' impact, which economists say could slow U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"Americans are about to find out really fast that this is a tax on us,\" York noted. \"It will hurt our trading partners, too, but it is a tax that in large part falls on American businesses and American workers.\"",

      "A 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. took effect on April 3. President Trump announced on Tuesday that he would provide some relief to U.S. automakers by ensuring they are not also levied with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Approximately 90% of the parts in a Hyundai Ioniq 6 sedan with a sticker price of nearly $51,000 on George Glassman's dealership are manufactured in South Korea. Glassman said this is the kind of vehicle that would see its price rise if the tariffs remain in place.",
      "\"No doubt, it would go up,\" Glassman said. \"The question is, to how much it would go up.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies.",
      "The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of products and services \u2014 shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday in its initial GDP estimate. It's the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022, when the economy was in recovery after cratering during the COVID pandemic.",
      "The U.S. economy was forecast to show 0.8% growth in the first three months of 2025, according to the average estimate of economists polled by FactSet.",
      "The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S.\u00a0slipping into a recession in 2025. Although the Trump administration's blanket tariffs were announced on April 2 \u2014 after the end of the quarter \u2014 businesses sought to get ahead of the impact of the import duties by front-loading purchases early in the year.",
      "The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note.",
      "Nevertheless, concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior at year start, signaling that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025, experts said.",
      "\"This artificial front-loading of demand sets the stage for a sharper demand cliff in Q2 \u2014 a far more troubling phase of the ongoing economic slowdown.\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "Yet GDP could get a second-quarter boost as companies import fewer goods in the current quarter due to the rollout of the tariffs and the front-loading at the start of the year, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Another key measure of the economy's health \u2014 known as final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 also rose 3% in the first quarter, edging up from 2.9% in the previous three months. That suggests demand from consumers and businesses remains resilient despite mounting concerns about the economy.",
      "\"Overall, [the GDP data is] not as bad as feared, although some of the drop back in imports in the second quarter will now be partly offset by a slowing in inventory accumulation,\" analysts with the investment advisory firm said in a report. \"We forecast a 2.0% annualized rebound in second-quarter GDP.\"",
      "Impact of DOGE cuts",
      "Growth in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in imports, as well as a 5.1% decline in government spending, the Commerce Department said.",
      "Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, has effectively shuttered major agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and canceled funding for health and science research.",
      "Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies like Walmart or Target. When faced with higher tariffs, companies typically pass on all or some of the costs to shoppers, which can depress consumer spending.",
      "GDP growth is forecast to slow to 1.9% in 2025, according to FactSet. That's down from 2.8% in 2024.",
      "\"[T]he inflation data will show when the price increases of tariffs hit consumers, which will deliver a real income shock that we expect to weigh heavily on spending growth,\" Pearce said.",
      "A miss on ADP employment numbers",
      "Another red flag for the U.S. economy came on Wednesday with the release of ADP's employment numbers for April, which showed private employers added 62,000 jobs this month, far fewer than the 134,000 jobs that had been forecast by economists, according to FactSet.",
      "The monthly jobs report on Friday is expected to show that employers created 135,000 new jobs, a slowdown from 228,000 in March, FactSet data shows.",
      "The combination of weak ADP data, the GDP report and other economic data \"increasingly suggest a recession may have begun,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at trading company TradeStation, in an email.",
      "The shaky economic data could persuade the Federal Reserve to hold off on making more rate cuts, experts said. The central bank will make its next rate decision at its May 7 meeting, with most economists forecasting that the Fed will hold its benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"The data clearly buys the Fed some time to delay cuts; they will likely continue their wait-and-see approach to assess the inflation shocks stemming from the tariffs announced in April,\" Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",

      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent more than $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found for spending through April 29. We will be tracking and updating the spending throughout the year.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "\"If the savings are rather small and the pain is high, DOGE is going to be a liability,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been tracking DOGE's work.",
      "\"If you really want to cut federal spending, you're going to have to cut into the programs where the lion's share of the money is. That's Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and we spend a lot of money on interest,\" Malkus said.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories.",
      "Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The fiscal year ends September 30. There's still a lot more year left so let's see where we are at the end of the year,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "In his work at the American Enterprise Institute, Malkus said his review indicates the savings is more likely to be around $80 billion.",
      "Even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far by DOGE would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent more than $200 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",

And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of which we don't need.\"",
      "U.S. imports of goods made in China expand far beyond toys to include electronics, clothes, household goods, appliances, construction materials and more. The president has said he believes tariffs on Chinese goods will ultimately be substantially lower than 145%.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came hours after the Commerce Department reported U.S. domestic gross product shrank at an 0.3% annual rate in the first quarter of 2025, down from growth of 2.4% at the end of 2024. It was the country's worst quarterly performance since early 2022. Despite taking credit for a strong stock market after his election victory and inauguration, Mr. Trump on Wednesday insisted the new economic numbers had nothing to do with him, and were the fault of his predecessor.",
      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" the president wrote Wednesday on his social media platform Truth Social. \"I didn't take over until January 20th.

      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",
      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "story": [
      "Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply with the Trump administration's steep tariffs in place, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.",
      "The trade war between China and the U.S. has escalated over the past few weeks, with each nation hiking its import duties multiple times in a tit-for-tat. While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China has remained the exception.",
      "U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%. China, meanwhile, has hit back with 125% tariffs on U.S. products.",
      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company. Bookings from other Asia ports, such as Vietnam and Thailand, are up 5% to 10% as some exporters look to expand production outside of China to avoid steep tariffs.",
      "The decline in bookings from China comes during what is usually a busy period for imports to the U.S.",
      "\"We would normally see an increase in bookings across the board, because this is the beginning of the shipping year,\" said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. \"It's when back-to-school items and Halloween items start to come in.\"",
      "What's more, retailers have likely stockpiled sufficient inventory to last a couple of months, Seroka said, adding that come summer, consumers could find that many products are out of stock. All manner of goods flow through the Port of Los Angeles to end up in households across the U.S.",
      "The port's top five import categories are furniture, auto parts, clothing, plastics and footwear, a port spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Empty shelves?",
      "Major retailers and small establishments alike are warning that consumers could soon face tariff-related inventory shortages. Goods that do land on store shelves could be subject to price hikes, once \"tariff surcharges\" are added.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chef economist at private equity firm Apollo Global Management, said in a recent blog post that tariffs will lead to \"empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks and COVID-like shortages for consumers and for firms using Chinese products as intermediate goods.\"",
      "Last week, the CEOs of Walmart and Target privately cautioned\u00a0President Trump that his sweeping tariff policy could lead to gaps on store shelves, if it remains in effect,\u00a0Axios first reported.",
      "\"We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,\" Walmart\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Target also said in a statement that it \"had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "Both retailers had previously publicly warned that the levies could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey\u00a0told CNBC.",
      "Last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell\u00a0told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" as a result of tariffs planned on imports from Mexico.",
      "Widespread booking freeze",
      "Logistics groups are also reporting sharp declines in cargo shipments from China.",
      "For the week of April 14, booking volumes from China to the U.S. dropped 45% compared with the same period one year earlier, according to Vizion, a container tracking service.",
      "\"This dramatic drop aligned with two key developments: the April 4th U.S. tariff announcement, followed by China's retaliatory measures announced on April 5th. The result? A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",
      "Freightos, a freight booking platform, notes that carriers are canceling sailings from China at a fast clip, because they can't fill their ships with goods. Ocean container prices have dropped from $8,100 in July 2024 for a standard 40-foot container, to roughly, $2,327, the group noted.",
      "Many importers are pausing shipments until they gain more clarity into Mr. Trump's tariff plans. A Freightos survey of 195 small importers found that 33% of businesses planned to pause shipments in response to the tariffs.",
      "Kristin Bear, owner of a U.S.-based lingerie company, Kilo Brava, is hoping Mr. Trump softens his stance on tariffs, so that she can continue to manufacture garments in China and import them to the U.S. She can't afford to import goods with 145% tariffs in place, and if they don't come down, \"we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing a report that Amazon plans to display tariff charges on imported goods, called the move \"a hostile and political act.\"",
      "The e-commerce giant plans to display new tariff costs next to products' prices, political news site Punchbowl\u00a0reported earlier Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The move would provide shoppers with clarity into the cost of the new levies on imported goods.",

      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",

      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-college-worth-the-money-heres-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had an annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014 a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2014 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2014 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages of their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

    "summary": "President Trump says he is nominating Mike Waltz to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
    "story": [
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving his White House post, although soon after reports about his departure were published, President Trump announced he plans to nominate him to be ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "It was not clear whether Alex Wong, Waltz's deputy, would remain at the National Security Council, as of Thursday afternoon, sources said.",
      "The president also said in a social media post that in the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as national security adviser. Waltz will need to be confirmed by the Senate for the ambassador role.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.\"",
      "Waltz said on X, \"I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation.\"",
      "It was a last-minute decision to nominate Waltz to be U.N. ambassador, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump decided Thursday morning, the sources said, but there had been previous discussions about moving Waltz out of the NSC.",
      "Rubio and Waltz had a meeting Thursday to discuss the transition in roles, multiple sources told CBS News. It was unclear, even to some senior advisers at State Department and the White House, when exactly Rubio would take over as interim national security adviser.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau was not informed before the news broke that Waltz would be leaving the NSC, sources said, and the circle of people who knew Waltz would be departing was very small.",
      "A number of factors led to the change. It was perceived at the White House that Waltz didn't adequately vet NSC staff, sources said, in addition to the Signal saga and a lack of a good fit between Waltz and the senior team.",
      "But Mr. Trump respects Waltz, sources said, and, unlike some figures in Mr. Trump's first term, Waltz wasn't ousted unceremoniously. He was instead given a high-profile new post. Journalist Mark Halperin first reported the departures.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learned of the president's decision to appoint Rubio interim national security adviser during a briefing she was giving Thursday. Asked by a reporter about how long he might serve in the position, Bruce responded, \"It is clear that I just heard this from you.\"",
      "The president's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, had multiple conversations on the Waltz matter on Thursday, sources said.",
      "In March, Waltz came under scrutiny after he put together a Signal chat and mistakenly included The Atlantic's\u00a0Jeffrey Goldberg, disclosing\u00a0discussions with top national security officials about plans\u00a0for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. Goldberg\u00a0published\u00a0his account, and he initially omitted operational details, but after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied any classified information had been shared on the chat, Goldberg published that information, too, which included the timing of the strikes and the weapons packages used.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, but Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump did not ask him to step down at the time. Publicly, President Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "One source familiar with the situation at the National Security Council said the president thinks sufficient time has passed since the Signal incident that Waltz and Wong's departures could be framed as part of a reorganization. The president had been hesitant to oust Waltz over the perception that doing so could be seen as bending to outside pressure.",
      "Wong, reached by phone, declined to comment.",
      "As Mr. Trump's pick to be ambassador to the U.N., Waltz will face Senate confirmation. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said of Waltz and the Signal incident that he gave him credit \"for acknowledging the huge mistake made with that very sensitive information that if it gotten out, we could have lost pilots.\" Nonetheless, when asked by a reporter about the Senate confirmation hearing Waltz would face as a nominee, Warner replied, \"I think it would be pretty brutal. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas expressed confidence Thursday that Waltz would be confirmed and told reporters, \"I'm glad he's still going to be part of the administration.\"",
      "Wong served in the first Trump administration as deputy special representative for North Korea and also as deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department. In announcing his appointment, Mr. Trump said Wong helped negotiate his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "It is unlikely that U.S. envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff will be tapped for the permanent national security adviser job, two sources said. Speculation among Mr. Trump's allies on Thursday was that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller might be considered, or possibly deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism Seb Gorka, because they are so firmly behind Mr. Trump's mission. Ric Grenell, special presidential envoy for special missions, said publicly that he didn't want the post.",
      "The departures of Waltz and Wong come after at least six NSC staffers were fired in early April. Those previous firings came shortly after right-wing personality Laura Loomer visited the Oval Office and presented Mr. Trump with opposition research on NSC staffers whom she views as neoconservatives or not sufficiently loyal to the president, one source said.",

      "\"I was elected to turn the state's education system around,\" Walters told CBS News. \"We were 49th when I was elected. We're working to move all these things around, and it takes a dramatic shift in education.\"",
      "As he works on addressing that problem, he has also turned a lot of his attention to President Trump's mass deportation plans.",
      "\"We should be utilizing all of our resources to make sure we are supporting what President Trump is wanting to do,\" Walters said.",
      "Earlier this year, the Oklahoma State Board of Education approved a proposal requiring students to submit their immigration status during school enrollment. Walters said he would share that data with federal authorities. The proposal must still receive the approval of the Oklahoma Legislature, which started considering it last week and could vote on it this month.",
      "\"Well, we're following their executive order,\" said Walters, in reference to an executive order Mr. Trump signed immediately after beginning his second term that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to make arrests near schools and places of worship. \"So, when you have an executive order that says, no longer will churches and schools not give over information that they're asked for, we took that seriously in Oklahoma. So we began to implement it. Well, if you need to get information from us and from our schools, you have to first collect the information.\"",
      "Walters' position on the issue has angered some students and teachers in the state. A visit to Carnegie Elementary School in Tulsa in late January drew dozens of protesters.",
      "But one of Walters' loudest and most surprising critics is conservative Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who first met Walters at a tennis match and helped launch his political career.",
      "He doesn't believe the Trump administration is actually requesting the immigration status of students.",
      "\"Every time I've heard President Trump talk about this, he's talking about making sure we know who's coming in our country,\" Stitt told CBS News. \"And then also making sure that we get the criminal element out. I've never once heard him say, 'I want to go gather up 8-year-olds' immigration status.\"",
      "When asked about the issue, a White House official told CBS News that it doesn't want undocumented immigrants \"or gangs to take refuge and hide out in schools or churches because they know law enforcement can't go inside.\"",
      "The official added that it is \"not a directive\" for Department of Homeland Security agents \"to go into a school or church.\"",
      "\"Our agents use discretion,\" the official said. \"They would also need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a church or a school. We expect these to be extremely rare.\"",
      "The governor, meanwhile, has replaced three Oklahoma State Board of Education members after Walters proposed checking students' immigration status.\u00a0 \u00a0\"When I found that out, I was going to pull every lever I could to unwind that rule,\" Stitt said.",
      "Walters couldn't disagree more.",
      "\"The governor's absolutely dead wrong on this,\" countered Walters, who said Stitt's position on the immigration status won't perturb him.",
      "\"No, look, we're going to move forward with what we're doing,\" Walters said. \"The reality is we are following executive orders.\"",

    "story": [
      "The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border unlawfully continued to be at a historically low level in April, three full months into President Trump's aggressive efforts to curtail illegal immigration, according to internal federal data obtained by CBS News.",
      "In April, Border Patrol agents recorded roughly 8,400 apprehensions of migrants who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security statistics, which have not been officially published.",
      "April's preliminary tally, which could be adjusted once the data is officially published, is a slight increase from March, when Border Patrol recorded 7,200 apprehensions at the southern border. And it is nearly identical to the 8,300 apprehensions the agency recorded there in February.",
      "The number of illegal crossings during Mr. Trump's first three full months in office represents a seismic change at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The apprehensions reported in February, March and April are the lowest tallies recorded by the Border Patrol in its public monthly dataset, which stretches back to fiscal year 2000. The last time Border Patrol averaged fewer than 9,000 monthly apprehensions along the southern border over a year was in the late 1960s, according to historical agency figures.",
      "The historically low levels of illegal crossings under Mr. Trump also stand in sharp contrast to the unprecedented influx in migrant arrivals at the southern border under the Biden administration. During a record-breaking spike in illegal crossings in December 2023, Border Patrol averaged 8,000 apprehensions per day, with the agency processing over 10,000 migrants on some days.",
      "Driving the dramatic drop in illegal entries at the southern border, Trump administration officials have argued, is the president's far-reaching immigration crackdown.",
      "Arguing that the country is facing an \"invasion,\" the president has all but shuttered the American asylum system, authorizing U.S. border officials to rapidly deport migrants to Mexico or their home countries, without court hearings. Thousands of additional active-duty troops have been deployed to fortify the southern border and, in some cases, detain migrants.",
      "The Trump administration has also dismantled Biden-era programs that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally, arguing that the policies were contrary to federal immigration law.",
      "In the interior of the country, the administration has dramatically broadened who is eligible to be arrested and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, reversing Biden-era rules that largely limited immigration arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals.",
      "In some cases, the administration has flown migrant detainees to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, as well as to El Salvador, where nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members remain detained at a notorious mega-prison.",
      "Many Democrats have denounced Mr. Trump's immigration policies as draconian and inhumane, arguing they have trampled on migrants' due process rights. Nearly every single major immigration and border policy enacted by the president faces legal challenges by Democratic-led states and advocates who argue the changes violate U.S laws, including obligations to asylum-seekers fleeing persecution.",
      "Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, who studies U.S. immigration policies at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and actions are likely contributing to migrants rethinking plans to cross the U.S. border.",
      "Putzel-Kavanaugh said it's \"one thing to be sent back to your home country if you have a fear, but to be sent to a high-security prison in El Salvador is an entirely different threat.\"",
      "Migration to the southern border, Putzel-Kavanaugh added, began dropping last year, after the Biden administration convinced Mexican officials to stop more U.S.-bound migrants. Unlawful border crossings dropped further after President Biden sharply restricted asylum through an executive order in June 2024.",
      "Putzel-Kavanaugh cautioned that migration patterns can change rapidly, noting that crossings appear to have plateaued since the massive plunge in Mr. Trump's first weeks in office. Still, the U.S.-Mexico border remains the quietest it has been in decades.",
      "Rolando Salinas, the Democratic mayor of Eagle Pass, Texas, said his border town was \"ground zero\" during the migration crisis faced by the Biden administration.

      "Washington \u2014 Chris Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during President Trump's first term, has had his membership in the Global Entry traveler program revoked, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Thursday.",
      "The move comes after Mr. Trump issued a memorandum last month that targeted Krebs for defending the integrity of the 2020 election, which the president has continued to baselessly claim was rigged against him. The directive instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to suspend security clearances held by Krebs and people working at entities associated with him, including at the cybersecurity company where he worked.",
      "Krebs, a CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst,\u00a0told the Wall Street Journal last month that he was resigning from that company, SentinelOne.",
      "Mr. Trump's memo also directed his administration to investigate Krebs' activities from his time in the federal government, including at CISA.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CBS News that Krebs is \"under active investigation by law enforcement agencies. That is a fact disqualifying him for Global Entry.\" CNN first reported that Krebs' Global Entry membership had been rescinded.",
      "Global Entry is a program run by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection that allows expedited clearance for travelers arriving in the U.S. who are pre-approved and low-risk. A person may not be eligible for the Global Entry program if they are the subject of an ongoing federal, state or local law enforcement agency, according to CBP.",
      "Krebs was fired by Mr. Trump in 2020 after he refuted the president's unsupported claims that the election was rife was widespread voter fraud. CISA had released a joint statement days after the Nov. 3, 2020, election saying that it was the \"most secure in American history\" and that there was \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\"",
      "In announcing his decision to remove Krebs from his role as CISA director, Mr. Trump claimed the statement was \"highly inaccurate.\" While the president and his campaign mounted dozens of lawsuits challenging the integrity of the 2020 election, none were successful and claims of widespread fraud were refuted, including by Mr. Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has continued to claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him and has undertaken numerous actions to take revenge against his political adversaries and critics now that he is back in the White House. In addition to Krebs, the president has signed executive orders punishing major law firms that employed former special counsel Robert Mueller and members of his team, even though they no longer work there.",
      "He has also directed his administration to take away security clearances held by former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his opponents in the 2024 and 2016 elections, respectively, and Biden, as well as members of his administration.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to wade into its effort to terminate the Temporary Protected Status program protecting roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. from deportation.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked the designation in February, which would have cleared the way for the migrants to lose their government-issued work permits and deportations protections on April 7. But a federal judge in California agreed to delay the move in late March and said her decision to terminate the TPS program for the Venezuelan migrants appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes.\"",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide emergency relief to the Trump administration and pause the district court's order, leading the Trump administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "\"So long as the order is in effect, the secretary must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is 'contrary to the national interest,'\" Solicitor General John Sauer wrote in the administration's emergency appeal with the high court.",
      "Congress in 1990 established the program that allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Venezuela for the Temporary Protected Status program, citing \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that prevented Venezuelans in the U.S. from returning to their home country. Mayorkas extended the designation in 2023 and then again just before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "But after Mr. Trump took office for his second term, Noem vacated that extension, finding that it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the program. The termination was set to take effect April 7.",
      "TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance filed a lawsuit in February challenging Noem's decision, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled in their favor and postponed Noem's termination from taking effect nationwide. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit then declined to pause that order.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said the district court's injunction \"wrested control of the nation's immigration policy away from the Executive Branch and imposed the court's own perception.\"",
      "\"The district court's decision undermines the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" he wrote, calling the lower court's order \"ill-considered.\"",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Trump administration is one of nearly a dozen involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda that has landed before the Supreme Court. The decision to end the TPS program for Venezuelans is also among a bevy of actions taken by the Trump administration as part of its sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and efforts to restrict the relief that allows some migrants to come to the U.S. and stay.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Less than two months after President Trump's inauguration, the Republican-led Senate\u00a0 confirmed nearly every one of his Cabinet nominees.",
      "But a vote has yet to be scheduled for the final nominee, the president's pick to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York was poised to fill the role before Mr. Trump pulled her nomination, citing House Republicans' slim majority and needing her vote to help advance his agenda. Mr. Trump said in May\u00a0he would move Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, to the position.",
      "There are 22 Cabinet positions, each requiring Senate confirmation. CBS News also included the divisive vote for FBI director, which is not a Cabinet role, in our tally.",
      "Republicans largely fell in line, even after some expressed concern about Mr. Trump's more controversial picks, while few Democrats were willing to give them their stamp of approval, especially as the president moved to overhaul the federal agencies that these nominees oversee.",
      "Here's how members of each party voted:",
      "A handful of Democrats supported nearly half of the nominees. Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire each voted for 10 of Mr. Trump's nominees.",
      "Ten Democrats supported only one of Mr. Trump's picks \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who represented Florida in the Senate before his confirmation. Rubio was confirmed hours after Mr. Trump was sworn in and was the only nominee to receive unanimous support. But at least two of the Democrats who only voted for Rubio \u2014 Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland \u2014 have since said they regretted backing him, given the Trump administration's treatment of Ukraine.",
      "Besides Rubio, seven other nominees received significant support from Democrats: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "See more here on how each Democrat voted for every nominee.",
      "Only five of the 53 Republicans in the upper chamber defected to vote against at least one of the president's nominees.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky led the pack with four \"no\" votes. He voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also voted against Hegseth, forcing Vice President JD Vance to cast a tie-breaking vote. Collins and Murkowski also withheld their support from Kash Patel, who was narrowly confirmed as FBI director.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who isn't afraid to buck his party, voted against Jamieson Greer as U.S. trade representative and Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "Sen. Ted Budd of North Carolina cast his only \"no\" vote against Chavez-DeRemer.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 14:25:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The Department of Health and Human Services said it is redirecting funding from what it calls a wasteful Biden-era project on next-generation COVID vaccines.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has transferred $500 million from research into next-generation COVID-19 vaccines, redirecting the money to a single vaccine project linked to the Trump administration's former acting head of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said they were surprised by the announcement, which bypassed the usual procedures overseen by career scientists at the NIH and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA. Those reviews are intended to ensure that federal research money goes to the projects with the greatest scientific merit.",
      "The HHS says the initiative, dubbed \"Generation Gold Standard,\" aims to start clinical trials next year for universal influenza vaccines that could protect against any strain of the virus. It hopes to get a vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration by 2029.",
      "All of the money is being transferred to an influenza vaccine project called beta-propiolactone or BPL, according to emails seen by CBS News. Two officials said the decision to pour $500 million into a single vaccine platform is unusual, given the limited data on it.",
      "The transfer makes it effectively one of the largest awards to date from a BARDA effort to speed funding to new experimental vaccines and treatments, topping a previous award of $452 million to a company developing an experimental oral COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News that \"decision-making for project Generation Gold Standard was a collaborative process, between leaders of HHS, in an effort to direct funding for a BPL vaccine for all influenza threats, not just one.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal previously reported news of the project.",
      "The vaccine underwent testing for safety results earlier this year in a small study led by NIH researchers Dr. Matthew Memoli and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger. The research was what scientists call a Phase 1 study, the first step to researching a potential vaccine in humans.",
      "Memoli had served as the acting head of the NIH during a controversial transition in recent months, overseeing Trump administration directives like steep cuts to research funding and the medical research agency's staff and leadership.",
      "Taubenberger, who holds a patent for the BPL vaccine platform, was picked to be the acting head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, after the institute's previous director was ousted.",
      "BARDA and NIH officials were ordered to redirect the money to Memoli's research by Noah Miller, a special assistant hired by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to emails seen by CBS News. Two officials said it was unusual for a political appointee to handpick a project or researcher to be funded without vetting from career scientists or outside review.",
      "The money is coming from the \"Project NextGen\" initiative, a $5 billion effort launched under the Biden administration that had previously funded multiple research projects into studying potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.",
      "The NIH had previously awarded $62.4 million in grant money to researchers at seven universities working on \"pan-coronavirus\" vaccines.",
      "From BARDA, the department had also backed four vaccine makers going into larger Phase 2B clinical trials to study experimental COVID-19 vaccines, in awards totaling $551 million.",
      "Those followed requests by the NIH and BARDA for researchers and vaccine companies to submit proposals for backing from the federal government.",
      "Another HHS spokesperson, Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, said in an email that the department's new initiative \"realigns BARDA with its core mission: preparing for all flu viral pathogens, not just COVID-19.\"",
      "\"It delivers a cost-effective, accountable alternative to the Biden administration's wasteful Project NextGen, which spent $1.63 billion on COVID-19 vaccines and $1.19 billion on therapeutics, neglecting broader pandemic preparedness,\" Feliciano said.",
      "In its release, the department described the decision as a \"decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness,\" by focusing on \"in-house development\" of vaccines instead of projects from outside researchers.",
      "It is also planning to develop other vaccines for COVID-19 using BPL, which it calls \"traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.\"",
      "\"Our commitment is clear: every innovation in vaccine development must be grounded in gold standard science and transparency, and subjected to the highest standards of safety and efficacy testing,\" Kennedy said.",

    "story": [
      "Senior U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton on Wednesday dismissed criminal charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, a Virginia man accused of being a regional leader of the violent MS-13 gang, clearing the way for expedited deportation proceedings.",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department asked the court to drop the charges, indicating the government planned to deport Villatoro Santos. A U.S. marshal from the Fugitive Task Force was in the courtroom, suggesting Villatoro Santos could be transferred into immigration custody after the hearing.",
      "\"They're likely to take him very quickly,\" Villatoro Santo defense attorney, Muhammad Elsayed, said after the hearing.",
      "Villatoro Santos's arrest was announced last month in a nationally televised news conference featuring Attorney General Pam Bondi, who alleged he was the \"East Coast leader\" of the MS-13 transnational gang. He was accused of unspecified violent crimes and helping to lead the gang's criminal attacks across the country. But as the Justice Department has pursued the dismissal of charges against Villatoro Santos, it has not publicly tied him to any acts of violence. His attorneys have repeatedly questioned the nature of the proceedings.",
      "\"This is an unusual case,\" Elsayed said in court, emphasizing that it was up to the court \"to determine whether the motion was made in good faith.\" He argued that the Justice Department had provided \"no explanation whatsoever\" for withdrawing the charges and questioned the lack of clarity regarding what legal process would follow.",
      "\"There will likely be additional proceedings,\" Elsayed said after the hearing.",
      "Villatoro Santos was facing a federal felony gun possession charge in Virginia. Charging documents in his criminal case made only a fleeting reference to MS-13. An immigration officer's affidavit said, \"FBI agents and TFOs also observed indicia of MS-13 association in the garage bedroom\" of Villatoro-Santo's home.",
      "Villatoros Santo's attorney accused the Justice Department of misusing Rule 48(a) \u2014 the procedural tool used to dismiss the indictment \u2014 arguing it amounted to an attempt to bypass due-process protections. \"They want to deport him without due process,\" Elsayed said, referencing statements by Bondi and criticizing the lack of input from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"The court has to dig deeper than just the basic motion,\" Elsayed argued, alleging \"prosecutorial harassment\" and drawing parallels to other politically sensitive case dismissals, including that of New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\"The DOJ did not seek to remove this case without knowing what's coming next,\" Elsayed said, warning of a potential \"unlawful deportation\" and citing past instances when the administration had \"defied court orders\" in deportation cases.",
      "Government attorneys countered that the defense had already delayed the case beyond its initial request, arguing, \"The defendant cannot continue to tread water on the criminal docket.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 12:58:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Trump administration cannot rely on the wartime Alien Enemies Act to detain or remove from the U.S. a group of Venezuelan migrants who are being held at a facility in southern Texas.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by President Trump in his first term, is a significant setback for the president as he seeks to crack down on illegal immigration into the U.S. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, but Rodriguez's order permanently blocks the administration from using the AEA and Mr. Trump's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in the Southern District.",
      "Rodriguez's order clarifies that his permanent injunction does not prohibit administration officials from moving forward with removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "\"The question that this lawsuit presents is whether the president can utilize a specific statute, the AEA, to detain and remove Venezuelan aliens who are members of TdA,\" Rodriguez wrote. \"As to that question, the historical record renders clear that the president's invocation of the AEA through the proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms.\"",
      "As a result of that finding, the judge said that the executive branch cannot use Mr. Trump's invocation of the AEA through his proclamation to detain or deport the Venezuelan migrants in southern Texas.",
      "The Trump administration, Rodriguez wrote in a 36-page opinion, does \"not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\" The decision is likely to be appealed.",
      "\"The court ruled that the president lacks authority simply to declare that there's been an invasion of the U.S.\u00a0 and then invoke an 18th Century wartime authority during peacetime,\" Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the Venezuelan migrants, said in a statement. \"Congress never meant for this law to be used in this manner and the court correctly ruled that the president's actions are subject to judicial scrutiny.\"",
      "Enacted in 1798, the Alien Enemies Act allows the president to assert broad powers when there is a \"declared war\" or when \"any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted to threatened\" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government.",
      "The law has only been invoked three times, and all during periods of declared wars. But Mr. Trump's March proclamation claimed that the gang Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" The measure claimed that the gang is undertaking \"hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare\" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as \"alien enemies.\"",
      "Shortly after the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act, three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas, who were subject to removal because of the proclamation, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., seeking to block the move.",
      "That lawsuit set off a series of events that played out in March and led the Supreme Court to allow removals under the Alien Enemies Act. But crucially, the high court said Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration were entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained.",
      "As a result of that decision, the three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle facility sought relief in the Southern District of Texas. While they did not take issue with their detention, they challenged the Trump administration's ability to deport them based on the president's proclamation and the Alien Enemies Act, and denied being members of Tren De Aragua.",
      "In granting the Venezuelan migrants relief, Rodriguez said that a presidential declaration invoking the Alien Enemies Act must include \"sufficient factual statements\" or refer to other pronouncements that allow a court to determine whether the alleged actions satisfy the conditions to apply the law.",
      "\"Allowing the president to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch's authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute's scope. The law does not support such a position,\" he wrote.",
      "Rodriguez also found that \"invasion\" and \"predatory incursion,\" as used in the law, \"must involve an organized, armed force entering the United States to engage in conduct destructive of property and human life in a specific geographical area.\" That action, however, does not need to be a precursor to an actual war, the judge said.",
      "\"As for the activities of the Venezuelan-directed TdA in the United States, and as described in the proclamation, the court concludes that they do not fall within the plain, ordinary meaning of 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' for purposes of the AEA,\" Rodriguez wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's attempted use of the Alien Enemies Act has sparked similar challenges in judicial districts across the country where Venezuelan migrants facing removal under the president's proclamation are being detained. Federal judges in New York and Colorado have temporarily blocked deportations relying on the 225-year-old law while proceedings continue.",
      "The clash involving the migrants in South Texas, initially brought in Washington, D.C., led a judge there to find probable cause to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. That finding arose from what the judge said was immigration officials' defiance of an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act that was bound for El Salvador.",
      "The White House has repeatedly attacked federal judges for their orders in cases involving his crackdown on immigration.",

      "Harris gave the keynote address at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that assists Democratic women in running for office.",
      "In her speech, which comes on the heels of\u00a0Mr. Trump's 100th day in office, Harris took aim at her former opponent, saying that \"instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals.\"",
      "Harris said that the Trump administration and his allies are \"counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others.\"",
      "Harris called Mr. Trump's trade war the \"greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history,\" describing the president's tariffs as \"reckless.\"",
      "Harris said the tariffs instituted by the Trump administration have \"hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials\" and are paralyzing \"American businesses, large and small, forcing them to lay off people, to stop hiring or pause investment decisions.\"",
      "She later added that \"the tariffs, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.\"",
      "\"But please, let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. It may feel like that,\" Harris said. \"But understand: What we are, in fact, witnessing is a high velocity event, where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.\"",
      "Harris also touched on Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, saying \"it is not OK to detain or disappear American citizens without due process.\"",
      "The Trump administration has faced ongoing controversy over the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.",

      "The former vice president praised \"the courage of judges to uphold the rule of law in the face of those who would jail them,\" a reference to the federal arrest of a Wisconsin judge last week accused of obstructing immigration agents.",
      "Harris ended her speech by acknowledging that \"things are going to get worse before they get better,\" but called on Americans to \"stand together\" and \"gear up for the hard work ahead.\"",
      "\"Always remember: This country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to we the people.\"",

      "With Gov. Gavin Newsom terming out of the governor's office in 2026, Harris' name has been floated as a possible candidate to become California's next chief executive. Some polling has shown Harris garnering strong support for a run.",

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "summary": "An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate fell short Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in opposition.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat.\"",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

      "Ukrainian and U.S. officials have signed a joint economic investment deal that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earths minerals, the Treasury Department\u00a0announced Wednesday.",
      "A Treasury Department press release said the two countries have agreed to establish a \"United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund,\" referring to it as an \"economic partnership.\" The statement did not include more detail about the agreement.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, confirmed that she signed the deal. In a series of posts on X written in Ukrainian, she described it as a 50/50 partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. She said the deal would be funded through direct investment, future U.S. aid and revenue from new mineral licensing deals \u2014 and does not set up any Ukrainian debt obligations.",
      "According to a Ukrainian fact sheet, the U.S. would contribute to the fund \"either through direct financial input or through new military assistance,\" and the agreement \"focuses on further, not past U.S. military assistance.\" Ukraine would contribute 50% of any royalties from future \u2014 but not existing \u2014 oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine would hold onto ownership of its natural resources, and the fund can only be invested in resource and infrastructure projects within Ukraine. Profits from the fund would be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, and can be \"distributed between the partners\" after that, the fact sheet also said.",
      "An official at the Development Finance Corporation \u2014 a U.S. government agency helping to oversee the deal \u2014 said the joint fund will \"make strategic investments in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, natural resources, and natural resources-related infrastructure in Ukraine, which will help diversify and secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security.\"",
      "The fund will also \"select vital critical minerals to the United States for offtake,\" the official said.",
      "President Trump had\u00a0pressed\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about an economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's minerals, framing it as a way of paying the U.S. back for aiding the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia. Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's reserves of rare earth elements, which are used in electronics, defense technology and energy projects. Some of the country's reserves are located in parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in an interview with NewsNation late Wednesday. \"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have,\" Trump said, of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves.",
      "Zelenskyy initially traveled to Washington in February to sign a mineral deal with Mr. Trump. Those plans were\u00a0derailed\u00a0after an explosive Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance. During the meeting, Vance accused Zelenskyy of being\u00a0insufficiently grateful\u00a0for U.S. military aid.",
      "Negotiations continued despite the public acrimony. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting the U.S. was prepared to sign a deal, but Ukraine had requested \"last minute changes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has cast the mineral deal as a key part of his broader gambit to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.",
      "Those talks have proven rocky: At least twice in recent weeks, Trump administration officials have threatened to pull out of negotiations unless more progress is made. Mr. Trump has lashed out at Zelenskyy repeatedly, calling him a \"dictator\" earlier this year and accusing him last week of prolonging the war by refusing to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. The two leaders held a private meeting Saturday in the Vatican while attending the funeral of Pope Francis.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has threatened to tighten sanctions on Russia unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a deal. Russia launched deadly strikes last week on Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv, angering Mr. Trump, who posted \"Vladimir, STOP!\" on Truth Social.",

    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "CBS News covered the spill for four months, from the frantic efforts to cap the well to bungled attempts to stop the rust-colored crude oil from poisoning beaches and wetlands. The town of Grand Isle was stuck in the muck of disaster. Mayor David Camardelle fought back tears in an interview on the beach, fearful of the future for local fishermen.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:39:24 -0400",
    "summary": "A large brood of periodical cicadas is due to emerge in the spring of 2025. These maps show where people should expect to see and hear the bugs this year.",
    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",

      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "summary": "A notably large brood of periodical cicadas will emerge from the underground across parts of the eastern U.S. this spring.",
    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees.

    "story": [
      "For nearly a decade, Bree Smith was a familiar face in Nashville. But, in January, the mom and former TV meteorologist stopped appearing on the local CBS-affiliated station \u2014 a decision she made after months of fighting against deepfakes, which are simulated online images or videos that can seem realistic.",
      "In Smith's case, an image of her was doctored to create explicit pictures and videos, with her face edited onto different, partly nude bodies, and then used to try to extort money from others. \"Sextortion\" scams like this one have targeted tens of thousands of Americans in the past year alone, according to the FBI.",
      "\"I cry myself to sleep most nights, mostly because I don't want my kids to see me,\" said Smith, who is 43. She recalled first learning about the images in an email, which included a screen grab of an exchange between the sender and an \"impersonator\" posing as the doctored version of her on the internet.",
      "The deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars, and targeting anyone who might recognize Smith. She began to keep track of new accounts using the deepfake in a Google spreadsheet \u2014 and added 24 over the course of just one week, among hundreds that she says have emerged online. A fabricated video also surfaced where a deepfake claims to be Smith.",
      "\"You're basically taking someone's identity,\" she said. \"You're weaponizing them.\"",
      "Smith has become a vocal advocate for regulations that could empower sextortion victims to fight back against their offenders. And last week, a bill Smith backed passed in the Tennessee Senate. The bill, called the \"Preventing Deepfake Images Act,\" was sent to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is expected to sign it into law. It provides a path for people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent.",
      "\"These imposters are trying to take my story, and my story is mine,\" Smith said. \"This is my life. I'm 43 years old and I have worked hard and I have loved well, and I'm not going to just roll over and take this.\"",
      "She said \"defining it as illegal is a critical first step,\" but that work still needs to be done, such as figuring out how to stop it and hold people accountable.",
      "As the bill worked its way through the Tennessee legislature, Smith appeared last month before the Tennessee House Criminal Justice Subcommittee to share her experience with deepfakes and the ways in which the scam has impacted her and her family. In her testimony to lawmakers, she said deepfake accounts pretending to be her have shown up on Facebook and Instagram, in quantities too large for her to find and report as an individual person, CBS News affiliate WSMV reported.",
      "\"I try my best to catch the imposters and block them, but like I said, there have been hundreds of them. It's like whack a mole, they just appear everywhere,\" Smith told lawmakers. \"I'm just supposed to look at them and say, 'nothing we can do, bud?'\"",

      "The president also said in a social media post that in the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as national security adviser. Waltz will need to be confirmed by the Senate for the ambassador role.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.\"",
      "Waltz said on X, \"I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation.\"",
      "It was a last-minute decision to nominate Waltz to be U.N. ambassador, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump decided Thursday morning, the sources said, but there had been previous discussions about moving Waltz out of the NSC.",
      "Rubio and Waltz had a meeting Thursday to discuss the transition in roles, multiple sources told CBS News. It was unclear, even to some senior advisers at State Department and the White House, when exactly Rubio would take over as interim national security adviser.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau was not informed before the news broke that Waltz would be leaving the NSC, sources said, and the circle of people who knew Waltz would be departing was very small.",
      "A number of factors led to the change. It was perceived at the White House that Waltz didn't adequately vet NSC staff, sources said, in addition to the Signal saga and a lack of a good fit between Waltz and the senior team.",
      "But Mr. Trump respects Waltz, sources said, and, unlike some figures in Mr. Trump's first term, Waltz wasn't ousted unceremoniously. He was instead given a high-profile new post. Journalist Mark Halperin first reported the departures.",

Asked by a reporter about how long he might serve in the position, Bruce responded, \"It is clear that I just heard this from you.\"",

Goldberg\u00a0published\u00a0his account, and he initially omitted operational details, but after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied any classified information had been shared on the chat, Goldberg published that information, too, which included the timing of the strikes and the weapons packages used.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, but Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump did not ask him to step down at the time. Publicly, President Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "One source familiar with the situation at the National Security Council said the president thinks sufficient time has passed since the Signal incident that Waltz and Wong's departures could be framed as part of a reorganization. The president had been hesitant to oust Waltz over the perception that doing so could be seen as bending to outside pressure.",
      "Wong, reached by phone, declined to comment.",
      "As Mr. Trump's pick to be ambassador to the U.N., Waltz will face Senate confirmation. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said of Waltz and the Signal incident that he gave him credit \"for acknowledging the huge mistake made with that very sensitive information that if it gotten out, we could have lost pilots.\" Nonetheless, when asked by a reporter about the Senate confirmation hearing Waltz would face as a nominee, Warner replied, \"I think it would be pretty brutal. Let's see what happens.\"",

    "summary": "Jeffrey Hutchinson\u200b, 62, was the fourth person executed this year in Florida under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, with a fifth execution set for May 15.",
    "story": [
      "An Army combat veteran whose Gulf War experience triggered severe mental problems was executed Thursday evening in Florida for the 1998 shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children.",
      "Jeffrey Hutchinson, 62, was pronounced dead at 8:15 p.m. following a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. He was the fourth person executed this year in Florida under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, with a fifth execution set for May 15.",
      "Hutchinson had no last statement but appeared to be mumbling to himself as the procedure started just before 8 p.m. His legs shook sporadically and he seemed to have body spasms for several minutes, then was still. The process took a little more than 15 minutes.",
      "The execution was carried out soon after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal without comment.",
      "Hutchinson had long claimed he was innocent and that two unknown assailants perpetrated the killings under a U.S. government conspiracy aimed at silencing his activism on claims including Gulf War illnesses involving veterans. Hutchinson served eight years in the Army, part of it as an elite Ranger.",
      "Court records, however, showed that on the night of the killings in Crestview, Florida, Hutchinson argued with his girlfriend, 32-year-old Renee Flaherty, then packed his clothes and guns into a truck. Hutchinson went to a bar and drank some beer, telling staff there that Flaherty was angry with him before leaving abruptly.",
      "A short time later, a male caller told a 911 operator, \"I just shot my family\" from the house Hutchinson and Flaherty shared with the three children: 9-year-old Geoffrey, 7-year-old Amanda, and 4-year-old Logan. All were killed with a 12-gauge shotgun that was found on a kitchen counter. Hutchinson was located by police in the garage with a phone still connected to the 911 center and gunshot residue on his hands.",
      "At his 2001 trial, Hutchinson's defense was based on his claim that two unknown men came to the house, killing Flaherty and the children after he struggled with them. A jury found Hutchinson guilty of four counts of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to life in prison for Flaherty's killing and received three death sentences for the children.",
      "Hutchinson had filed numerous unsuccessful appeals, many focused on mental health problems linked to his Army service. In late April, his lawyers sought to delay his execution by claiming Hutchinson was insane and therefore could not be put to death.",
      "Bradford County Circuit Judge James Colaw rejected that argument in an April 27 order.",
      "\"This Court finds that Mr. Hutchinson's purported delusion is demonstrably false. Jeffrey Hutchinson does not lack the mental capacity to understand the reason for the pending execution,\" the judge wrote.",
      "In their court filings, Hutchinson's lawyers said he suffered from Gulf War Illness \u2014 a series of health problems stemming from the 1990-1991 war in Iraq \u2014 as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia related to his claim that he had been targeted by government surveillance.",
      "Florida's lethal injection protocol uses a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",
      "So far this year 15 people have been executed in the U.S. including Hutchinson. A fifth Florida execution is scheduled May 15 for Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing a woman at a motel in 1997. Rogers also was convicted of another woman's murder in California and is believed by investigators to have killed others around the country.",

      "Former high school teacher Ryan Walters was elected Oklahoma state superintendent of schools in 2022, but more than two years later, the state still ranks 49th in education.",
      "\"I was elected to turn the state's education system around,\" Walters told CBS News. \"We were 49th when I was elected. We're working to move all these things around, and it takes a dramatic shift in education.\"",
      "As he works on addressing that problem, he has also turned a lot of his attention to President Trump's mass deportation plans.",
      "\"We should be utilizing all of our resources to make sure we are supporting what President Trump is wanting to do,\" Walters said.",
      "Earlier this year, the Oklahoma State Board of Education approved a proposal requiring students to submit their immigration status during school enrollment. Walters said he would share that data with federal authorities. The proposal must still receive the approval of the Oklahoma Legislature, which started considering it last week and could vote on it this month.",
      "\"Well, we're following their executive order,\" said Walters, in reference to an executive order Mr. Trump signed immediately after beginning his second term that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to make arrests near schools and places of worship. \"So, when you have an executive order that says, no longer will churches and schools not give over information that they're asked for, we took that seriously in Oklahoma. So we began to implement it. Well, if you need to get information from us and from our schools, you have to first collect the information.\"",
      "Walters' position on the issue has angered some students and teachers in the state. A visit to Carnegie Elementary School in Tulsa in late January drew dozens of protesters.",
      "But one of Walters' loudest and most surprising critics is conservative Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who first met Walters at a tennis match and helped launch his political career.",
      "He doesn't believe the Trump administration is actually requesting the immigration status of students.",
      "\"Every time I've heard President Trump talk about this, he's talking about making sure we know who's coming in our country,\" Stitt told CBS News. \"And then also making sure that we get the criminal element out. I've never once heard him say, 'I want to go gather up 8-year-olds' immigration status.\"",
      "When asked about the issue, a White House official told CBS News that it doesn't want undocumented immigrants \"or gangs to take refuge and hide out in schools or churches because they know law enforcement can't go inside.\"",
      "The official added that it is \"not a directive\" for Department of Homeland Security agents \"to go into a school or church.\"",
      "\"Our agents use discretion,\" the official said. \"They would also need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a church or a school. We expect these to be extremely rare.\"",
      "The governor, meanwhile, has replaced three Oklahoma State Board of Education members after Walters proposed checking students' immigration status.\u00a0 \u00a0\"When I found that out, I was going to pull every lever I could to unwind that rule,\" Stitt said.",
      "Walters couldn't disagree more.",
      "\"The governor's absolutely dead wrong on this,\" countered Walters, who said Stitt's position on the immigration status won't perturb him.",
      "\"No, look, we're going to move forward with what we're doing,\" Walters said. \"The reality is we are following executive orders.\"",

    "story": [
      "The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border unlawfully continued to be at a historically low level in April, three full months into President Trump's aggressive efforts to curtail illegal immigration, according to internal federal data obtained by CBS News.",
      "In April, Border Patrol agents recorded roughly 8,400 apprehensions of migrants who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security statistics, which have not been officially published.",
      "April's preliminary tally, which could be adjusted once the data is officially published, is a slight increase from March, when Border Patrol recorded 7,200 apprehensions at the southern border. And it is nearly identical to the 8,300 apprehensions the agency recorded there in February.",
      "The number of illegal crossings during Mr. Trump's first three full months in office represents a seismic change at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The apprehensions reported in February, March and April are the lowest tallies recorded by the Border Patrol in its public monthly dataset, which stretches back to fiscal year 2000. The last time Border Patrol averaged fewer than 9,000 monthly apprehensions along the southern border over a year was in the late 1960s, according to historical agency figures.",
      "The historically low levels of illegal crossings under Mr. Trump also stand in sharp contrast to the unprecedented influx in migrant arrivals at the southern border under the Biden administration. During a record-breaking spike in illegal crossings in December 2023, Border Patrol averaged 8,000 apprehensions per day, with the agency processing over 10,000 migrants on some days.",
      "Driving the dramatic drop in illegal entries at the southern border, Trump administration officials have argued, is the president's far-reaching immigration crackdown.",
      "Arguing that the country is facing an \"invasion,\" the president has all but shuttered the American asylum system, authorizing U.S. border officials to rapidly deport migrants to Mexico or their home countries, without court hearings. Thousands of additional active-duty troops have been deployed to fortify the southern border and, in some cases, detain migrants.",
      "The Trump administration has also dismantled Biden-era programs that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally, arguing that the policies were contrary to federal immigration law.",
      "In the interior of the country, the administration has dramatically broadened who is eligible to be arrested and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, reversing Biden-era rules that largely limited immigration arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals.",
      "In some cases, the administration has flown migrant detainees to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, as well as to El Salvador, where nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members remain detained at a notorious mega-prison.",
      "Many Democrats have denounced Mr. Trump's immigration policies as draconian and inhumane, arguing they have trampled on migrants' due process rights. Nearly every single major immigration and border policy enacted by the president faces legal challenges by Democratic-led states and advocates who argue the changes violate U.S laws, including obligations to asylum-seekers fleeing persecution.",
      "Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, who studies U.S. immigration policies at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and actions are likely contributing to migrants rethinking plans to cross the U.S. border.",
      "Putzel-Kavanaugh said it's \"one thing to be sent back to your home country if you have a fear, but to be sent to a high-security prison in El Salvador is an entirely different threat.\"",
      "Migration to the southern border, Putzel-Kavanaugh added, began dropping last year, after the Biden administration convinced Mexican officials to stop more U.S.-bound migrants. Unlawful border crossings dropped further after President Biden sharply restricted asylum through an executive order in June 2024.",
      "Putzel-Kavanaugh cautioned that migration patterns can change rapidly, noting that crossings appear to have plateaued since the massive plunge in Mr. Trump's first weeks in office. Still, the U.S.-Mexico border remains the quietest it has been in decades.",
      "Rolando Salinas, the Democratic mayor of Eagle Pass, Texas, said his border town was \"ground zero\" during the migration crisis faced by the Biden administration.

Small businesses do not have the margin or capital reserves to survive an increase in tariffs, Clark wrote in the letter.",

Still, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0said\u00a0in April it does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025.",
      "Clark added that tariffs could cause \"irreparable harm\" to the small business community if trade deals are not reached soon. Products from most countries are subject a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.",
      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs.

      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CBS News that Krebs is \"under active investigation by law enforcement agencies. That is a fact disqualifying him for Global Entry.\" CNN first reported that Krebs' Global Entry membership had been rescinded.",

A person may not be eligible for the Global Entry program if they are the subject of an ongoing federal, state or local law enforcement agency, according to CBP.",
      "Krebs was fired by Mr. Trump in 2020 after he refuted the president's unsupported claims that the election was rife was widespread voter fraud. CISA had released a joint statement days after the Nov. 3, 2020, election saying that it was the \"most secure in American history\" and that there was \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\"",
      "In announcing his decision to remove Krebs from his role as CISA director, Mr. Trump claimed the statement was \"highly inaccurate.\" While the president and his campaign mounted dozens of lawsuits challenging the integrity of the 2020 election, none were successful and claims of widespread fraud were refuted, including by Mr. Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has continued to claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him and has undertaken numerous actions to take revenge against his political adversaries and critics now that he is back in the White House. In addition to Krebs, the president has signed executive orders punishing major law firms that employed former special counsel Robert Mueller and members of his team, even though they no longer work there.",
      "He has also directed his administration to take away security clearances held by former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his opponents in the 2024 and 2016 elections, respectively, and Biden, as well as members of his administration.",
      "Like the memo targeting Krebs, Mr. Trump issued another punishing Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who authored a book and op-ed under a pseudonym that criticized the president during his first term as \"impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.\"",

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop new guidance for treating measles with drugs and vitamins, an HHS spokesperson said.",
      "The move comes as Kennedy has faced criticism during this year's record measles outbreaks for remarks misleading people into thinking that measles infections are easily curable and inflating myths about measles vaccines. Vaccination is the only way to prevent the highly infectious disease that can cause serious health complications or death in some cases.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities,\" the HHS spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The statement said the CDC effort would involve working with universities \"to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.\"",
      "While the CDC is continuing to recommend vaccination \"as the most effective way to prevent the disease,\" the statement says they recognize some Americans \"may choose not to vaccinate.\"",
      "\"Our commitment is to support all families \u2014 regardless of their vaccination status \u2014 in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles,\" the statement said.",
      "Kennedy hinted at the plans on Tuesday, telling reporters that there were \"many, many good ways to treat measles and doctors need to know that and to know those methods.\"",
      "\"We are developing now a worksheet for doctors to address the epidemic, to address people who have it, not just with vaccination, but actually with budesonide, with clarithromycin, with vitamin A and many, many other treatments that have been shown very effective,\" Kennedy said in Texas, according to a video published by local television station WFAA.",
      "The CDC did publish a fact sheet on Thursday for doctors treating measles, saying that other treatments \"such as antibiotics should be prescribed based on clinical judgement by an individual healthcare provider.\"",
      "Budesonide and clarithromycin",
      "For weeks, Kennedy has praised the use of the drugs budesonide and clarithromycin for treating measles, claiming \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" for some patients despite scant evidence for the recommendation.",
      "Anecdotal claims about success using the drugs stem from two Texas doctors \u2014 Dr. Ben Edwards and Dr. Richard Bartlett \u2014 whom Kennedy says he spoke with.",
      "Experts have criticized Edwards for his approach for treating children in the outbreak, including interacting with patients and their families while he was sick with the highly contagious virus. Bartlett previously was criticized for the unfounded claim that budesonide was a \"silver bullet\" for treating COVID-19.",
      "\"There is no cure for measles, and it can result in serious complications. It's misleading and dangerous to promote the idea that measles is easily treated using unproven and ineffective therapies like budesonide and clarithromycin,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP, said last month of the claim.",
      "Dr. James Campbell, vice chair of the AAP committee that develops recommendations for doctors treating measles and other infectious diseases, told CBS News earlier this year that the drugs can sometimes help hospitals treat severe complications of measles.",
      "While budesonide can help with lung inflammation and clarithromycin can fight off co-infections from other germs, Campbell cautioned that neither were antivirals for fighting the measles virus infection itself. He said decisions to use these drugs were best left up to doctors managing measles hospitalizations on an individual basis.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the U.S. because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" Campbell had said in an email.",
      "Vitamin A",
      "Kennedy's request for the CDC comes days after the agency stepped up its warning against overuse of vitamin A, which does not cure measles infections but can be useful for reducing the risk of severe illness. High levels of vitamin A can be toxic.",
      "\"Vitamin A does not prevent measles and is not a substitute for vaccination. Consistent with guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, vitamin A may be administered to infants and children in the United States with measles under the supervision of a healthcare provider as part of supportive management,\" the CDC said in updated guidance for doctors last month.",
      "The agency cautioned that giving too much vitamin A to children could lead to toxicity \"and cause damage to the liver, bones, central nervous system, and skin.\"",
      "A total of two doses of vitamin A are recommended for doctors to prescribe under the agency's guidance, at specific doses depending on the age of the patient.",
      "This is different from the unfounded approach touted by Kennedy to use cod liver oil to treat measles in children, which the AAP says can be dangerous.",
      "\"It has high amounts of vitamin A, much higher than the recommended daily amounts. It also can make kids sick if they take too much. In addition to vitamin A, cod liver oil is high in vitamin D \u2014 another nutrient that can be harmful if kids take more than the recommended daily amount,\" the association says.",

    "summary": "Starbucks plans to hire more baristas at thousands of stores starting in May as the coffee chain looks to improve customer service.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks is rethinking the role of \"innovation\" in running a coffee chain.",
      "After rolling out a new system of technical enhancements to streamline cold food and drink orders, the company made an abrupt U-turn this week and said it would halt use of its automated equipment and restore the human touch by bringing more baristas on board.",
      "The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that has lost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion.",
      "In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week.",
      "\"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said.",
      "What is the Siren system?",
      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",
      "Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers.",
      "\"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol \u2014 a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business \u2014 in as chief executive.",
      "In coming aboard in September, Niccol promised\u00a0to elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccol\u00a0said\u00a0during a call with analysts last year.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat.\"",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

      "Diabetes deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate data for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",

      "Ukrainian and U.S. officials have signed a joint economic investment deal that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earths minerals, the Treasury Department\u00a0announced Wednesday.",
      "A Treasury Department press release said the two countries have agreed to establish a \"United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund,\" referring to it as an \"economic partnership.\" The statement did not include more detail about the agreement.",
      "Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, confirmed that she signed the deal. In a series of posts on X written in Ukrainian, she described it as a 50/50 partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. She said the deal would be funded through direct investment, future U.S. aid and revenue from new mineral licensing deals \u2014 and does not set up any Ukrainian debt obligations.",
      "According to a Ukrainian fact sheet, the U.S. would contribute to the fund \"either through direct financial input or through new military assistance,\" and the agreement \"focuses on further, not past U.S. military assistance.\" Ukraine would contribute 50% of any royalties from future \u2014 but not existing \u2014 oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "Under the deal, Ukraine would hold onto ownership of its natural resources, and the fund can only be invested in resource and infrastructure projects within Ukraine. Profits from the fund would be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, and can be \"distributed between the partners\" after that, the fact sheet also said.",
      "An official at the Development Finance Corporation \u2014 a U.S. government agency helping to oversee the deal \u2014 said the joint fund will \"make strategic investments in critical minerals, hydrocarbons, natural resources, and natural resources-related infrastructure in Ukraine, which will help diversify and secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security.\"",
      "The fund will also \"select vital critical minerals to the United States for offtake,\" the official said.",
      "President Trump had\u00a0pressed\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about an economic deal that would include access to Ukraine's minerals, framing it as a way of paying the U.S. back for aiding the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia. Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's reserves of rare earth elements, which are used in electronics, defense technology and energy projects. Some of the country's reserves are located in parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in an interview with NewsNation late Wednesday. \"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have,\" Trump said, of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves.",
      "Zelenskyy initially traveled to Washington in February to sign a mineral deal with Mr. Trump. Those plans were\u00a0derailed\u00a0after an explosive Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance. During the meeting, Vance accused Zelenskyy of being\u00a0insufficiently grateful\u00a0for U.S. military aid.",
      "Negotiations continued despite the public acrimony. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting the U.S. was prepared to sign a deal, but Ukraine had requested \"last minute changes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has cast the mineral deal as a key part of his broader gambit to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.",
      "Those talks have proven rocky: At least twice in recent weeks, Trump administration officials have threatened to pull out of negotiations unless more progress is made. Mr. Trump has lashed out at Zelenskyy repeatedly, calling him a \"dictator\" earlier this year and accusing him last week of prolonging the war by refusing to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. The two leaders held a private meeting Saturday in the Vatican while attending the funeral of Pope Francis.",

      "Dar said Pakistan was committed to peace, but its \"armed forces are fully alert. Any misadventure will be met with a befitting and resolute response.\"",
      "The April 22 terrorist attack was claimed by a little known group that calls itself the Kashmir Resistance, but there has been no way to corroborate the claim made on social media.",
      "Just days after the tourists were killed in the popular vacation area, India took a number of non-military measures against Pakistan, calling off a key water sharing pact, downgrading diplomatic relations, and asking Pakistani nationals to leave the country. Pakistan announced similar, reciprocal measures a day later.",
      "Kashmir is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, but each nation has controlled its own portion of the mountainous region for decades. The two nations have fought three wars over the region, which is now divided by a de-facto border called the Line of Control (LoC).",

      "The scenic Himalayan region has been hit regularly by militant violence since an armed anti-Indian insurgency began in 1989. The simmering conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives over more than three decades.",
      "On Tuesday, the United Nations warned of potentially \"catastrophic\" consequences if the two nuclear-armed neighbors were to go to war.",

      "Level 3 advises Americans to reconsider traveling to the nation because of \"serious risks to safety and security.\" Level 4 is the highest advisory level indicating there is a \"greater likelihood of life-threatening risks.\" The department advises Americans to write a will and leave DNA samples if they decide to travel to a Level 4 nation in preparation for possible worst-case scenarios.",
      "Some nations could have multiple levels, with parts of the country more of a concern. For example, the advisory for Mexico, as of April 30, has specific levels for each state within the country, ranging from Level 1 to Level 4.",

    "summary": "The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and pressure from Trump, helped drive a massive boost in global military spending last year, a Swedish think tank says.",
    "story": [
      "Global military expenditure rose by 9.4% in 2024 to $2.7 trillion, the steepest yearly rise since the end of the Cold War, according to data compiled by the global security think tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Spending in Europe, including Russia, was a big factor behind the global surge in spending, SIPRI said.",
      "European nations' collective spending increased by 17% to $693 billion amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, the organization's data show.",
      "Russia's government increased its military spending by 38% to an estimated $149 billion last year, while Ukraine's grew by 2.9% to $64.7 billion. The Ukrainian spending amounted to 34% of the country's GDP, the largest military expenditure by percentage of GDP of any nation last year, according to SIPRI.",
      "\"Russia once again significantly increased its military spending, widening the spending gap with Ukraine,\" said Diego Lopes da Silva, a senior researcher at SIPRI. \"Ukraine currently allocates all of its tax revenues to its military. In such a tight fiscal space, it will be challenging for Ukraine to keep increasing its military spending.\"",
      "All NATO member nations increased their military spending, too, with 18 countries spending at least 2% of their GDP during 2024, which SIPRI said was the highest number of NATO members to hit that threshold since the alliance adopted it as a spending guideline in 2014.",
      "\"The rapid spending increases among European NATO members were driven mainly by the ongoing Russian threat and concerns about possible U.S. disengagement within the alliance,\" said Jade Guiberteau Ricard, another SIPRI researcher. \"It is worth saying that boosting spending alone will not necessarily translate into significantly greater military capability or independence from the USA. Those are far more complex tasks.\"",
      "In the Middle East, Israel and Lebanon significantly increased their military spending. Israel boosted its defense investment by 65% to $46.5 billion, while Lebanon increased its own by 58%, to $635 million.",
      "\"Despite widespread expectations that many Middle Eastern countries would increase their military spending in 2024, major rises were limited to Israel and Lebanon,\" said SIPRI researcher Zubaida Karim. \"Elsewhere [in the region], countries either did not significantly increase spending in response to the war in Gaza or were prevented from doing so by economic constraints.\"",

      "\"They argue, primarily, that the preconditions required to apply the AEA do not exist, that the intended application of the Proclamation and the AEA violate the designated alien enemies\u2019 due process rights under the Constitution, and that the procedures that Respondents seek to follow violate the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Convention Against Torture.",

      "\"Neither the Court nor the parties question that the Executive Branch can direct the detention and removal of aliens who engage in criminal activity in the United States,\" Rodriguez, nominated by Trump in 2018, wrote. \"The President\u2019s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute\u2019s terms.",

The judge later broadened his ruling to protect all Venezuelans detained in his judicial district, which includes the cities of Houston, Galveston, Laredo, McAllen, Brownsville, Corpus Christi and Victoria, from deportation.",

      "\"The Proclamation makes no reference to and in no manner suggests that a threat exists of an organized, armed group of individuals entering the United States at the direction of Venezuela to conquer the country or assume control over a portion of the nation,\" Rodriguez wrote. \"Thus, the Proclamation\u2019s language cannot be read as describing conduct that falls within the meaning of \u2018invasion\u2019 for purposes of the AEA.\"",
      "The judge also noted that the provision has only been used during the two World Wars and the War of 1812.",

      "After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If you\u2019ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",

      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",
      "A man working on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

      "Kurt Knutsson talks about a soft, vine-like robot called SPROUT that aids safe survivor rescues in collapsed buildings.",
      "When disaster strikes and buildings collapse, every second counts for emergency responders searching for survivors trapped beneath rubble. Traditional tools often fall short in these dangerous, chaotic environments, but a new breed of robot, SPROUT, is poised to make a life-saving difference.",

      "Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is SPROUT?",
      "SPROUT, short for Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit, is a flexible, vine-like robot developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. Unlike rigid robots or static cameras, SPROUT can \"grow\" into tight, winding spaces that are otherwise inaccessible, giving first responders a new way to explore, map and assess collapsed structures.",

      "ELECTRIC SUV IS THE ULTIMATE LIFELINE FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS",
      "How does SPROUT work?",
      "SPROUT is made of an airtight fabric tube that inflates with air, allowing it to extend from a fixed base. As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",
      "Three pouch motors along the vine\u2019s length enable SPROUT to bend and turn, while an internal reel system allows the robot to be compactly stored and precisely deployed as needed. In addition to cameras, SPROUT can carry other sensors to image, map and even assess hazards within the collapsed structure.",

      "Why traditional tools fall short",
      "Traditional search-and-rescue gear, such as rigid robots or specialized cameras, struggles in disaster zones for several reasons. Cameras can only probe straight paths, often requiring teams to cut new access holes to see further into the rubble.",
      "Rigid robots are prone to damage in unstable, cramped environments and are expensive to repair. Manual probing is time-consuming and physically exhausting for responders.",
      "SPROUT\u2019s soft, flexible design directly addresses these challenges, offering a safer, faster and more adaptable solution for navigating the unpredictable landscape of collapsed buildings.",

    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Healthcare institutions and insurers arguably collect the most sensitive information about you, including IDs, contact details, addresses and medical records. But they often don\u2019t put in the same level of effort to protect that data.",
      "That\u2019s clear from the growing number of healthcare data breaches we\u2019ve seen recently. In most of those cases, a bad actor was involved.",
      "But in the latest news, health insurance giant Blue Shield of California confirmed that it had been sharing private health data of 4.7 million users with Google for three years without even realizing it.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "A person doing a Google search\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson))",
      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",
      "A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach:",
      "\"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\"",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Impact on patients and the industry",
      "Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",
      "Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings.",

      "The Blue Shield of California incident is a reminder that even well-known healthcare providers can mishandle sensitive data. While you can\u2019t always control what happens behind the scenes, there\u00a0are steps you can take to reduce your exposure and safeguard your privacy:",
      "1. Limit what you share on health portals:\u00a0Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible.",
      "2. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0Browsers like Brave or Firefox offer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity.",
      "3. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Visit\u00a0Google\u2019s Ad Settings and disable ad personalization. This won\u2019t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting.",
      "4. Opt out of tracking where possible:\u00a0Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it.",
      "5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):\u00a0Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that\u2019s a cue to proceed cautiously.",
      "6. Monitor your accounts and credit:\u00a0Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach.",
      "7. Ask questions:\u00a0Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards.",

      "Bonus privacy steps (For extra peace of mind)",
      "If you want to go beyond the basics, here are some additional steps that can help reduce your digital footprint and catch misuse early:",
      "Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you\u2019re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one. We need accountability in data practices, especially when human error or tech oversight can cause damage at scale.",

      "The CyberGuy shows you how to strengthen your passwords on your Google account.",
      "The RockYou2024 leak, which exposed almost 10 billion passwords in July of last year, might seem like old news, but its impact is still felt today.",
      "It's considered the largest password compilation ever released.\u00a0With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high. For anyone still reusing passwords, the dangers are real \u2014 and growing.",
      "That's why password security has never been more critical, and the big question remains, how secure is my password?",

      "Username and password on tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why does password strength matter?",
      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

      "Password strength test: 7-point self-evaluation checklist",
      "How secure is your password, really? It\u2019s time to put it to the test. Grab a pen (or just keep a mental tally) and score yourself based on this 7-point password strength test.\u00a0Each \"yes\" earns you a point.\u00a0So, let\u2019s see how your password holds up in today\u2019s threat landscape.",
      "Length is your first line of defense. Short passwords \u2014 think six or eight characters \u2014 can be cracked in minutes by modern hacking tools. At 12 characters or more, you\u2019re making it exponentially harder for attacks to succeed.",
      "Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters strengthens your password by increasing complexity. For example, instead of using something like \"t8g5k9w2,\" use \"T8g5K9w2\" \u2014 same characters, just more variety. Mix it up.",
      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",
      "Even good passwords can go stale. It\u2019s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.",
      "Illustration of password login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGEROUS CHROME EXTENSIONS MIMIC PASSWORD MANAGERS",
      "How did you score?",
      "Now, let\u2019s take a look at your score:",
      "0-2 points: Uh-oh. Your passwords are waving a welcome flag to hackers. Time for a serious upgrade.3-4 points: Not terrible, but you\u2019re still vulnerable. Patch those weak spots pronto.5-6 points: Solid effort! You\u2019re close to fortress-level security \u2014 tweak a bit more.7 points: Nailed it.

      "7 points: Nailed it. Your password is strong and secure \u2014 just remember to keep it updated.",
      "This quick password strength test isn\u2019t just a quiz, it\u2019s a good reminder. Even one weak spot could be all it takes for someone to break in. In a world full of data leaks, a strong, unique password is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself. So, what\u2019s your score? Think it\u2019s time to level up?",
      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "With data breaches becoming increasingly common, it's clear that password security isn't a \"set it and forget it\" task. It's an ongoing process.

      "The idea floated was that Biden would give a speech directly to the Israeli public, presenting two options, according to his Middle East advisor Ilan Goldenberg. \"A lot of people were talking about, including in the Oval Office at times, the idea of, like, the President going out and giving a speech.

Your sons and daughters are going to keep fighting. Most of the hostages are going to come home dead.

That's what people were saying, like, \u2018let's just break this up because it's not going anywhere good.\u2019\"",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s promise to carry out the biggest deportation campaign in American history has a distinct and potent hallmark: speed. Officials have fast-tracked deportation proceedings so that some people are removed without speaking to an attorney, family members or without a court hearing at all.",
      "Trump\u2019s immigration efforts have broken norms and bent the law as he enacts his agenda with dizzying fervor, seeking to show his supporters he\u2019s delivering, even as the overall number of deportations in February lagged behind Biden administration during the same period last year.",
      "\u201cOne theme that runs through all the Trump administration\u2019s immigration actions this term is its attempt to rush people out of the country without due process or oversight by the courts,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, who has argued some of the most high-profile immigration-related challenges to Trump during both terms.",
      "Trump\u2019s first-term push to drastically reshape the nation\u2019s immigration system was often stymied by the courts, slowed because of the officials around him\u00a0or undone over a tide of public criticism.

      "The minimal requirement for due process, as defined by judges over time, \u201cis that you know what you are being charged for, you have the ability to present the case against the charge, and you have the right to have a lawyer to that,\u201d he said.",

      "Homan said those with criminal records remain the priority, but anyone in the U.S. illegally should consider themselves a target. But some of these recent cases have involved undocumented immigrants arrested during a routine check-in with immigration officials, a significant escalation of the deportation efforts.",
      "According to the Department of Homeland Security, immigration officers had arrested 151,000 undocumented immigrants, far more than the Biden administration did during the same period last year.",
      "But overall deportations are\u00a0lagging behind those of the Biden administration during the same period last year.",

      "And unlike his first term, when after widespread condemnation, Trump backed off the \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d that separated families who crossed the border to seek asylum, there has been no backing down, even as some efforts draw criticism.",
      "The administration has revoked more than 300 student visas; college students have been picked up, in some cases by masked immigration agents, and held in detention centers, sometimes a thousand miles from their homes with little warning and often with few details about why they were being detained.",
      "And last week in Louisiana, three U.S. citizen children from two families were removed from the country with their mothers amid public outcry. One of them is a 4-year-old with stage 4 cancer who was being treated in the U.S.",
      "Homan said Monday that officials sent the children because the mothers requested they depart with them. \u201cThis was a parental decision. Parenting 101. The mothers made that choice,\u201d he said.",
      "Yet, Sirine Shebaya, the executive director of the National Immigration Project, which has been helping on the cases, insisted the mothers did not choose to have their children removed from the U.S. and that they were given no other alternatives.\u00a0She said they were not told that \u201cthere were people on the outside saying they were ready to take their kids with them.\u201d",
      "One of the women who was flown out with her 2-year-old U.S. citizen daughter is pregnant. Attorneys said she had a less than two-minute phone call with her husband that Immigration and Customs Enforcement abruptly cut off, so she could not\u00a0arrange for her child to stay in the U.S.  She had been in the country a number of years and checking in with ICE regularly, Shebaya said.",
      "The second was deported with her 4-year-old son who has stage 4 cancer and her daughter, 7, both citizens. \u00a0Attorneys said the boy was sent out without access to his medications and treatment. The woman's attorney said she did not sign or write anything or give consent to her children being removed from the country with her. He said she wasn\u2019t given a phone to call her attorney or family.",
      "Shebaya said normally, there\u2019s\u00a0time for people who are ordered to be deported to make a case to stay, and it\u2019s highly unusual when children are involved not to make time for decisions to be made about the children.",
      "But both women had been ordered\u00a0to be deported\u00a0 after they failed to show for immigration appointments, making them targets for a faster deportation.",
      "The mother with the 2-year-old missed her appointment because she had been kidnapped while waiting in Mexico, said Mich P. Gonz\u00e1lez, co-founder of Sanctuary of the South, an immigration and LGBTQ civil rights cooperative, who represents her. She was eventually released. The second woman, who had been an unaccompanied minor at 13 and claimed asylum at the border, didn\u2019t receive the notice for a hearing, Gonz\u00e1lez said.",
      "The administration is\u00a0also ramping up its calls for undocumented immigrants to leave voluntarily \u2014 or risk being permanently barred from the country if immigration authorities find them first.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the administration has given parents in the U.S. illegally the opportunity \u201cto take control of their departure process with the potential ability to return the legal, right way and come back to live the American dream.\u201d",
      "Linda Rivas, an immigration lawyer in El Paso, Texas, summed up the second-term agenda this way: \u201cLaw feels like a suggestion. Families and communities are terrified of what\u2019s to come.\u201d"

      "Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said that Combs\u2019 legal team discussed the offer with him and that together they decided to reject it. Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said the proposal would have given Combs a lighter sentence than he would receive if he is found guilty at trial on all charges.",
      "The hearing was the last before the trial begins with jury selection Monday. Subramanian said voir dire, or the questioning of potential jurors, would be conducted in a way to protect jurors\u2019 privacy, including possible disclosures about experiences with sexual or domestic abuse.",

      "Comey said she understood the defense team had added two new attorneys and said prosecutors would like to know who they are. Agnifilo said that the new attorneys were in the courtroom, and that they would file their appearances by the end of the day. One of them is Xavier Donaldson, who has been present for several previous hearings.",
      "A prosecutor said at a hearing last week that Combs had been offered a plea deal, the details of which have not been made public.",
      "Subramanian asked all parties to be in his courtroom at 8 a.m. Monday and reminded them to avoid making public statements that could prejudice the trial\u2019s outcome.",
      "The reminder came in response to a court filing this week, in which Combs\u2019 attorneys asked Subramanian to bar lawyers for witnesses, including Douglas Wigdor and Lisa Bloom, who represent people who have filed separate civil suits against Combs, from speaking publicly about the trial until its conclusion.",
      "Combs attorney Teny Geragos said at Thursday\u2019s hearing that Bloom had appeared on the BBC to try to bolster her client\u2019s credibility.",

      "\u201cHow hypocritical that Mr. Combs and his attorneys, having made public statements many times, now want to silence me,\u201d Bloom said Thursday. \u201cAccusers and their attorneys have every right to speak out. I am very proud to represent my brave clients, Dawn Richard and John Doe, in litigation against Mr. Combs.",
      "\u201cI look forward to attending Mr. Combs\u2019 upcoming criminal trial in New York and continuing to advocate for my clients consistent with the law and the ethical rules.\u201d",
      "Richard alleged in a suit filed last year, a week before Combs was arrested, that he had groped and threatened her and that she had witnessed him assaulting his former longtime girlfriend Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura. Richards\u2019 suit is pending, along with dozens of others filed by men and women accusing Combs of sexual misconduct, which Combs has vehemently denied.",
      "Wigdor represents Ventura,\u00a0whose bombshell lawsuit filed in November 2023 preceded the federal raids of his home in March 2024 and criminal charges. Ventura accused Combs of years of physical and emotional abuse and alleged that he forced her to have sex with male sex workers \u2014 encounters she said he called \u201cfreak offs\u201d that were fueled by drugs and alcohol \u2014 while he masturbated and recorded them. Freak offs are at the center of the government\u2019s case.",
      "Ventura and Combs settled the lawsuit within a day without disclosing the terms and with Combs denying any wrongdoing.",
      "Wigdor pledged to fight Combs\u2019 efforts to prevent him from speaking publicly about the case.",
      "\u201cWe will vigorously oppose the motion seeking an extraordinary sweeping gag order as it is an obvious attempt at controlling and silencing victims and their counsel in contravention of well-established legal and ethical precedent,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cGiven this, it should come as no surprise that Combs fails to cite even one case to support his request.\u201d",
      "Combs is alleged in the five-count indictment to have coerced and threatened women to participate in sexual acts and silenced them through blackmail and violence. Prosecutors allege he had help from a network of associates and employees."

    "summary": "The anticipated rollout of updated Covid vaccines this fall might be at risk after a change by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "The anticipated rollout of updated Covid vaccines this fall might be at risk after a change by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in how vaccines are tested, experts say.",
      "Under the change by Kennedy, according to an HHS spokesperson, all new vaccines will need to go through placebo-controlled clinical trials \u2014 where some people get the actual shot and others get something inactive, like a saline shot \u2014 to compare the results.",
      "Running trials that include a placebo group is already routine for most new vaccines.",
      "The original Covid vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, approved in late 2020, went through placebo-controlled trials. But as the virus continued to mutate and the vaccines needed to be updated to match the circulating strain, drugmakers moved to a flu vaccine-like model \u2014 using smaller studies to test how well the updated shots triggered an immune response against the variant in question.",
      "Like the annual flu shot, the updated Covid vaccines weren\u2019t treated as entirely new products, since they still used the same formula, with just a tweak to what strain the vaccine would be targeting. The mRNA Covid vaccines were designed so that this change would be particularly easy to make, in the event the shots needed to be quickly updated.",
      "Quickly, in this case, turns out to be several months. In order to have enough Covid doses ready to go for the fall, vaccine-makers are told what strain to target in the spring.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee is expected to meet in May or June to make a recommendation on which strains should be included in the next round of shots. A person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the FDA had planned to schedule a meeting for May 22. An HHS spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting date.",
      "If the FDA deems Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s updated vaccines \u201cnew\u201d products, requiring fresh trials, it\u2019s extremely unlikely the doses would be ready for the fall, experts said.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, said the change would almost certainly delay the rollout of the updated shots from Pfizer and Moderna by \u201cmonths,\u201d as it would take time for the drugmakers to design the new trials and enroll participants.",
      "That would only be the start \u2014 the drugmakers would then have to run the actual trial, which would take several months on its own, at minimum, and analyze the results.",
      "Even the Covid vaccines \u2014 which were hailed as \u201cthe most successful government science program\u201d because of how quickly they were developed, according to Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at UW Medicine in Seattle \u2014 still took at least about six months to run their Phase 3 trials.",
      "The HHS spokesperson didn\u2019t directly respond to a question about whether the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would require new clinical trials.",
      "However, the spokesperson said in a statement that \u201cFDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has indicated that significant updates to existing vaccines \u2014 such as those addressing seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift \u2014 may be considered \u2018new products\u2019 requiring additional clinical evaluation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, trials from four years ago conducted in people without natural immunity no longer suffice,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cA four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data,\u201d they said, adding that the flu shot would be exempt from the new rule, because it \u201chas been tried and tested for more than 80 years.\u201d",
      "The FDA has already delayed the approval of Novavax\u2019s updated Covid vaccine, requiring the company to carry out a new clinical trial because the strain included in the shot differs from what was originally authorized.",
      "Vaccine experts panned the new requirements.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cunethical,\u201d Offit said, noting that it\u2019s generally frowned upon in the scientific community to give someone a placebo when an approved product already exists that can protect them.",
      "Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a pediatrician who played a key role in developing the rubella vaccine, said the move would make \u201cno sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat would be reasonable is to compare the old vaccine with the new vaccine to see whether the new vaccine gives better immunologic responses,\u201d Plotkin said. \u201cWe have vaccines against Covid, where we have pretty concrete ideas as to what works and what doesn\u2019t work. We know they\u2019re not perfect, but we have vaccines we know work.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Former government officials have said HHS, under Kennedy, was moving to slow-walk vaccine approvals, including by imposing new regulatory hurdles on drugmakers, such as changing the requirements for approval or seeking additional clinical trial data.",
      "Vaccine experts also fear the rule change is part of a broader effort by Kennedy to sow distrust in vaccines and limit public access to them.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to make vaccines more onerous to make, more onerous to test by bringing up these sort of false safety concerns or false efficacy concerns,\u201d Offit said.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the change is unlikely to affect brand-new vaccines. But it could have major implications for vaccines that may require updates besides Covid \u2014 like those for RSV \u2014 since placebo trials are costly and take significantly more time to conduct.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not feasible, and would lead to lots of hospitalizations and deaths,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Plotkin added that vaccines being developed for infections that are incurable, like HIV, may also be at risk.",
      "\u201cSuppose you wanted to develop a new HIV vaccine?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould you do a placebo-controlled trial in that situation? I mean exposing children to a disease which is very serious without offering them anything.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A veteran activist of the Civil Rights Movement said he was notified by the Smithsonian Institution that items he loaned to the National Museum of African American History and Culture may be returned, amid a potential review of the museum\u2019s collections ordered by President Donald Trump.",
      "Rev. Amos C. Brown, pastor of Third Baptist Church in San Francisco, loaned two books to the Smithsonian, which have been displayed since the museum opened nearly a decade ago. One of his items is an edition of \u201cThe History of the Negro Race in America\u201d by George Washington Williams, which was written in 1880 and is among the first books to document Black American history and racism in the U.S. The other is a Bible that Brown carried during protests alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "The reasons given for the items\u2019 return initially raised alarms that the Trump administration had begun to make visible changes to a museum considered to be a crown jewel of Black American culture.",
      "Recent reports that the museum has already removed exhibits documenting the civil rights struggle are false, the Smithsonian said. The White House had no comment for this story.",
      "However, the threat of changes to the African American museum has prompted strong responses from Democratic lawmakers, historians, civil rights leaders and education advocates, many of whom planned to demonstrate in support of the museum in the nation\u2019s capital Saturday.",
      "Brown, who counts former Vice President Kamala Harris among his parishioners, received an email last month from a Smithsonian official telling him that his items would be returned over concerns about their preservation due to museum lighting. Brown told The Associated Press he found the claim \u201ca flimsy excuse for a museum.\u201d",
      "After the initial email to Brown, a different Smithsonian official reached out to him to express regret that the initial reason had caused a \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d Brown said. Instead, according to Brown, the official said Smithsonian archivists will defer to \u201ca panel that will reconsider whether or not my artifacts should be there.\u201d He said he was told this would be done for a wide range of historical artifacts.",
      "Smithsonian officials did not respond to questions about whether such a panel has been formed.",
      "After that interaction, Brown said a third Smithsonian official later reached out to him and scheduled a video conference meeting for Friday afternoon. He said he was not given the names of who would join the call, but was told it would include senior Smithsonian leadership.",
      "The Smithsonian \u201croutinely returns loaned artifacts per applicable loan agreements and rotates objects on display in accordance with the Smithsonian\u2019s high standards of care and preservation and as part of our regular museum turnover,\u201d according to a statement the institution sent to the AP.",
      "\u201cRecent claims that objects have been removed for reasons other than adherence to standard loan agreements or museum practices are false,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "Language of Trump\u2019s executive order raised alarm",
      "Concerns over potential reforms at the Smithsonian have arisen since Trump signed a March 27 executive order titled \u201cRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History.\u201d The order argued that the Smithsonian had in recent years \u201ccome under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology\u201d and said the institution has \u201cpromoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\u201d",
      "The order designated Vice President JD Vance and Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide, \u201cto remove improper ideology\u201d from Smithsonian properties, which include 21 museums and the National Zoo. The Smithsonian encompasses educational, research and archival centers meant to increase and spread knowledge. It manages more than 150 million artifacts.",
      "The order cites several national parks and Smithsonian museums as displaying potentially objectionable content, including the African American museum.",
      "The Smithsonian is governed by a Board of Regents that is chaired by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and includes Vance, members of Congress from both parties and major business executives and philanthropists. The board\u2019s next meeting is scheduled for June 9.",
      "Lawmakers, academics and activists fear the order could eventually influence the Smithsonian to remove artifacts, exhibits or research that do not conform to the Trump administration\u2019s understanding of history.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sent a letter to Roberts warning that the order \u201cseeks to whitewash our history\u201d and \u201cis cowardly and unpatriotic.\u201d He compared the proclamation to efforts in \u201ctwentieth-century regimes like those in the Soviet Union and 1930s Germany.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t need African American history exhibits if America hadn\u2019t been founded by excluding African Americans and distorting our image,\u201d said Rep. Jonathan Jackson, whose father is Rev. Jesse Jackson, the politician and civil rights activist. The Jackson family is documented in multiple Smithsonian museums and said they have not been notified of changes to those exhibits.",
      "\u201cSo this makes American history whole, and I think (Trump) should go and visit it before he attempts to erase and delete and distort that tradition,\u201d said the Illinois Democrat. Trump visited the African American museum in 2017. After the tour, he wrote on social media that the museum was \u201cA great job done by amazing people!\u201d",
      "Protests follow weeks of questions about the Smithsonian\u2019s future",
      "Civil rights leaders have organized in the wake of Trump\u2019s order. A coalition of more than three dozen groups on Monday launched a \u201cFreedom to Learn\u201d campaign that will include a May 3 rally and march at the Smithsonian\u2019s African American museum.",
      "Among the partnering organizations are the NAACP, National Urban League, National Coalition for Black Civic Participation, Black Voters Matter, Movement for Black Lives, National Council of Negro Women and the Leadership Coalition for Civil Rights.",
      "Predominantly Black churches have rallied to support the museum and staged protests and called for greater support for the museum in the wake of potential changes.",
      "The National Museum of African American History and Culture opened to the public in 2016. It contains more than 40,000 artifacts documenting more than 400 years of African American history. The museum\u2019s exhibits span topics including the everyday life and culture of African Americans and the community\u2019s contributions to broader American culture, business, sports, religion and politics, as well as the impact of slavery, segregation and discrimination on the nation\u2019s history.",
      "Brown, 84, said he\u2019d previously had a \u201cpositive relationship\u201d with the Smithsonian over the items he had donated to the museum. As a youth activist in the civil rights movement, Brown organized alongside icons like King, activist Medgar Evers and congressman John Lewis. He criticized the institution for \u201coperating in secrecy\u201d about the changes at the African American museum.",
      "\u201cBehave. Be respectful. Speak truth to those who sit in seats of power,\u201d Brown said of the proper response to any changes at the museum. \u201cLet\u2019s be kind and just. If we don\u2019t, Dr. King was right \u2014 Martin was right \u2014 that if we don\u2019t learn to live together, brothers and sisters, we\u2019re all going to perish as fools.\u201d",

      "Australia\u2019s vulnerability was on display in February when the Chinese military conducted live-fire drills off the country\u2019s coast, forcing dozens of commercial flights to reroute.",
      "That\u2019s why Australian politicians on both sides of the aisle say they remain committed to AUKUS, the security pact among Australia, the U.S. and Britain, even as Australians question whether they can still rely on the U.S. for their defense.",

      "Under AUKUS, Australia is set to buy several nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. as a deterrent against China.",
      "But Australia would struggle to pay for those submarines without its trade relationship with China, said James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\u201cThis is a big cost problem for a small economy like Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t go all in on AUKUS, all in on the United States, all in on containing China and imagine that our trade with China, which is paying for our submarines, can actually be sustained. It can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Both Albanese and Dutton have downplayed any uncertainty around U.S. relations, but Laurenceson believes cracks are emerging in bipartisan support for the alliance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll say that our security alliance with the U.S. is much more than just about one administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true, but Trump is certainly challenging that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 State prosecutors in Thailand said Thursday that they don\u2019t intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.",
      "The arrest last month of Paul Chambers, a political science lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, had drawn concern from the academic community, especially from Asian studies scholars around the world, as well as the U.S. government.",
      "The decision not to prosecute Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native, does not immediately clear him of the charge of insulting the monarchy \u2014 also known as \u201cl\u00e8se majest\u00e9\u201d \u2014 or a related charge of violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activities.",
      "The announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.",
      "Chambers, who has a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, was arrested in early April on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command.",
      "He has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.",
      "Chambers\u2019 supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, was not written by him.",
      "He had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.",
      "Chambers\u2019 visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. It was not immediately clear whether the revocation will stand.",
      "\u201cThis case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\u201d the U.S. State Department said after Chambers\u2019 arrest. \u201cWe continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\u201d",
      "Thailand\u2019s l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law calls for three to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.",
      "That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the law."

      "Looking through binoculars, program manager Sarah Callan scanned the shoreline for a growing problem on Block Island \u2014 entangled seals.",
      "When fishing gear, garbage or a balloon gets wrapped around a gray seal\u2019s neck, it tightens as the marine mammal \u2014 which can exceed 800 pounds \u2014 grows and lead to significant injury or death.",
      "Twenty entangled gray seals have been reported to the Connecticut-based nonprofit organization so far this year; that is more than what it typically documents in a full year.",
      "Callan called the spike \u201calarming.\u201d",
      "NBC News was given rare access to follow Mystic, working in partnership with the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society and the Block Island Maritime Institute, as they set out to disentangle seals born in the last several months.",
      "Callan and her colleagues flanked a group of seal pups sunbathing on the water\u2019s edge. They army-crawled in an attempt not to spook the herd before they sprinted in with bright red boards to separate the entangled pup and scoop him up with a net in a feat of speed and impeccable timing.",
      "Once the pup was contained, the team drew blood, attached a tracker for research and cut him free of the fishing net constricting his neck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to just release the seal today and avoid having to bring it into our clinic for rehab,\u201d Callan said as the team worked. \u201cThe quicker we can get out here to disentangle them, the better.\u201d",
      "This is the same team that took in a\u00a0wayward seal\u00a0stranded in downtown New Haven, Connecticut, in February. The seal pup won over the internet with his big eyes and sweet cry, and the public even voted on his name, \u201cChappy.\u201d",

      "The Department of Health and Human Services released a review on Thursday that found that the quality of evidence regarding the effects of transition-related care for minors \u201cis very low,\u201d and that, as a result, many U.S. doctors have managed to unintentionally \u201cfail their patients\u201d by providing them with such care.",
      "\u201cA central theme of this Review is that many U.S. medical professionals and associations have fallen short of their duty to prioritize the health interests of young patients,\u201d the conclusion of the 409-page report states.",
      "The HHS review found that there is limited evidence regarding the effects of medical interventions for youth with gender dysphoria on \u201cpsychological outcomes, quality of life, regret, or long-term health.\u201d At the same time, it found that \u201cevidence for harms associated with pediatric medical transition in systematic reviews\u201d is \u201csparse,\u201d but said \u201cthis finding should be interpreted with caution\u201d because there are no studies that track and report harms.",
      "It also sharply criticized the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, an international nonprofit made up of medical professionals that develops guidance regarding trans health care, arguing that its guidelines are biased and politically motivated. The HHS report alleges that WPATH has influenced U.S. medical associations to create a false perception that there is consensus regarding transition care for minors despite concerns from whistleblowers and detransitioners, or the relatively small number of people who no longer identify as trans or regret transition care they received.",
      "The review also casts doubt on the increasing number of studies in recent years that have found a significant independent association between gender dysphoria and suicide, and on studies that have linked access to transition care to improved mental health outcomes for youth.",
      "The HHS review ultimately calls for psychotherapy as \u201ca noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria\u201d and for more research regarding the effects of exploratory psychotherapy on minors with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report marks the most recent escalation of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back access to transition-related care and other rights for trans people. President Donald Trump issued several executive orders targeting trans people during his first weeks in office, including one declaring there are only two unchangeable sexes assigned at birth, another banning trans people from serving or enlisting in the military and one prohibiting federal funding for hospitals that provide transition care to minors.",
      "The order regarding trans care for minors, signed on Jan. 28,\u00a0required HHS to publish a review of the existing literature on \u201cbest practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria,\u201d the medical term for the distress caused by the misalignment between someone\u2019s birth sex and gender identity. The HHS review notes that it is \u201cnot a clinical practice guideline,\u201d which is meant to help clinicians and patients make decisions about care, \u201cand it does not issue legislative or policy recommendations.\u201d However, the review could still affect access to transition care for minors nationwide by adding fuel to the political firestorm surrounding it.",
      "The review\u2019s findings mark a significant break between the federal government and the stance of major U.S. medical associations \u2014 including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association \u2014\u00a0which support access to transition-related care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "As a result, the review was met with immediate backlash from medical associations and trans activists, who criticized its methods and lack of transparency. Most notably, HHS did not list any of the review\u2019s authors in what appears to be a break with protocol, as the names of authors are generally required to be included on any scientific publication.",
      "\u201cWhile this is a systematic review of the literature on this subject executed by experts in the field, the credibility of this report plummets in the mind of many folks in the scientific and medical communities because those experts are not named anywhere,\u201d said Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, a clinical professor of pediatrics at Stanford University\u2019s medical school.",
      "She added that a scientific report of this kind generally also lists the names of the experts who peer-reviewed it, and this review does not.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the entire report was peer-reviewed or only a portion of it. A news release issued by HHS on Thursday states: \u201cChapters of this review were subject to peer review prior to this publication, and a post-publication peer review will begin in the coming days involving stakeholders with different perspectives.\u201d",
      "Ladinsky said that is highly out of the ordinary, and that post-publication peer review generally only happens when there has been \u201cserious doubt cast\u201d on the findings of a study or report.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, said the department \"stands firm in its decision to withhold the names of the contributors to this report in order to protect them from intimidation tactics and undue pressure campaigns.\"",
      "He added, \"These tactics aim to stifle thoughtful, evidence-based analysis, preventing contributors from making independent judgments and engaging in honest peer reviews.\"",
      "He said the contributors' names will be shared after the post-publication peer review is conducted.",
      "Susan J. Kressly, the president, American Academy of Pediatrics, said the organization is \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d by the report.",
      "\u201cFor such an analysis to carry credibility, it must consider the totality of available data and the full spectrum of clinical outcomes rather than relying on select perspectives and a narrow set of data,\u201d Kressly said in a statement. \u201cThis report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.\u201d",
      "The review also promotes \u201cexploratory psychotherapy,\u201d which refers to talk therapy as an alternative treatment to puberty blockers or hormone therapy. In this kind of therapy, therapists try to help youth \u201ccome to terms with their bodies,\u201d according to the review, or accept their birth sex.",
      "Some of the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy organizations \u2014 including GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization, and The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization \u2014 as well as medical experts who specialize in research regarding care for LGBTQ youth said \u201cexploratory psychotherapy\u201d is often another way of referring to \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d or a discredited practice that attempts to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "\u201cThis is the argument they have been using for decades, and really it\u2019s conversion therapy light,\u201d said Doug Haldeman, a psychologist and professor of clinical psychology at John F. Kennedy University. \u201cWe are in an era where the administration has made it clear from the very first day that their wish is to erase trans identity altogether.\u201d",
      "Haldeman, who is also the author of \u201cThe Case Against Conversion \u2018Therapy\u2019: Evidence, Ethics, and Alternatives,\u201d said there is years of research showing that trying to get trans people to \u201caccept\u201d their birth sex has negative mental health outcomes.",
      "The HHS review pushes back on equating \u201cexploratory\u201d therapy with so-called conversion therapy, arguing that all psychotherapy is \u201cexploratory by definition.\u201d",
      "The review also mentions multiple \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d or people who previously helped provide care to trans youth who have since denounced such care. It mentions Jamie Reed, a former case worker at the Transgender Center at the St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital, who alleged in a 23-page affidavit that children were being routinely prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy without \u201cappropriate or accurate\u201d mental health assessments. Her allegations were used by state lawmakers in support of legislation that eventually barred gender-affirming care for minors in the state of Missouri.",
      "The review says that the concerns of whistleblowers have been \u201cdiscounted, dismissed, or ignored by prominent advocates and practitioners of pediatric medical transition.\u201d",
      "Reed said that, \u201cas a named whistleblower in the report, and as a lesbian myself with insider knowledge of this field, I wholeheartedly agree with the conclusions\u201d of the review.",
      "\u201cGender medicine has been gay conversion therapy since the beginning,\u201d Reed said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThe HHS review shares that history and concludes the practice raises \u2018serious justice-related concerns\u2019 because of the overrepresentation of LGB youth among patients. As a lifelong Democrat, I believe it is high time for bipartisan support to acknowledge the findings of this report.\u201d",
      "Ladinsky previously practiced as a pediatrician in Birmingham, Alabama, for 10 years, where she treated hundreds of trans adolescents until the state passed a ban on transition care for minors in 2022. The state is one of 25 that have enacted such restrictions.",
      "\u201cAll of us on the front lines will tell you that in these 25 states where elements of the care is banned, we have yet to learn of one young person who is no longer transgender,\u201d Ladinsky said."

      "He has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said that Combs\u2019 legal team discussed the offer with him and that together they decided to reject it. Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said the proposal would have given Combs a lighter sentence than he would receive if he is found guilty at trial on all charges.",
      "The hearing was the last before the trial begins with jury selection Monday. Subramanian said voir dire, or the questioning of potential jurors, would be conducted in a way to protect jurors\u2019 privacy, including possible disclosures about experiences with sexual or domestic abuse.",
      "Subramanian said he wanted to seat a jury of 12 and six alternates in three days.",
      "The court will call 50 jurors each day to the 26th-floor courtroom in Manhattan. Each juror will either be excused for cause or asked to return to the main courtroom for further questioning.",
      "The goal is to narrow the group to 45 people, who will each be interviewed separately with two attorneys from each side present. The court had requested 600 potential jurors.",
      "If prospective jurors want to speak privately, they will go into Subramanian\u2019s chambers, where the media will be excluded, he said. The transcript for those parts would be sealed.",
      "Agnifilo had expressed concern that the media\u2019s presence would prevent prospective jurors from speaking candidly.",
      "Given the amount of attention the case has received, particularly in recent days, Agnifilo asked the court to add a question to the juror survey, regarding a questionnaire already sent to prospective jurors: \u201cHave you read anything since completing the questionnaire?\u201d Subramanian agreed to do so.",
      "Comey said she understood the defense team had added two new attorneys and said prosecutors would like to know who they are. Agnifilo said that the new attorneys were in the courtroom, and that they would file their appearances by the end of the day. One of them is Xavier Donaldson, who has been present for several previous hearings.",
      "A prosecutor said at a hearing last week that Combs had been offered a plea deal, the details of which have not been made public.",
      "Subramanian asked all parties to be in his courtroom at 8 a.m. Monday and reminded them to avoid making public statements that could prejudice the trial\u2019s outcome.",
      "The reminder came in response to a court filing this week, in which Combs\u2019 attorneys asked Subramanian to bar lawyers for witnesses, including Douglas Wigdor and Lisa Bloom, who represent people who have filed separate civil suits against Combs, from speaking publicly about the trial until its conclusion.",
      "Combs attorney Teny Geragos said at Thursday\u2019s hearing that Bloom had appeared on the BBC to try to bolster her client\u2019s credibility.",
      "\u201cIt is deeply disturbing to us and could violate the rules of judicial conduct,\u201d Geragos said.",
      "Bloom represents a John Doe and Dawn Richard, who was a member of two now-defunct groups formed by Combs, Danity Kane and a second one called Diddy \u2014 Dirty Money.\u00a0Bloom told the BBC that Richard was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d of Combs.",
      "\u201cHow hypocritical that Mr. Combs and his attorneys, having made public statements many times, now want to silence me,\u201d Bloom said Thursday. \u201cAccusers and their attorneys have every right to speak out. I am very proud to represent my brave clients, Dawn Richard and John Doe, in litigation against Mr. Combs.",
      "\u201cI look forward to attending Mr. Combs\u2019 upcoming criminal trial in New York and continuing to advocate for my clients consistent with the law and the ethical rules.\u201d",
      "Richard alleged in a suit filed last year, a week before Combs was arrested, that he had groped and threatened her and that she had witnessed him assaulting his former longtime girlfriend Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura. Richards\u2019 suit is pending, along with dozens of others filed by men and women accusing Combs of sexual misconduct, which Combs has vehemently denied.",
      "Wigdor represents Ventura,\u00a0whose bombshell lawsuit filed in November 2023 preceded the federal raids of his home in March 2024 and criminal charges. Ventura accused Combs of years of physical and emotional abuse and alleged that he forced her to have sex with male sex workers \u2014 encounters she said he called \u201cfreak offs\u201d that were fueled by drugs and alcohol \u2014 while he masturbated and recorded them. Freak offs are at the center of the government\u2019s case.",
      "Ventura and Combs settled the lawsuit within a day without disclosing the terms and with Combs denying any wrongdoing.",
      "Wigdor pledged to fight Combs\u2019 efforts to prevent him from speaking publicly about the case.",
      "\u201cWe will vigorously oppose the motion seeking an extraordinary sweeping gag order as it is an obvious attempt at controlling and silencing victims and their counsel in contravention of well-established legal and ethical precedent,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cGiven this, it should come as no surprise that Combs fails to cite even one case to support his request.\u201d",
      "Combs is alleged in the five-count indictment to have coerced and threatened women to participate in sexual acts and silenced them through blackmail and violence. Prosecutors allege he had help from a network of associates and employees."

    "story": [
      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s defense team on Thursday deployed a pit bull lawyer with a history of defending notorious men to try and poke holes in the testimony of a former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant who has accused the Hollywood mogul of sexually assaulting her twice.",
      "When Miriam Haley took the stand for the third day, defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who is known for representing accused sex predators Bill Cosby and R. Kelly, grilled her about the jet-setting lifestyle that gave her access to celebrities like Weinstein.",
      "During her questioning, Bonjean got Haley to say that she didn\u2019t give reporters a complete picture of her complicated relationship with Weinstein after she first came forward with allegations that the Hollywood heavyweight had performed forcible oral sex on her in June 2006 and then, a month later, raped her.",
      "\u201cI told the part that was relevant,\u201d Haley said when Bonjean asked if she had told the press about friendly email exchanges she had with Weinstein over the years following the alleged 2006 assault.",
      "A key detail in Haley\u2019s testimony on Wednesday was that she had had her period during the time Weinstein allegedly assaulted her in 2006. During questioning from Bonjean, Haley said that she didn\u2019t remember \u201cexactly\u201d when she got her period in 2006 after the defense attorney showed Haley her calendar, where the former assistant sometimes tracked the start date of her period by writing \u201cP.\u201d",
      "Haley testified that there was no \u201cP\u201d indicated in the months of January, February and April but there was \u201csomething in March that may be a \u2018P\u2019.\u201d She said she didn\u2019t always remember to add it to her calendar and that she \u201cskipped\u201d her period some months, adding that she doesn\u2019t have a clear memory of her cycle from that year.",
      "Bonjean focused on this detail a day after Haley, in graphic detail, told the court Weinstein was not deterred during the first alleged assault when she told him she was having her period.",
      "Haley is expected to field more questions from Bonjean about the alleged assaults when court resumes on Friday.",
      "Weinstein is on trial again after the New York State Court of Appeals last year overturned his landmark 2020 conviction for sexually abusing young women which defined the #MeToo movement and helped turn the Oscar-winning producer into a pariah.",
      "Bonjean was enlisted to be part of Weinstein\u2019s defense team partly because she helped get Cosby\u2019s conviction for aggravated indecent assault overturned in 2021. But after Friday, Bonjean will no longer be representing Weinstein because she has to appear in a Brooklyn court next week for another case she is defending.",
      "Weinstein is charged with one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations that he forcibly performed oral sex on her in June 2006. He is also charged with one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting actress\u00a0Jessica Mann\u00a0in 2013.",
      "Both women were part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial and Mann is also expected to testify in his retrial.",
      "New to the retrial is an additional charge of engaging in a first-degree criminal sexual act for the alleged assault of a Polish former model named\u00a0Kaja Sokola.",
      "Sokola\u00a0claimed in a lawsuit\u00a0that she was 16 when Weinstein in 2006 performed oral sex on her without her consent at a Manhattan hotel. She, too, is expected to testify at Weinstein\u2019s retrial.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has denied assaulting Haley, Mann and Sokola.",
      "Prosecutors contend that Weinstein used his Hollywood clout to prey on young women like Haley who were searching for jobs in the TV and film industry \u2014 and to silence them after the alleged assaults.",
      "Haley, whose testimony at the retrial has largely been a reprise of the testimony she provided in 2020, has already testified that she reached out to Weinstein because she wanted his help finding a job. She has also testified that she did not report the assaults to the police or cut ties to Weinstein immediately after the assaults because she feared what he would do to her\u00a0professionally.",
      "But, under questioning from Bonjean, Haley acknowledged that Weinstein was not the first producer she tapped for job connections. She recounted that she had previously worked for British film and theater producer Michael White, and that, through White, Haley met numerous \u201cA-listers\u201d like rock stars Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney, as well as actor Jack Nicholson.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney,\u00a0Arthur Aidala, has insisted from the start of the retrial that his client\u2019s sexual encounters with the accusers were \u201ctransactional\u201d and \u201cconsensual.\u201d"

    "summary": "The anticipated rollout of updated Covid vaccines this fall might be at risk after a change by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "The anticipated rollout of updated Covid vaccines this fall might be at risk after a change by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in how vaccines are tested, experts say.",
      "Under the change by Kennedy, according to an HHS spokesperson, all new vaccines will need to go through placebo-controlled clinical trials \u2014 where some people get the actual shot and others get something inactive, like a saline shot \u2014 to compare the results.",
      "Running trials that include a placebo group is already routine for most new vaccines.",
      "The original Covid vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, approved in late 2020, went through placebo-controlled trials. But as the virus continued to mutate and the vaccines needed to be updated to match the circulating strain, drugmakers moved to a flu vaccine-like model \u2014 using smaller studies to test how well the updated shots triggered an immune response against the variant in question.",
      "Like the annual flu shot, the updated Covid vaccines weren\u2019t treated as entirely new products, since they still used the same formula, with just a tweak to what strain the vaccine would be targeting. The mRNA Covid vaccines were designed so that this change would be particularly easy to make, in the event the shots needed to be quickly updated.",
      "Quickly, in this case, turns out to be several months. In order to have enough Covid doses ready to go for the fall, vaccine-makers are told what strain to target in the spring.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee is expected to meet in May or June to make a recommendation on which strains should be included in the next round of shots. A person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the FDA had planned to schedule a meeting for May 22. An HHS spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting date.",
      "If the FDA deems Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s updated vaccines \u201cnew\u201d products, requiring fresh trials, it\u2019s extremely unlikely the doses would be ready for the fall, experts said.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, said the change would almost certainly delay the rollout of the updated shots from Pfizer and Moderna by \u201cmonths,\u201d as it would take time for the drugmakers to design the new trials and enroll participants.",
      "That would only be the start \u2014 the drugmakers would then have to run the actual trial, which would take several months on its own, at minimum, and analyze the results.",
      "Even the Covid vaccines \u2014 which were hailed as \u201cthe most successful government science program\u201d because of how quickly they were developed, according to Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at UW Medicine in Seattle \u2014 still took at least about six months to run their Phase 3 trials.",
      "The HHS spokesperson didn\u2019t directly respond to a question about whether the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would require new clinical trials.",
      "However, the spokesperson said in a statement that \u201cFDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has indicated that significant updates to existing vaccines \u2014 such as those addressing seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift \u2014 may be considered \u2018new products\u2019 requiring additional clinical evaluation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, trials from four years ago conducted in people without natural immunity no longer suffice,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cA four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data,\u201d they said, adding that the flu shot would be exempt from the new rule, because it \u201chas been tried and tested for more than 80 years.\u201d",
      "The FDA has already delayed the approval of Novavax\u2019s updated Covid vaccine, requiring the company to carry out a new clinical trial because the strain included in the shot differs from what was originally authorized.",
      "Vaccine experts panned the new requirements.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cunethical,\u201d Offit said, noting that it\u2019s generally frowned upon in the scientific community to give someone a placebo when an approved product already exists that can protect them.",
      "Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a pediatrician who played a key role in developing the rubella vaccine, said the move would make \u201cno sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat would be reasonable is to compare the old vaccine with the new vaccine to see whether the new vaccine gives better immunologic responses,\u201d Plotkin said. \u201cWe have vaccines against Covid, where we have pretty concrete ideas as to what works and what doesn\u2019t work. We know they\u2019re not perfect, but we have vaccines we know work.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Former government officials have said HHS, under Kennedy, was moving to slow-walk vaccine approvals, including by imposing new regulatory hurdles on drugmakers, such as changing the requirements for approval or seeking additional clinical trial data.",
      "Vaccine experts also fear the rule change is part of a broader effort by Kennedy to sow distrust in vaccines and limit public access to them.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to make vaccines more onerous to make, more onerous to test by bringing up these sort of false safety concerns or false efficacy concerns,\u201d Offit said.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the change is unlikely to affect brand-new vaccines. But it could have major implications for vaccines that may require updates besides Covid \u2014 like those for RSV \u2014 since placebo trials are costly and take significantly more time to conduct.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not feasible, and would lead to lots of hospitalizations and deaths,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Plotkin added that vaccines being developed for infections that are incurable, like HIV, may also be at risk.",
      "\u201cSuppose you wanted to develop a new HIV vaccine?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould you do a placebo-controlled trial in that situation? I mean exposing children to a disease which is very serious without offering them anything.\u201d"

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Why Trump waited to make his move on Mike Waltz",
      "President Donald Trump could have booted national security adviser Mike Waltz from his post at any time since the Signalgate scandal broke in March.",
      "To review, Waltz and his team let a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, into a private chat among national security officials about U.S. strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.",
      "Trump doesn\u2019t seem particularly upset about Cabinet members and top White House aides using a commercial application to communicate about sensitive government information. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth alerted his colleagues to attack plans in the Signal chat, and Trump has given no indication that the Pentagon chief is on the hot seat.",
      "Waltz\u2019s sin wasn\u2019t about evading record-keeping laws or leaving military planning visible to the wrong eyes. It was about letting a journalist in \u2014 and, in doing so, losing Trump\u2019s trust. Trump let the story burn slowly before deciding to heave Waltz into a soft landing as his nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "After all, it was in the midst of the Signalgate furor that Trump withdrew New York Rep. Elise Stefanik\u2019s nomination to the U.N. job. He had suddenly become worried that there would not be enough Republicans in the House to pass the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d for his agenda.",
      "The delayed timing of the maneuver matters for at least two reasons.",
      "First, by waiting until the story blew over, Trump gave himself room to argue that he wasn\u2019t forced into it by criticism from Democrats and Waltz\u2019s adversaries within the administration.",
      "But perhaps more importantly, the inside-baseball switcheroo \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t affect most Americans\u2019 day-to-day lives \u2014 comes at a time when Trump could use a distraction from a mudslide of tough economic news.",
      "It\u2019s true that the inflation rate has slowed a little since Trump took office, but he failed to eliminate inflation \u2014 a key campaign promise \u2014 upon being sworn in. Moreover, with his tariffs threatening to dry up supply and drive up prices, the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of the year.",
      "Trump and his allies have struggled to explain why his election did not immediately improve national economic conditions. In what might be called a dollhouse austerity pitch, Trump said this week that instead of 30 dolls, American children might have to make do with just two dolls.",
      "Extending that metaphor, his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, told reporters at the White House on Thursday morning that consumers will be willing to spend more for an American-made doll \u2014 one produced with stronger safety regulations \u2014 than a cheaper Chinese-made one.",
      "For a president elected on his vow to ease the suffering of American consumers, the short-term pain message shows how twisted he has become around the double helix of that promise and a tariff program that makes it harder to fulfill.",
      "The Waltz news served to distract the national media from the economy storyline for a full day. Perhaps the broader implications of the move, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio adding Waltz\u2019s job to his portfolio, will put focus back on Trump taking action \u2014 rather than sitting back and watching the economy gasp for air \u2014 for a few days.",
      "It\u2019s no shock that Trump wanted to remove Waltz from his job. It made a lot of political sense for him to wait.",
      "Trump\u2019s deportation campaign is capitalizing on a key hallmark: Speed",
      "A deportation flight carrying immigrants to El Salvador took off while a judge was ruling in the case. A mother of two U.S. citizens was sent to Honduras without speaking to anyone other than immigration officials. College students have been suddenly arrested on city streets and sent to detention centers hundreds of miles away.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s promise to carry out the biggest deportation campaign in American history has a distinct and potent hallmark: speed. Officials have fast-tracked deportation proceedings so that some people are removed without speaking to an attorney, family members or without a court hearing at all.",
      "Trump\u2019s immigration efforts have broken norms and bent the law as he enacts his agenda with dizzying fervor, seeking to show his supporters he\u2019s delivering, even as the overall number of deportations in February lagged behind the Biden administration during the same period last year.",
      "Trump\u2019s first-term push to drastically reshape the nation\u2019s immigration system was often stymied by the courts, slowed down because of the officials around him, or undone over a tide of public criticism. The president has been emboldened in his second term, surrounded by loyalists in a nation that has moved to the right on immigration.",
      "\u201cThis is a much more powerful presidency than I had the first time,\u201d Trump recently told The Atlantic. \u201cThe first time, I was fighting for survival and I was fighting to run the country. This time I\u2019m fighting to help the world and to help the country.\u201d",
      "Even as Trump slams individual judges publicly, he and his aides have stressed that they will abide by court rulings. Still, administration officials are testing that line.",

      "Just after McCutchen's dramatic two-run double gave the Pirates a 4-3 lead in the seventh inning Wednesday night, a fan spilled over the Roberto Clemente Wall in right field and appeared to lie motionless before first responders rushed him to the hospital.",
      "\"We're devastated of the situation that took place yesterday,\" McCutchen said Thursday. \"So we all came in here together as a team after the game and said a prayer for him. We hope the best for him and his family. \"",
      "McCutchen, one of the team's most popular players, said he hopes the man's loved ones know that players are concerned.",
      "\"We\u2019re all thinking about him and just praying for the best for him,\" McCutchen said. \"I hope he pulls through. And yes, it was a tough situation. So yeah, we\u2019re definitely thinking about him.\"",
      "The fan was identified Thursday as standout high school football player Kavan Markwood, a spokesperson for the South Allegheny School District said in a statement. He is 20, according to public records.",
      "Markwood, who graduated from South Allegheny High School in 2022, was named team MVP and earned first team all-conference honors, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"Kavan is best known for his resilience, strength, and kindness,\" the spokesperson said. \"He is a friend to all \u2014 someone who lifts others up and faces challenges with courage and grace.\"",
      "Markwood remains hospitalized in serious condition, according to the statement.",
      "The shocking moment was captured in viral video by fan Bobby Ketter, who didn't immediately know what he had recorded.",
      "Ketter was at the game with his father, celebrating his dad's recovery from a stroke, and they were cheering for McCutchen's big hit.",
      "\"It was a couple minutes before I really realized that I had the video,\" he told NBC News on Thursday. \"Then next thing you know, people are pounding, piling around me and watching it over my shoulder. And that\u2019s when we all realized what happened.\"",
      "Ketter said he was struck by the sudden quiet of what had been wild cheers coming from the\u00a011,297 paid fans.",
      "\"It was eerie silence,\" he said. \"You saw the players taking a knee. You could see the gentleman on the warning track, and he has shut off, and everyone\u2019s very confused.\"",
      "Ketter praised medical personnel who acted fast: \"You know what honestly? Shoutout to PNC Park. The EMS, they were quick, were right there.\"",
      "While law enforcement is investigating, the fall is believed to have been an accidental, not a criminal act, Pittsburgh Public Safety said in a statement."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are at loggerheads over the fate of a controversial tax deduction that is critical to winning enough votes in the House to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "After a week of meetings and discussions, Republicans still haven\u2019t settled on how to handle the state and local tax deduction, also known as \u201cSALT,\u201d which allows filers to deduct up to $10,000 in taxes paid to state and local governments. Before the House adjourned for the week on Thursday, GOP lawmakers on opposite ends of the spectrum continued to snipe over whether to raise that $10,000 maximum imposed by the 2017 Trump tax cuts.",
      "Pro-SALT Republicans insist it\u2019s not enough to lift the cap to $15,000 for individuals and $30,000 for married couples. Party leaders are looking at a higher cap, nixing the \u201cmarriage penalty\u201d and potentially an income threshold to limit the deduction to the middle class, according to lawmakers and sources with knowledge of the talks.",
      "There is no consensus in the GOP\u2019s narrow House majority. It is a sensitive topic after several Republicans in high-tax areas lost their re-election races in 2018 after backing the 2017 tax law that imposed the $10,000 cap. A new crop of GOP lawmakers has since won re-election by promising to raise that cap, but doing so would be expensive and complicate the rest of the bill, which also seeks to boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military, as well as raise the debt limit.",
      "SALT is one of many contentious issues in the package, but it is the most unique. Many Republicans \u2014 across ideological lines \u2014 care little about the deduction and would be content to avoid expanding it. But there is no path to passing a bill without catering to the roughly dozen Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California who have made it a red line.",
      "Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only \u201cSALT Caucus\u201d member who serves on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said she had briefed her fellow committee members Thursday morning about negotiations following a SALT-focused meeting a day earlier with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",
      "While there is no deal on numbers yet, Malliotakis said discussions include limiting the SALT deduction to families making less than $400,000 per year. She said the new cap could be boosted to slightly higher than $25,000.",
      "\u201cThere is general consensus that we have no interest in supporting millionaires and billionaires, and this needs to be targeted relief for middle class families,\u201d Malliotakis, who represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s what this comes down to \u2014 what number can provide the most relief for middle class families that is acceptable to other members of the conference.\u201d",
      "She said the issue wouldn\u2019t be resolved this week, but sounded optimistic that they will ultimately get \u201csomething real approved by the committee.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going over all of the menu of options,\u201d Malliotakis said, \u201cand eventually we will get to the right number.\u201d",
      "If Trump\u2019s tax cuts expire, the SALT cap would reset to infinity, at a cost of $1.2 trillion over a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington research group that advocates for lower deficits. GOP leaders want to contain the price tag of any SALT policy to make room for other priorities.",
      "The Ways and Means Committee still hasn\u2019t released the text of its bill or scheduled a hearing to vote on sending it to the floor, although House GOP leaders want it to happen next week to stick to their schedule of passing the entire package out of the chamber by Memorial Day.",
      "Democrats are guaranteed to attack SALT limits imposed by Republicans as an attempt to raise taxes on residents of blue states, which hold enough swing districts to decide control of the House.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any magic number where it\u2019s not a fertile attack line for Democrats, so at a certain point SALT members just have to take yes for an answer,\u201d said Liam Donovan, a lobbyist and former GOP aide, who said the cap is likely to end up above $10,000 but well short of the $100,000 pro-SALT members appear to want.",
      "\u201cTo me, the best way to indemnify yourself politically is to make the number as big as possible but with an income phase-out,\u201d he said. \u201cHard to attack Republicans if you can\u2019t claim it hurts middle class families. The poster child is ostensibly the cop or firefighter who has a big property tax bill, which is a relatively cheap and easy problem to fix.\u201d",
      "Conservative Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he opposes the SALT deduction and criticized his colleagues for pushing it.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have such high local taxes and the federal government shouldn\u2019t subsidize it. So I\u2019m not all that interested in hearing about my blue-state colleagues complaining about it,\u201d Roy said, while adding that he\u2019s only willing to accept a higher SALT cap if it is offset with spending cuts.",
      "\u201cYou have to figure out how to get a deal done. So if the math adds up and we\u2019re doing enough on the spending restraint side and the tax policy works out and SALT goes up a little, whatever, we\u2019ll work it out,\u201d Roy told reporters. \u201cI just don\u2019t support that policy.\u201d",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who represents a competitive district outside New York City, is demanding a higher SALT deduction, noting that his state gives more to the federal government than it takes, unlike many red states.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue of fairness. For my colleagues that talk about bad blue-state policies, the fact is New York is a donor state. Many of my colleagues from red states actually get more money from the federal government than tax revenue that is sent to the federal government,\u201d Lawler, who is considering a run for governor of New York, told reporters. \u201cSo if we want to talk about subsidies, then we can talk about subsidies, but the fact is that New Yorkers need tax relief. That\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for in this bill.\u201d",
      "Lawler\u2019s colleague, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is also weighing a run for governor and has been talking up SALT recently. That could make her another difficult vote for Johnson.",
      "Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., who represents a Long Island district that was hit hard by the 2017 GOP law\u2019s SALT cap, said this week that boosting the deduction is essential to winning his support for the reconciliation package.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all in on the SALT provision,\u201d LaLota told reporters. \u201cMy folks didn\u2019t just send me here for my great good looks. They sent me here to fight for SALT, and I intend to win that fight.\u201d"

      "Laura Day saw her friend Demi Moore\u2019s second pregnancy coming. Moore wrote about the prediction in the introduction to Day\u2019s 1996 book, \u201cPractical Intuition,\u201d calling the intuitive a \u201cremarkable woman with a remarkable abilities.\u201d",
      "Day\u2019s debut was a handbook for \u201crediscovering\u201d intuition, as she put it, and seeing its transformative power firsthand. Thirty years later, Day continues to publish books that distill her unique perspective on the world into gifts for her readers.",
      "Her latest, \u201cThe Prism,\u201d out April 29, is a series of exercises of how people can identify where they need changes. \u201cThis is the framework for how you build yourself to build a life that you want,\u201d Day tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThe Prism\u201d by Laura Day",
      "\"The Prism\" by Laura Day",
      "She\u2019s written bestsellers on teaching intuition \u2014 but books, she says, are not how she pays the bills.",
      "A working intuitive, Day uses her abilities to guide companies\u2019 investing decisions and says she is on retainer at several companies (four, to be precise).",
      "She also gives regular readings for her coterie of famous friends, including actors like Moore (the two are still close, she says) and Brad Pitt, who blurbed the book.",
      "Day's husband, the writer and former skeptic Steven Schiff, chimes in during the interview to give instances of telepathy, detailing a time he helped a friend track down a cat states away.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s very generous when she thinks everyone can do this. I think almost nobody can do what she does. Yeah can she teach people to be in touch? Yeah. And have I also seen her like, bring out gifts that people didn\u2019t know? Oh yeah,\u201d he says, counting himself among them.",
      "While she\u2019s made a living, and a good one, by making individualized predictions, she shirks the label \u201cpsychic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did not want to be known as a psychic,\u201d she says, sharing that she only wrote her first book because she \u201chad to\u201d make \u201ca lot of money very quickly\u201d while raising her son. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write books about intuition. I definitely did not want my face on those books. I come from a family of three generations of scientists.\u201d",
      "Speaking of family, \u201cThe Prism\u201d also gives insight into the making of an intuitive mind. Day gets into the her harrowing upbringing, the oldest of four children to, what she describes as, a narcissistic father and a manic-depressive mother. Her parents bought an adjoining New York apartment to house their children. Essentially raising her younger siblings, Day writes she was aided by the \u201cimaginary friends\u201d who never went away.",
      "Day went on to lose her mother and two of her siblings to suicide. She\u2019s come to think of her intuition as the compass she used to make decisions, using information that did not come from within her but was given to her.",
      "\u201cWhy did I survive? I realized that intuition gave me a framework for what a healthy human being was and how that healthy human being should interface with the structure of the world. But it was so subconscious, and it gave it to me because I had three younger children to take care of,\u201d she says.",
      "She says people are their own \u201cmagic wands,\u201d and her books are meant to teach people how to use their own abilities rather than outsource them.",
      "\u201cTelling the future? That\u2019s a really good skill, and it\u2019s been helpful for me, and certainly I\u2019ve made a career of it. But more important is being able to change your present so you can change that future,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, Day opens up about her latest book \u2014 and why she says it\u2019s her last self-help.",
      "People who become very successful are very intuitive, but they\u2019re often intuitive in little parts of their lives. So, some of the other parts of their lives sometimes crumble around them. They need to be intuitive, because intuition is a survival skill. And what people don\u2019t realize about celebrities: you are always under attack. Even if they\u2019re beloved, they live in a hostile world.",
      "I really feel like \u201cThe Prism\u201d is the answer to, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d And, \u201cHow do I make it right? What\u2019s wrong with my life, and how do I make it right?\u201d The answer is never inside of you. We\u2019re held together by our patterns, but our patterns are also our jailers. They keep us stuck. You have to try something new on something you cannot think outside the box. You are the box. You can only imagine from what you\u2019ve been exposed to. You can intuit something else, though, and this book has a lot of different ways, again, to find the little alleys in your conscious mind where intuition can be found.",
      "My former books are very much about intuition, right? \u201cThe Prism\u201d really is about life. It\u2019s so important to me, and it is my last self-help book. I\u2019m writing memoir next.",
      "Yes, and I have no boundaries, so I often just give them the answers. But I find that there you can give somebody the answer and they don\u2019t do that much for you. That\u2019s why \u201cThe Prism\u201d gives you tiny behavioral shifts. Your world will change, and then you\u2019ll change as a result of your opportunities will change and your health.",
      "I very rarely don\u2019t say anything. That\u2019s why I always know my friends are doing something they shouldn\u2019t be doing when they don\u2019t call me. Because I have, you know, I have learned to have more of a filter. Believe me, I was not popular in third grade.",
      "I find the solution and I find the solution that they can do. And that\u2019s what \u201cThe Prism\u201d is about. Because a solution that someone can\u2019t do is not a solution. It takes more baggage. I find the solution that they can do, and then I give them a timeline so they can experience that.",
      "What I\u2019ll also sometimes do is see something coming up or someone coming up that will mitigate the pain, and then I\u2019ll say a couple things that are going to happen between now and then, so that they can verify it.",
      "Knowing the answers leads to \u2014 I mean, listen, I think the most courageous thing is to be human. It takes a lot of courage to be an aware human being. Seeing the future can be really scary because there are some things you can\u2019t do anything about. There\u2019s a lot you can and my precognition has saved my life quite a few times. But it\u2019s also let me know things that were too heartbreaking to know, and it also let me know too much so that I had to spend a lot of energy on repressing what I knew. Everything is a mixed bag. I am grateful for my gift."

      "While \"The Names\" is Knapp's debut novel, she's previously written a nonfiction book about a method of quilt-making, and she says she's been writing fiction longer than she's been quilting.",

It might influence whether we're get invited in for a job or meet a prospective partner or something like that,\" she adds. \"But then I was also interested in how it might shape our own sense of self.\"",
      "So enter Bear, Julian and Gordon. Knapp says she wanted to pick at least one more traditional name that could be handed down for generations, but that she was most interested in the associations that people could bring to each name.",

And Anne \u2014 perhaps the show\u2019s emotional anchor \u2014supports Ginny, who is pregnant with Nick\u2019s child.",
      "When asked if Anne is finally free from the expectations she once carried in her marriage, Kenney-Silver says: \u201cI think Anne lived to be needed. The idea that her entire marriage might have been a mirage was terrifying. But in that final moment with Ginny, she realizes two things can be true\u2014Nick loved Ginny, but he also loved her. The 25 years they shared were real.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not a perfect resolution \u2014 but it\u2019s honest. And that\u2019s what \"The Four Seasons\" does best: show that truth and messiness can coexist.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a love story to all sorts of long relationships\u2014including platonic ones. But yeah, not all marriages are meant to last forever. Some endings are necessary,\" writer Tracey Wigfield says."

    "story": [
      "A dusty country setting. Cowboy hats and printed shawls. A mighty delicious, generation-spanning family drama tied to property investments.",
      "No, this isn't \"Yellowstone.\" This is \"Ransom Canyon,\" Netflix's new Western based on the book series by the same name that author Jodi Thomas tells TODAY.com is actually very \"different than 'Yellowstone.'\"",
      "\"The men in (Ransom Canyon) are flawed and still love their family and land even when they are arguing,\" Thomas tells TODAY.com over email. \"This series has something for everyone.\"",
      "Thomas compliments the show, which premiered on April 17, particularly showrunner April Blair's depiction of the series, noting that she tells the story \"through a woman's gaze\" but the focus remains on \"character, family, love and legacy.\"",
      "\"It's about ranches and problems, but told in a different way,\" she says.",
      "Thomas says the way the series characters \u2014 particularly some of its leads like Staten Kirkland (Josh Duhamel), Quinn O'Grady (Minka Kelly) and Cap Fuller (James Brolin) \u2014 have come to life is exactly as she \"envisioned them\" when she wrote them, even if their plot lines differ from the books.",
      "One major change? In Thomas' novel, Quinn becomes pregnant. That plotline is omitted from the show.",
      "Minka Kelly tells TODAY.com that she didn\u2019t read the books since she knew the show would be headed in its own direction.",
      "\u201cI knew that April was going to be translating it in a really specific way, so I didn\u2019t read it,\u201d she says. \u201cI just really relied on the scripts and trusted the writers and used their words.\u201d",
      "Thomas, however, isn't upset by these changes. In fact, she adores the additions made to the tale.",
      "\"(Blair) turned these characters and my story into a compelling, bingeable series and I love the subplots and twists she\u2019s added,\" Thomas says. \"I wasn\u2019t involved, although I did get to visit the set and I had a wonderful time seeing my characters come to life. It was really a thrill and so impressive. Netflix has treated me and my book well.\"",
      "Whether its book or show, \"Ransom Canyon\" is full of romance, just as Thomas intended.",
      "Thomas, who says she \"fell in love at 17 and I've never stopped,\" likes writing romance because \"romance makes people feel good and gives them hope and we certainly could use more of that in the world.\"",
      "\"I would love to touch your heart and not just your mind,\" she continues. \"My wish is that my books and this show give people hope and good feelings and that\u2019s really the point of entertainment in my mind. At the end of the day we want to feel deeply and care.\"",
      "The main love story in the books and the show belongs to Staten and Quinn. Their romance comes from her belief that \"people love long and never stop.\"",
      "\"I've always written love stories because I really believe in the power of love,\" she says.",
      "Thomas believes Staten's character keeps people reading the books and watching the show as he gives you something to root for. When viewers first meet Staten in the show, he's a lonely rancher still grieving the loss of his wife and child.",
      "\"He was definitely a rich rancher, but he\u2019s lost all he really valued,\" Thomas says. \"I\u2019ve always written about people that have gone through a lot because that\u2019s where the really great stories come from. The reader cares deeply about such flawed characters and is rooting for them.\"",
      "Thomas, who has published over 50 books all set in Texas, comes from five generations of Texans. She says writing about the state is \"in (her) blood.\"",
      "Read the \u2018Ransom Canyon\u2019 books in order",

      "Since Thomas has already penned eight books in the \"Ransom Canyon\" series, she hopes that the TV show gets greenlit for future seasons so some of her other characters have the chance to be brought to life and shine.",
      "\"There will be new characters for readers with their own love stories in the other books in the series,\" she says. \"I am hoping we get more seasons of the show so that some of these characters may make an appearance but fans of the show can read ahead and see more of this world I created.\""

      "A card at the end of the series briefly mentions the allegations, which emerged earlier this year in Season 3 of the Investigation Discovery documentary \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, multiple people who knew Grace and the Manses accused the family of physically and financially abusing Natalia and other children in their care.",
      "The Manses have denied these abuse claims. TODAY.com has reached out to the Mans family for comment and has not heard back.",

      "\u201cI think Natalia had been in a really bad state when Cynthia met her, and I think that there was a lot of love there. So it was really devastating to learn late after the fact, after we\u2019d been shooting, that there were these abuse allegations,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Sutherland says the show\u2019s plotline is \u201cvery specific to a certain time period\u201d and that the recently surfaced allegations \u201cdidn\u2019t affect the current time period we were covering.\u201d",
      "Creator Katie Robbins also notes that the show\u2019s ending, while it doesn\u2019t incorporate the latest real-life allegations against the Manses, captures what her team set out to achieve with the series.",
      "\u201cThe themes that we\u2019re grappling with are the elusive nature of truth and the pervasiveness of bias, and so ending the story where we do felt like the most potent way to get at those issues,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cThey adopt and get kids for money,\u201d he says in the docuseries. \u201cIt\u2019s not about love; it\u2019s all about the money, what they can get.\u201d",
      "The documentary also includes allegations that the Manses physically abused Grace and other children under their care.",
      "Anna Newlin, who had a child under the Manses\u2019 care at the time she was interviewed, told the documentary\u2019s producers that Grace \u201cused to get beat on all the time,\u201d and claimed the Manses were \u201cviolent\u201d toward Grace, alleging that they \u201chit her with a belt\u201d and \u201cknocked her down the stairs.\u201d",

      "Perry responded to a video of the ad posted to a fan account on Instagram, writing in a comment that she is able to remain true to herself, \"heart open and honest,\" because of the bond she has with her fans.",
      "\"Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,\" she said. \"My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, 'No one can make you believe something about yourself that you don\u2019t already believe about yourself,' and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it\u2019s an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it.",
      "\"When the 'online' world tries to make me a human Pi\u00f1ata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed,\" she continued.",
      "Perry said that what is real to her is seeing her fans in the crowd every night, \"singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth.\"",
      "\"I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that,\" she said, adding an infinity emoji.",
      "\"I\u2019m not perfect, and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I\u2019m on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but\u2026 I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS,\" she added.",
      "Perry's comment came after her \"Lifetimes\" tour began on April 23 in Mexico City. The singer has since faced criticism for the show's choreography and stage design from social media users online.",
      "Earlier this month, Perry was also part of the all-female flight crew that took a roughly 10-minute trip to space aboard a Blue Origin spacecraft. The flight quickly garnered controversy, as everyday people, fast-food companies and celebrities, like Olivia Munn and\u00a0Emily Ratajkowski, questioned the sustainability of a trip to space.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Munn said while co-hosting TODAY With Jenna & Friends on April 3. \u201cIs it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it\u2019s a bit gluttonous. ... Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they going to do up there that has made it better for us down here?\u201d",
      "Perry did not directly respond to the criticism of the flight, but several of her fellow crew members like Lauren Sanchez, Gayle King and Aisha Bowe did during a press conference on April 14.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you steal our joy, but most people are really excited and cheering us on and realize what this mission means to young women, young girls and boys, too,\u201d King said.",
      "\u201cI feel anybody that\u2019s criticizing doesn\u2019t really understand what is happening here,\u201d she added, later in the press conference. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it, we\u2019ve all heard it and we were even all talking about that, and I hope that they will do a deep dive into what this represents.\u201d",
      "Sanchez, the fianc\u00e9e of Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, also shared her perspective.",
      "\u201cI get really fired up a little bit on this,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI would love to have them come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees that don\u2019t just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle. ... They love their work and they love the mission and it\u2019s a big deal for them.\"",
      "\u201cSo when we hear comments like that, I just say, \u2018Trust me. Come with me. I\u2019ll show you what this is about, and it\u2019s really eye-opening,\u2019\u201d she continued."

      "TODAY.com can exclusively reveal the brand new cover of the special edition, set to publish Oct. 7, 2025.",
      "\"My Brilliant Friend\" first published in English in 2012, introducing readers to Lila and Elena, or Len\u00f9, and their complicated friendship from age 6 well into adulthood.",
      "Their relationship is spotlighted in the novel's three sequels, \"The Story of a New Name,\" \"Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay\" and finally, \"The Story of the Lost Child,\" which was published in English in 2015. All four were translated from Italian by Ann Goldstein.",
      "Ferrante, an anonymous Italian author, is also known for writing \"The Days of Abandonment.\" In 2024, the New York Times published a list of the 100 best books of the 21st century, and \"My Brilliant Friend\" topped the list at No. 1.",
      "Europa Editions Executive Publisher Michael Reynolds said in statement, \"This single-volume edition reflects more truly the author\u2019s conception of the story of Lila and Len\u00fa as one long saga.\"",
      "\"Designed and printed in Italy, this is going to be a beautiful object and a worthy celebration of an unforgettable, history-making work of literature,\" Reynolds said.",
      "The special edition consists of 1,248 pages. The new cover is typographic, spotlighting the opening lines of \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d in bright pink against a black background.",
      "\"My friendship with Lila began the day we decided to go up the dark stairs that led, step after step, flight after flight, to the door of Don Achille's apartment. I remember the violet light of the courtyard, the smells of a warm spring evening,\" the cover reads.",
      "Ginevra Rapisardi, who designed the new cover, told TODAY.com in a written interview that she wanted the cover \"to speak directly through the text, with a strong and immediate emotional pull.\"",
      "Initially, she said she attempted \"a few figurative and graphic attempts that didn\u2019t seem entirely convincing.\"",
      "\"It occurred to me that Elena Ferrante\u2019s true strength lies in her words, and that perhaps there was no need to add anything else,\" Rapisardi said. \"The opening of 'My Brilliant Friend' is wonderful and immediately evokes the tone and intensity of the story. It seemed a perfect \u2014 almost inevitable \u2014 solution.\"",
      "The goal of the color scheme was to achieve \"clear contrast,\" she said.",
      "\"It was important that the two colors stood in clear contrast, while still feeling harmonious and balanced \u2014 so that this chromatic dualism could, in some way, reflect the very nature of the novel,\" she said.",
      "The special edition notably achieves a very different look from the original covers. The original cover of \"My Brilliant Friend\" depicted a realistic wedding scene against the backdrop of a body of water. In the image, a bride and groom are walking away, followed by three young flower girls.",
      "The new cover aims to pay homage to the original covers through the colorful edges of the book.",
      "\"The image of the Gulf of Naples printed along the edges of the volume, which then continues onto the endpapers, is a clear homage to the original cover of 'My Brilliant Friend' and a visual element that evokes the heart of the story \u2014 its relationship with the city of Naples,\" Rapisardi said.",
      "Rapisardi said the design team also considered another \"iconic\" line from the books, \"You\u2019re my brilliant friend, you have to be the best of all, boys and girls,\" but noted it was \"quite short.\" Instead, those words can be found on the endpapers of the special edition, printed over the continued motif of the Gulf of Naples from the book's edges.",
      "The special edition, which is currently available for preorder for $65, is clothbound, and the words on the cover are \"hot-stamped,\" meaning they are engraved into the fabric, Rapisardi said.",
      "\"The legacy of 'My Brilliant Friend' is that of a universal story, one that has spoken to readers around the world with an authentic, profound, and powerful voice,\" Rapisardi said. \"The new cover aims to convey precisely that: the power of the written word.\""

    "summary": "Christie Brinkley sits down with TODAY.com to talk about her new memoir \"Uptown Girl\" and her 11-year marriage to music legend Billy Joel.",
    "story": [
      "Christie Brinkley, one of the most recognizable faces in modeling, offers a revealing glimpse into the challenges of being one of the world's original supermodels in her new memoir, \"Uptown Girl.\"",
      "Gracing the cover of more than 500 magazines and appearing in memorable movies like the 1983 hit film, \"National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\" Brinkley's career spans five decades, and she delves into much of it in her new book.",
      "\"I just want to tell some stories,\" Brinkley tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"I hope it'll be a nice diversion in a world that can use a good book every now and then, take you away on a little adventure.\"",
      "From being discovered at a payphone in Paris to being kicked out of Frank Sinatra's hotel room, \"Uptown Girl\" offers insight behind Brinkley's upbringing in Southern California and her ascent to the top of the modeling world. The book also explores her four marriages (and divorces), including 11 years she spent with Billy Joel.",
      "It's the music legend who penned \"Uptown Girl,\" the song that inspired the memoir's title, which has become Brinkley's enduring nickname \u2014 in spite of the fact that, according to the supermodel, it wasn't initially written for her.",
      "Brinkley writes in her memoir that it started out as a song for a \"mystery girl\" Joel had been having phone conversations with, but when his relationship with Brinkley began, he finished it in her honor. Their relationship was then immortalized in the hit song's iconic music video, in which Brinkley appears in.",
      "'Dancing in the kitchen' with Billy Joel",
      "In \"Uptown Girl,\" Brinkley, 71, opens up about her various heartbreaks, difficult early childhood with an abusive father and the helicopter accident that almost claimed her life in 1994. However, the model says that opening up about her marriage to Joel was the most difficult part of penning the memoir.",
      "\"The hardest thing to include was criticism of Billy, because I do care about my friendship with him,\" she says of the chapters that reveal Joel's heavy drinking and suggested affairs, which has been making headlines since her book came out.",
      "\"In the book, I feel like I balanced, very much, about how happy we were and how joy-filled our days were,\" she says of their marriage. \"It was literally dancing in the kitchen as we cooked, singing together, and making each other laugh. It was a beautiful, wonderful relationship.\"",
      "According to the memoir, that relationship became strained, in part, after Joel sued Frank Weber, his former manager, for having allegedly siphoned off his profits. It was a betrayal that Brinkley writes left Joel \"withdrawn and stressed\" as singer-songwriter felt immense pressure to recoup his financial loss.",
      "\"He was going through extraordinary circumstances in his life, things most people wouldn't ever have to deal with,\" she describes.",
      "Despite the vulnerable nature of the admissions, Brinkley says they were important to include in the memoir. \"I did have to go there because that was the reality.\"",
      "Brinkley tells TODAY.com that Joel had given his blessing to talk candidly about the ups and downs of their longtime relationship.",
      "\"He said, 'Just say what you need to say,'\" Brinkley recalls. \"And I think that's part of his healing, so I applaud him for all of that. It takes a lot of courage.\"",
      "The new memoir reveals some darker times in their relationship, including instances of Brinkley waking up in the middle of the night to discover Joel was missing, then him returning home in the wee hours of the morning after being out drinking all night.",
      "She also writes about the growing distance in their marriage that ultimately left her feeling \"lonely, despite the fact that he was right there.\" It was a loneliness so pervasive that Brinkley was thinking about Joel as she boarded a helicopter in Colorado, shortly after their separation in 1994, and wondered if the crooner would be worried about her embarking on a trip to go heli-skiing.",
      "\"For a moment I thought about my husband, Billy, whom I'd split with again, and hoping this trip to Telluride would wake him up to the reality that he might actually lose me,\" she writes.",
      "What she didn't know was that shortly after, the helicopter would crash into the San Juan mountains, leaving Brinkley and several companions temporarily stranded until they were rescued.",
      "Though Joel ultimately flew to her side and jetted her back to Long Island aboard a private plane, her dream of their reunion was dashed when she overheard him on the phone saying to an unknown caller, 'No, don't worry. I'm not going back to her. I just need to see her through this.'\"",
      "The revelation brought home the fact that their marriage was over. Two weeks later, they announced their divorce and as she penned in her memoir, \"the dream broke apart like debris.\"",
      "Despite their divorce, Brinkley tells TODAY.com that they still remain friends.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very loyal guy. He\u2019s loyal to his friends, he\u2019s generous. He just had a lot of stresses on him at the point when we were together and it just kind of came crashing down on us.\u201d",
      "'I was raised to be grateful'",
      "Outside of her marriage, the helicopter crash changed her life in other ways.",
      "\"I went through a phase of post-traumatic stress disorder,\" she says of the accident that left her clinging to the side of a mountain amid a pile of helicopter wreckage.",
      "\"One of the hallmarks is bad decision-making. And I made quite a few, which I lay out in the book and that chapter was hard to write just because I didn't want to think about any of (the helicopter crash). I didn't want to go back to that place. At the time when it happened, I actually thought it was so awful, I wanted to purge it from my body and from my memory banks.\"",
      "While she's endured her fair share of trauma, Brinkley remains the eternal optimist, both in love and life.",
      "\"I was raised in a very positive household, so I was raised to be grateful and counting my blessings and to know the good things that I have, no matter what,\" she says.",
      "Among those blessings are Brinkley\u2019s three children: Alexa Ray Joel, 39, her daughter with Joel, as well as her son, Jack Brinkley-Cook, 29, and other daughter, Sailor Brinkley-Cook, 26, both of whom she shares with her ex-husband Peter Cook.",
      "While appearing on the April 28 episode of TODAY, Brinkley shared that out of her three children, her oldest daughter is the one who's read most of her memoir and that she loves it.",
      "\"She was kind of blown away by it,\" said Brinkley.",
      "As for the other two, the model joked that her younger children \"skimmed through\" it and said, \"We know her!\" but otherwise, \"I don't think they understand the reason to read it.\"",
      "'This is not a revenge novel'",
      "Though Brinkley has released two other books, including a 1983 fitness book and \"Timeless Beauty,\" a wellness guide published in 2015, \"Uptown Girl\" is her first memoir, and she wants readers to take something positive away from her experiences.",
      "\"I just really hope people understand that the book is much more than rehashing divorces,\" she explains, referring to her other marriages to Jean-Francois\u00a0Allaux, Richard Taubman and Cook, all of which ended in divorce.",
      "\"This is not a revenge novel. It's filled with joy and when there are bad moments, it's sort of how to keep going and not let them pull you down,\" she says. \"And how to stay positive and maybe learn something from it or let it propel you into someplace that you didn't dare go before.\"",
      "CORRECTION\u00a0(April 30, 2025, 9:22 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated how long Christie Brinkley and Billy Joel were married. They were married for 9 years, not 11."

      "His opponent, Peter Dutton, has pushed the Liberals further to the right since becoming party leader in 2022.",
      "His nods to Trump include pledging to slash 41,000 public service jobs, proposing to reduce legal migration to Australia and appointing a shadow minister for government efficiency, prompting his opponents to call him \u201cDOGE-y Dutton.\u201d",
      "Though Dutton says he\u2019s his \u201cown person,\u201d his association with Trump appears to have become a liability among Australian voters, said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University.",
      "\u201cDutton, perhaps overenthusiastically, endorsed President Trump\u2019s victory without recognizing how difficult that would make his position \u2014 not with the bolted-on right, but with the swing voters, the center of the center, where all elections are won in Australia,\u201d he said.",
      "A poll released last month by the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the United States \u2014 the lowest in the annual poll\u2019s two-decade history.",
      "Blaxland described Trump\u2019s disregard for long-standing alliances and his quid pro quo approach to U.S. foreign policy as \u201cvertigo inducing\u201d for politicians, policymakers and voters in Australia, where voting is mandatory.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s \u201chyperrealist, short-term, transactional approach to its relationships is deeply unsettling and corrosive of goodwill,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has treated Australia as just another freeloader, slapping a 10% tariff on all exports to the U.S., even though the U.S. generally runs a trade surplus with Australia rather than a deficit. (In a rare deviation, Australia reported Thursday that it sold more to the U.S. than it bought in the first quarter as investors spooked by Trump\u2019s tariffs rushed to buy gold, one of Australia\u2019s top metals exports.)",
      "While 81% of Australians disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the vast majority (80%) continue to say the U.S. alliance is important for Australia\u2019s security.",
      "Those numbers reflect the economic and security dichotomy Australia faces: how to balance its security ties with the U.S. and its trade interests with China.",
      "Albanese has spent his prime ministership working to stabilize relations with China, which nosedived under the previous conservative government, prompting China to impose punishing trade restrictions.",
      "China is Australia\u2019s largest two-way trading partner, accounting for 25% of the country\u2019s goods and services trade in 2023-24. The U.S. is Australia\u2019s third-largest two-way trading partner and largest source of foreign investment.",
      "If the United States, which has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, \u201creally damages the Chinese economy, then that is going to have a major impact on Australia,\u201d said Stuart Rollo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.",
      "Rollo said he worries Australia could be caught in the middle if the U.S. tries to pressure its allies to reduce their economic ties with Beijing.",
      "\u201cSo much of our future prosperity is tied with Chinese growth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor us to make the decision to disconnect from that \u2014 because we need American protection forever \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a real cost to the living standards of Australians moving forward.\u201d",
      "Without the U.S., however, Australia would be cut off from critical military technology and far less protected against Chinese aggression.",
      "Australia\u2019s vulnerability was on display in February when the Chinese military conducted live-fire drills off the country\u2019s coast, forcing dozens of commercial flights to reroute.",
      "That\u2019s why Australian politicians on both sides of the aisle say they remain committed to AUKUS, the security pact among Australia, the U.S. and Britain, even as Australians question whether they can still rely on the U.S. for their defense.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re this kind of Anglo, European-transplanted community sitting on the edge of Asia, and [that] drives our fear of abandonment, which drives us towards the United States,\u201d Blaxland said.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia is set to buy several nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. as a deterrent against China.",
      "But Australia would struggle to pay for those submarines without its trade relationship with China, said James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\u201cThis is a big cost problem for a small economy like Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t go all in on AUKUS, all in on the United States, all in on containing China and imagine that our trade with China, which is paying for our submarines, can actually be sustained. It can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Both Albanese and Dutton have downplayed any uncertainty around U.S. relations, but Laurenceson believes cracks are emerging in bipartisan support for the alliance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll say that our security alliance with the U.S. is much more than just about one administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true, but Trump is certainly challenging that.\u201d"

      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",

      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",

    "story": [
      "Even in death, Pope Francis\u2019 moral voice rang out across the world.",
      "With 40,000 packed into Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, another 250,000 in the surrounding streets and millions more watching on TV and online, world leaders, including President Donald Trump, were reminded of Francis\u2019 central messages during his funeral Saturday.",
      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "Francis\u2019 casket was taken on a final journey in the so-called popemobile through the streets of Rome, past landmarks such as the Colosseum, to St. Mary Major Basilica, where he had chosen to be buried.",
      "The people lining the streets had come from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",
      "Nevertheless, despite scandal within the church and uncertainty without, there was plenty of Francis\u2019 platform that few would disagree with.",
      "Re reflected this while closing the homily: \u201cEmbrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 State prosecutors in Thailand said Thursday that they don\u2019t intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.",
      "The arrest last month of Paul Chambers, a political science lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, had drawn concern from the academic community, especially from Asian studies scholars around the world, as well as the U.S. government.",
      "The decision not to prosecute Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native, does not immediately clear him of the charge of insulting the monarchy \u2014 also known as \u201cl\u00e8se majest\u00e9\u201d \u2014 or a related charge of violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activities.",
      "The announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.",
      "Chambers, who has a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, was arrested in early April on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command.",
      "He has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The army\u2019s Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.",
      "Chambers\u2019 supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, was not written by him.",
      "He had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.",
      "Chambers\u2019 visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. It was not immediately clear whether the revocation will stand.",
      "\u201cThis case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\u201d the U.S. State Department said after Chambers\u2019 arrest. \u201cWe continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\u201d",
      "Thailand\u2019s l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law calls for three to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.",
      "That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the law."

      "Snakes making their way onto Shinkansen lines is rare, though it\u2019s not the first time this has happened. Last year, a 16-inch snake crawled its way into a passenger carriage on a train along the Tokyo-Nagoya line.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea\u00a0\u2014\u00a0South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court overturned on Thursday an earlier ruling that had cleared election frontrunner Lee Jae-myung of violating election law, throwing into doubt his eligibility to run for the presidency.",
      "Lee, the candidate of the liberal Democratic Party that controls parliament, leads opinion polls to win a snap presidential election  set off by the ouster of conservative former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his imposition of martial law.",
      "The election law violation case against\u00a0Lee\u00a0had been closely watched since a ruling that removes him from the ballot could\u00a0further\u00a0deepen divisions in society, after months of political turmoil that has hampered efforts to steer Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy through the choppy waters of U.S. tariffs.",
      "In March, an appeals court had\u00a0cleared\u00a0Lee\u00a0of violating the election law, but prosecutors had appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.",
      "Lee\u00a0is embroiled in\u00a0several criminal trials, but the election law case was\u00a0in the spotlight because if the Supreme Court\u00a0overturned\u00a0Lee\u2019s not guilty verdict and it is finalized, it would bar him from contesting elections for at least five years.",
      "The Supreme Court said that\u00a0Lee\u00a0violated election law by publicly stating false facts and ruled to send the case back to the appeals court.",
      "While the Supreme Court moved unusually fast to consider\u00a0Lee\u2019s election law case, it gave no deadline for the lower court, which usually takes months to revisit rulings and it was unclear if it would come before the June 3 election.",
      "Meanwhile, South Korea\u2019s acting leader, Han Duck-soo, resigned on Thursday in order to clear a path for him to join the race to become the country\u2019s permanent president. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok was expected to stand in as acting president\u00a0as required by law.",
      "Speculation had grown that\u00a0Han, 75, would decide to contest the election after opinion polls showed an increase in support for the experienced technocrat, who was thrust into the top post in December after Yoon\u2019s removal from office.",
      "Han was impeached less than two weeks into the role after clashing with lawmakers in the opposition-controlled parliament. South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court overturned that impeachment in March, restoring Han to the acting president position."
