      "The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row",
      "NEW YORK -- The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.",
      "\u201cI was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,\" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. \"I just feel like we\u2019ve seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Face,\u201d which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.",
      "Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.",
      "Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, \u201cHappy Face\u201d is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It\u2019s either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it\u2019s all about kicking in doors. I\u2019ve written on those shows and they\u2019re fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,\u201d Cacicio says.",
      "\u201cWhat is it like for the rest of the family when there\u2019s this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?\u201d",
      "Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cThe worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you\u2019re a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?\u201d",
      "Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, \u201cShattered Silence\u201d and the 2018 \"Happy Face\" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.",
      "Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: \u201cIf you want someone who\u2019s a straight-up journalist, who\u2019s just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,\u201d she told her. \u201cThere\u2019s also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that\u2019s asking some questions about true crime.\u201d",
      "Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives \u2014 Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.",
      "\u201cObviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn\u2019t talk about and it was something I didn\u2019t want my friends to know,\u201d says Cacicio.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that\u2019s what made her trust me \u2014 that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also \u201cHappy Face\u201d isn't that kind of show.",
      "\u201cThis is told from Melissa\u2019s point of view, and I think it\u2019s actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he shows emotions like a little boy who\u2019s trying to talk himself out of a whipping.\u201d",
      "Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.",
      "\u201cAre we obsessed with these stories because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?\u201d she asks. \u201cI read somewhere that it\u2019s an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re watching is worse than what\u2019s happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The trade organization that represents movie theater owners in the U.S. and abroad is getting a rebrand",
      "In hindsight, NATO was an unnecessarily confusing acronym for a trade organization representing movie theater owners. For 60 years, the National Association of Theatre Owners has promoted interests of movie theaters, from the biggest chains to the one screen mom and pop shops. They\u2019ve also regularly gotten mail and phone calls intended for the other NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
      "But the theater owner\u2019s organization is looking to the future, with a new name and a refocused mission. The group will now be known as Cinema United, president and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary told The Associated Press Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little complicated having the same name as a multinational military alliance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe felt that it was time to look at our name and do a rebrand.\u201d",
      "They wanted the new name to reflect the \u201cpassion and energy of the people that run theaters,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, and to put the focus back on the exhibitors and movie theaters. Cinema United represents more than 32,000\u202fmovie screens in the U.S. and more than 30,000 screens in 88 countries. Their job, O\u2019Leary explained, is to promote and support theatrical exhibition. Moviegoing, the new tagline reads, is their mission.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a challenging four or five years. But with each passing day, we put those challenges in the rearview mirror a little bit more. Our focus right now is on the future,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think that we stand on the precipice of the next great era of cinema.\u201d",
      "Just a few weeks ago, \u201cAnora\u201d filmmaker Sean Baker made his own case for theaters on the national stage. In accepting his best director Oscar, he used his time at the podium to make a \u201cbattle cry\u201d for the theatrical experience \u2013 for filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screen and for studios to keep releasing them there.",
      "\u201cPeople were ecstatic about it,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHe has earned the unyielding allegiance of theater owners all around the world for his strong support over the years, and certainly at the Oscars.\u201d",
      "Movie theaters big and small were hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 many closed and never re-opened. Last year, they also faced a depleted release calendar due to the Hollywood strikes. It\u2019s all resulted in a depleted domestic box office that has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. In 2024, the industry finished just over $8.7 billion, down 3.3% from 2023 and 23.5% from 2019.",
      "A fuller release schedule is expected this year, but currently the box-office total is down about 5% from where the industry was last year at this time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we not put too much emphasis on a single year like 2025. We need to constantly be building and growing and moving forward,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Despite challenges, it remains an all-ages and affordable entertainment pasttime. A recent study from the National Research Group said 76% of the American population ages 12 to 74 attended at least one movie in 2024.",
      "And though theater closures often make headlines, like the E Street Cinema in Washington D.C., where Cinema United is headquartered, there\u2019s also been a spate of investment and refurbishment in theaters around the country, some spearheaded by famous filmmakers and actors.",
      "Jason Reitman along with more than 30 directors including Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and Bradley Cooper last February acquired Westwood\u2019s Village Theater in Los Angeles, which dates back to 1931. Patrick Wilson also purchased and helped restore an historic theater in New Canaan, CT, joining big screen disciples like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino who have all invested in movie theaters.",
      "Last fall, the eight biggest theater chains in the U.S. and Canada announced that they planned to invest more than $2.2 billion to modernize 21,000 movie theater screens over the next three years. This includes anything from projectors, lighting and sound to features in the concessions area. But upgrades in theaters are nothing new, O\u2019Leary said, they\u2019re just helping to draw attention to it.",
      "\u201cThe entire membership reinvests in their theaters on a regular basis,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cPart of the reason we made that announcement was because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious to people that theater owners are constantly in the process of reinventing themselves and reinvesting.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes just over a week before some 6,000 movie theater employees from around the world convene in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon conference, which Cinema United hosts.",
      "All the major Hollywood studios, including The Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures and even Amazon/MGM will be making big, starry presentations on the main stage at Caesar\u2019s Palace \u2014 where executives and stars will show off new footage and trailers to make the case that they have the goods to get audiences in the theaters.",
      "NATO was coined in 1965, a merger of the nation\u2019s largest movie theater trade organizations: The Theater Owners of America, itself a product of a merger dating back to 1948, and the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors, which goes back to the 1920s.",
      "Those at Cinema United like to say that \"we\u2019re not a Hollywood industry. We\u2019re a Main Street industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the vast majority of our members are small businesses, so they feel the same pushes and pulls that other small businesses feel throughout the United States and around the world, O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe headquarters of our biggest members are not in Los Angeles or New York. They\u2019re in Knoxville, Dallas and Kansas.\"",

      "It's not just that soulful blast from Michael McDonald, marking his first time recording with the band in 45 years. Listen and you'll also hear founding member Pat Simmons and original vocalist Tom Johnston.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d \u2014 with the always-welcome addition of Mavis Staples \u2014 is a horn-and-slide-guitar slice of bluesy, wailing rock that's also a celebration of a band that has endured changes and re-formed with members now in their 70s.",
      "\u201cSomehow, here we are,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends throughout the years. Our kids have all grown up together and our kids have kind of kept us in contact even at times when we might have dropped off the radar for each other.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers, who formed in 1970 and initially broke up in 1982, have a packed 2025 planned: A European tour that leads to a North American one, the strong new album and inclusion in the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us ever even really thought we\u2019d still be on stage at this age doing this, much less together,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cThat we\u2019re still able to express ourselves artistically is something that\u2019s not lost on us.\u201d",
      "The North American tour kicks off in Detroit on Aug. 4 and heads to such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Toronto. The opening act will be The Coral Reefer Band.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d features 10 new songs sung by McDonald, Simmons and Johnston, who collaborated on writing the tracks and play on each other's tunes. Longtime collaborator John McFee also returned for the project.",
      "The album, out June 6, has something for everyone \u2014 honky-tonk, driving country, flirty Southern pop, moody folk and melodic rock. There are songs about New Orleans and Hawaii. Angels make the lyrics on two songs.",
      "\u201cOne of the strengths of our live show was the fact that you couldn\u2019t get bored with any one style of music because everything was kind of a different bag,\u201d says McDonald, who officially reunited with the band on tour in 2019. \u201cWe like to do that. You know, I think this album is hopefully no different in that respect.\u201d",
      "John Shanks, who produced the band's 2021 album \u201cLibert\u00e9,\u201d returned for \u201cWalk This Road,\u201d lending them his Los Angeles studio, with a writing room upstairs and a recording booth downstairs where each songwriter took turns cutting tracks.",
      "\u201cThe band, I think, presents all of us with an opportunity to do things that we might not do just as individual songwriters,\u201d says McDonald.",
      "While the Doobies have never been a concept band, the album explores seizing the moments, reflects on paths taken and coming to grips with the past.",
      "\u201cThis is a snapshot in time of where the band is and where the writers are,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe didn\u2019t consciously sit down and say, 'Well, we\u2019re going to try and do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "One track, \"Learn to Let Go,\" is an unrequited love song that's about letting go of things that hold you back, while \u201cSpeed of Pain\u201d is about how the worst things in life can become the best.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, it\u2019s just a situation where you have to lose it all. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve met over the years who have told me that going to jail was the best thing that ever happened to them,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cI think total defeat in this world is the great teacher.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers are already members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with tracks like \u201cTakin\u2019 It To the Streets,\u201d \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d and \u201cMinute By Minute\u201d \u2014 but shortly after the album comes out, they'll be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",

      "McDonald and Johnston both expressed a little surprise that they're still making music with the folks they worked with in their 20s and are still a draw on the road.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to visit all these places musically. It\u2019s fun to put that out in front of the crowd live. And to do an album now \u2014 I didn\u2019t picture doing this, but I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Johnston says.",

      "As CBS' parent company considers settlement of President Donald Trump's lawsuit against \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America\u2019s storied newsmagazine is pulling no punches in its coverage of the new administration",
      "NEW YORK -- As CBS corporate leaders ponder settling President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against the network's \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America's storied newsmagazine has produced some fast and hard-hitting stories critical of the new administration in every episode since Trump was inaugurated.",
      "The latest was Sunday, when CBS News helped pay for a performance featuring non-white middle and high school musicians who had won a contest and with it, the right to play with the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The original concert, however, was canceled because of Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Correspondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show's seven stories since Trump's inauguration, including Sunday's. He examined the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested \u201clong prison sentences\u201d for those working on the show.",
      "All came at a time when television's most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.",
      "\u201cThis may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,\u201d said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.",
      "Pelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.",
      "\u201cAnother week, another \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story trying to discredit Trump policies,\u201d Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X on Sunday night.",
      "Trump's lawsuit, coupled with a parallel Federal Communications Commission investigation, accuses \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of election interference for the way it edited Bill Whitaker's interview last fall with Trump's 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "Two sound bites, broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d depicted Harris giving different responses to Whitaker in a discussion about Israel. CBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.",
      "CBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay $16 million in December to end Trump's lawsuit against ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. Complicating matters is Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration.",
      "Many at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did nothing wrong. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologize as part of any prospective settlement.",
      "\u201cMy precious \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. \u201cI am so proud of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.\u201d",
      "Neither Owens nor Pelley would comment on whether the show is trying to deliver any sort of message about the lawsuit through its work. Bettag said he believed \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is motivated by the importance of the stories.",
      "What the show has done during the past two months is striking, said Bettag, now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe \u201860 Minutes\u2019 people are such committed journalists that they\u2019d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\"",
      "Some of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce. Pelley's March 2 report about Ukraine came only days after the White House confrontation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk's angry comment on his X social media platform came after Pelley's Feb. 16 story about the billionaire's role in the quick shutdown of the USAID office. \u201cThe world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families,\u201d Pelley said, noting that Musk collects \u201cbillions of taxpayer dollars\u201d for his SpaceX company.",
      "Hours later, Musk wrote on X: \u201c60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.\u201d",
      "Other news organizations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. Besides Pelley, he cited the news staff of the Washington Post at a time the newspaper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos, has shown more friendliness to Trump.",
      "Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story involved some elite high school students \u2014 each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent \u2014 who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.",
      "CBS worked with Equity Arc, an organization devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organize a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.",
      "Pelley called it the \u201cconcert that was not meant to be heard.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,\u201d he said. \u201cHere tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.\u201d",
      "Pelley's March 9 report, \u201cFiring the Watchdogs,\u201d was about Trump's efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies. He quoted Trump as saying the firings were standard for a new administration taking office. \u201cHe's wrong,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "His story about the U.S. Justice Department examined the resistance among some prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\u201cAs he continues to step up his attacks on President Donald Trump and the new administration, Pelley is elbowing aside all others to emerge as Trump's loudest TV critic,\u201d wrote Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner.",
      "In his stories, Pelley's deadpan voice and methodical style could not hide the sharpness of some observations. While narrating the story about USAID, Pelley noted that \u201cIt's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution.\"",

    "story": [
      "An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000",
      "PARIS -- An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000, offering a vibrant immersion in France's cosmopolitan capital and a history of anti-colonial, civil rights struggles.",
      "The \u201cBlack Paris\u201d exhibition features the works of about 150 major artists of African descent, many of whom have never or rarely been displayed in France before. Running from March 19 to June 30, it's one of the final shows before the museum closes for a five-year renovation later this year.",
      "\u00c9va Barois De Caevel, associate curator, said that the exhibition is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d with more than 300 paintings and sculptures by artists of various backgrounds.",
      "\u201cSome are African Americans, some are Caribbeans, some are Africans, and some are Afro-descendants,\u201d said Barois De Caevel, adding that the focus of the exhibit is not geography or race, but rather \u201cBlack consciousness,\u201d shaped by the history of slavery and experience of racism shared by Black artists.",
      "After World War II, many African American painters, musicians, and intellectuals flocked to Paris, seeking a sense of freedom that they couldn't find in the United States at the time. Barois De Caevel pointed out that for many, Paris represented a break from the racial segregation that they faced back home.",
      "\u201cMany enjoyed being free in the streets of Paris \u2014 being able to go out with white women, enter cafes, bars and restaurants, and be treated like white people,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut they were not fooled,\" she added, noting that African American writer James Baldwin \"wrote about this early on, that in France, racism is especially targeting Black Africans and Algerians, who were really extremely mistreated. So it\u2019s an ambivalent relationship with Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also shows how many African artists from French colonies \u2014 and later former colonies \u2014 came to Paris to join a political and intellectual movement fighting for civil rights and racial justice, while others from the Caribbean were supporting independentist movements, which were gaining strength there.",
      "Alicia Knock, curator of the exhibition, praised the ambitious scope of the show, which she described as \u201can incredible epic of decolonization,\u201d highlighting how Paris city served as both a \u201clab for Pan-Africanism,\u201d the movement that encouraged solidarity between peoples of African descent, and an \u201canti-colonial workshop.\u201d",
      "Visitors \u201cwill see how these artists contributed to rewriting the history of modernism and postmodernism,\u201d Knock said, and how they \u201dreframed abstraction and surrealism, and at the same time you will also see the Black solidarities that happened at the time.\u201d",
      "\"Many of these artists were not only creators, but also cultural ambassadors, teachers, poets, and philosophers,\u201d she added.",
      "For some coming from the U.S., Paris was also \u201ca gateway to Africa,\u201d Knock said, based on discussions she had with some of the artists' families: \"They told us that, in fact, they had come to Paris to go to Africa, and in the end they found Africa in Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also includes installations from four artists chosen to provide contemporary insights, including Shuck One, a Black graffiti and visual artist native of the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.",
      "In addition, the Pompidou Center has acquired around 40 of the show's artworks, which will remain part of the museum\u2019s collection.",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Knock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a baby step for many French institutions, French museums and French universities to start working on these artists, start collecting them, writing about them, preserving their works in their archives and hopefully dedicating a lot of solo shows to many of these artists, because they really deserve it.\"",

      "Both took a dip -- but only a dip.",
      "With JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers and a host of other standout players leading the way, attendance across the country was just short of last season's record numbers in women's hoops and still the second-highest ever.",
      "More networks showed more games on TV this season and ratings were strong heading into March Madness that starts this week. ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",
      "\u201cThere are great stars, great brands, we\u2019ve done more than we have done before and we\u2019re not alone in doing that,\u201d Fox Sports President of Insights and Analytics Mike Mulvihill said. \u201cThe 3-5-10 year trend clearly is an upward trend.\u201d",
      "While the network\u2019s overall ratings are down from last season\u2019s record mark that was due in large part to Clark being on Fox a lot, Mulvihill is happy with where they are.",
      "\u201cTo go from zero exposures a few years ago to 18 on our biggest platform speaks to the growth and interest in the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s growing confidence in this building that we can put it on broadcast and justify it. I love that we are able to put games on in primetime. It means something to the coaches and players.\u201d",

The game between Watkins\u2019 USC and Bueckers\u2019 UConn on Dec. 21 was shown in primetime after an NFL game and averaged 2.2 million viewers, peaking at nearly 3.8 million. That was the second-most watched women\u2019s game on the network behind only Clark\u2019s game last year when she set the NCAA scoring record.",

      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",
      "Women's basketball programming director Dan Margulis knows that the network had a perfect storm last season to achieve the record ratings that saw the women's championship game outdraw the men. Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at early rounds and everything growing going into it,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cCompared to two years ago, we see that growth.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just the championship game that drew huge numbers. A rematch between Reese and Clark in the Elite Eight game was massive as well.",
      "\u201cCertainly the floor has risen dramatically,\u201d said lead ESPN announcer Rebecca Lobo. \u201cThe expectation for this year\u2019s tournament, Final Four or national championship shouldn\u2019t be what we saw a year ago. Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",
      "While there isn't an undefeated team this year or a generational player like Clark on her last run, there is more parity in the sport.",
      "People aren\u2019t just watching on TV, but also showing up at games. The power conferences had strong attendance marks. The SEC led the way, setting numerous conference records, including total for its tournament and the mark in both the semis and the finals.",
      "The Big Ten had its second-highest average attendance in the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cGranted we get to see some of the best ones, but the energy was different throughout the country,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cThe South Carolina-LSU game on a Thursday night with 2,500 students has a different energy. The increase from students across the country has made for incredible environments.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has dismissed the charges against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Prosecutors informed the court Monday that he died Sunday",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\u201d an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

      "Born in Bel\u0153il, Belgium, in 1981, Dequenne had a performance streak from a young age. She studied drama at the Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Baudour.",
      "She became well-known in France after starring alongside Catherine Deneuve in \u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d in 2009, based on the true story of a woman who falsely claimed she was the victim of an antisemitic attack. Dequenne also portrayed police officer Laurence Renauld on the French series \u201cThe Missing.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she won the Un Certain Regard actress prize from Cannes for \u201cOur Children,\u201d a dark psychological drama inspired by the real story of a Belgian woman who killed her five children. She was also nominated for several C\u00e9sar Awards throughout her career, finally winning best supporting actress in 2021 for the romantic comedy \u201cLove Affair(s).\u201d",
      "Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the difficult role in \u201cOur Children,\u201d she said, \u201cFor my part I went home every weekend, and stayed with my family, which is a very safe place. Making a film like that is something that you have to survive.\u201d",
      "More recently, she co-starred in \u201cClose,\u201d Lukas Dhont\u2019s tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with \u201cRosetta.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it\u2019s very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with \u2018Rosetta,\u2019\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot. And that\u2019s the same for him.\u201d",
      "Dequenne returned to the festival again in 2024 for the 25th anniversary of \u201cRosetta.\u201d Her last film was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jardin\u2019s post-apocalyptic thriller \u201cSurvive,\u201d which came out earlier this year.",
      "While she loved taking on work in England, France and Belgium, she had little interest in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cI have been to Hollywood and had meetings, but really they don\u2019t do the kind of films I like to make. And everything is kind of boring, no?\u201d she said in the interview with The Guardian. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not a fun place, or at least not my kind of fun.\u201d",
      "She is survived by her husband, director and producer Michel Ferracci, and daughter, Milla Savarese.",

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A New Mexico court granted a temporary restraining order Monday against the release of certain records related to the investigation into the recent deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa.",
      "The order is in response to a request by Julia Peters, a representative for the couple's estate. She urged in a motion filed last week that the court seal records in the case to protect the family\u2019s right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.",

      "The order granted Monday lists any and all photographs and videos showing the couple's bodies and the interior of their home. Certain footage from the body cameras of the sheriff's deputies who responded to the home is included along with records from the state Office of the Medical Investigator.",

That brings its domestic total to $33.3 million and its global total to $90.5 million against a reported $118 million budget.",

      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",

      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. births rose slightly last year, but experts don't see it as evidence of reversing a long-term decline.",
      "A little over 3.6 million births were reported for 2024, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention preliminary data. That's 22,250 more than the final tally of 2023 U.S. births, which was released Tuesday.",
      "The 2024 total is likely to grow at least a little when the numbers are finalized, but another set of preliminary data shows overall birth rates rose only for one group of people: Hispanic women.",
      "The rise \u2014 less than 1% \u2014 may just be a small fluctuation in the middle of a broader trend, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who studies family demographics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be hesitant to read much into the 2023-24 increase, and certainly not as an indication of a reversal of the trend towards lower or declining U.S. fertility,\u201d Kohler said, adding that more analysis is needed to understand any changes that happened in birth patterns last year.",
      "U.S. births and birth rates have been falling for years. They dropped most years after the 2008-09 recession, aside from a 2014 uptick. They also dropped in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, then rose for two straight years after that, an increase experts partly attributed to pregnancies put off amid the pandemic.",
      "A 2% drop in 2023 put U.S. births at fewer than 3.6 million, the lowest one-year tally since 1979. Vermont had the lowest birth rate that year, and Utah had the highest, according to Tuesday's 86-page report on 2023 birth data.",
      "The report, based on a review of all the birth certificates filed that year, shows the average age of mothers at first birth has continued to rise, hitting 27 1/2 years. It was 21 1/2 in the early 1970s, before beginning a steady climb.",
      "Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but were rising for women in their 30s and 40s \u2014 a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But in 2023, birth rates fell for women in almost all age groups, include women in their early 40s.",
      "Preliminary birth rate data for 2024 shows a continued decrease among teenagers and women in their early 20s. But it also showed increases for women in their late 20s, due entirely to a rise in births to Hispanic women. Increases also were seen for women in their 30s, due to rises among Hispanic and white women, and those in their 40s, due to rises among white women.",

      "A new report identifies ways to create resilient water and wastewater systems in communities hardest hit by climate change",
      "Malynndra Tome was helping to map livestock ponds in the Navajo Nation when she saw something that inspired her to act. An elderly woman was filling milk jugs with water at the back of a gas station in the Native American reservation, where about 30% of people live without running water.",
      "\u201cHow can we be living in the United States of America \u2026 one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?\u201d asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation's largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles (69,930 square kilometers) in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.",
      "A report published Tuesday identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome\u2019s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology \u2014 all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,\u201d said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. \u201cIn spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.\u201d",
      "Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people\u2019s access to water.",
      "In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system. In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.",
      "Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country\u2019s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.",
      "An estimated 30% of the population in the Navajo Nation lives in homes that don\u2019t have running water, and many residents drive long distances to get water from public spigots, according to the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.",
      "Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report \u201ccomes at a very depressing moment where we're not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn't seem, for the next four years.\u201d",
      "The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.",
      "The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.",
      "The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida\u2019s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.",
      "The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. \u201cOur innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.\u201d",
      "Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.",
      "\u201cWater is a basic human right,\u201d said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources. \u201cAnd in order for people to live productively, to have healthy lives, I think water is a big part of that.\u201d",

      "Members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would hand over the company and up to $7 billion in cash in the latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "Purdue Pharma asked a bankruptcy judge late Tuesday to consider the latest version of its plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin, a deal that would have members of the Sackler family who own the company pay up to $7 billion.",
      "The filing is a milestone in a tumultuous legal saga that has gone on for more than five years.",
      "Under the deal the family members \u2014 estimated in documents from 2020 and 2021 to be worth about $11 billion \u2014 would give up ownership of the company in addition to contributing money over 15 years with the biggest payment up front.",
      "Family members resigned from Purdue's board, stopped receiving money from the company and ceased other involvement before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as it faced lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments, plus others.",
      "The new entity would be run by a board appointed by state governments, and its mission will be to abate the opioid crisis that has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The first wave of deadly overdoses were tied to OxyContin and other prescription drugs, and subsequent waves have involved first heroin and more recently illicit versions of fentanyl.",
      "This settlement plan was hammered out in months of mediation involving groups that sued Purdue, and nearly all of them are supporting it, according to mediator reports filed in court.",
      "Approval would take at least several more months.",
      "A previous version had bankruptcy court approval but was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court because it protected members of the Sackler family from civil lawsuits even though none of them filed for bankruptcy protection themselves.",
      "Under the new version, plaintiffs will have to opt in to get full shares of the settlement. If they do not, they can still sue Sackler family members, who agreed to put in about $1 billion more than under earlier plans. The Sacklers' cash contribution would depends in part on how many parties join the settlement and on the sale of foreign drug companies. Some of the money they put into the settlement is to be reserved to pay any judgments if they are sued and lose; but if that doesn't happen, it's to go into the main settlement.",
      "Members of the family have been cast as villains and have seen their name removed from art galleries and universities around the world because of their role in the privately held company. They continue to deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Other drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacy chains and others have already reached opioid lawsuit settlements worth about $50 billion, according to an Associated Press tally. Purdue's, which would also include about $900 million from company coffers, would be among the largest if finalized.",
      "The deals require most of the money be used to fight the opioid crisis.",
      "Purdue's is the only major one that also provides direct money for victims \u2014 potentially more than $850 million total in pools for people who became addicted, their families and babies born in withdrawal. That figure is more than in the previous incarnation.",
      "The deadline to apply for a piece of those funds passed years ago. In earlier versions, individuals were expected to receive between about $3,500 and $48,000. Families were split over the deal.",
      "Purdue would also provide millions of documents to a repository that would make them public. The company has also been producing a low-cost version of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati is hearing arguments in a lawsuit pitting a suburban Ohio school district\u2019s policy on preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati will hear arguments Wednesday in a legal dispute that pits a suburban Ohio school district's policy requiring use of students' preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Parents Defending Education, a national Christian organization, against the Olentangy Local School District in 2023 has captured broad national attention from groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Manhattan Institute. Ohio's solicitor general has asked to participate in oral arguments on behalf of 22 U.S. states that have interests in the case.",
      "A lower court rejected the group\u2019s arguments that the policies violated students\u2019 First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit affirmed that decision in July.",
      "The full court will reconsider that decision in a rare en banc hearing Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The lawsuit takes issue with overlapping district policies that prohibit the use of gender-related language that other students might deem insulting, dehumanizing, unwanted or offensive and call for the use of peers' \u201cpreferred pronouns.\u201d",
      "The district's electronic devices policy \u2014 which applies both on and off school time \u2014 prohibits transmitting \u201cdisruptive\u201d material or material that could be seen as harassing or disparaging other students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other categories.",
      "A separate antidiscrimination policy prohibits students from engaging in \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d during times when they're under the school's authority. That is defined as \u201cverbal or written comments, jokes, and slurs that are derogatory towards an individual or group based on one or more of the following characteristics: race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and transgender identity), disability, age, religion, ancestry, or genetic information.\u201d",
      "The district's code of conduct echoes many of the same themes a third time.",
      "Parents Defending Education, founded in 2021 amid the culture wars over schools\u2019 teachings on race, diversity and sexuality, argues that the policies compel students and parents who belong to their group to \u201caffirm an idea that gender is fluid\u201d in contradiction of their religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cThese students have views that the District disfavors,\u201d the group wrote in a court filing. \u201cSpecifically, they believe that people are either male or female, that biological sex is immutable, and that sex does not change based on someone\u2019s internal feelings. Accordingly, they \u2018d(o) not want to be forced to \u2018affirm\u2019 that a biologically female classmate is actually a male \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 or that a classmate is \u2019nonbinary' and neither male nor female.\u201d",
      "The group argues that the policies unconstitutionally compel \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d speech by forcing students who believe in only two genders to use pronouns that suggest otherwise. They say that violates the First Amendment's guarantees to free speech and similar protections contained in the 14th Amendment, particularly since students are subject to punishment for violating the policies.",
      "Parents Defending Education further challenges the electronic devices policy for applying outside school hours and off school property. The ACLU has sided with the parents' group on this point, arguing the district's policies are overbroad.",
      "Olentangy Local School District outside Columbus, one of the state's largest districts, maintains the policies protect students against abuse and harassment and asserts that Parents Defending Education represents \u201cChristian, cisgender\u201d students \"seeking dispensation under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to harass other students based on their gender identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not illegal immigrants subject to deportation. They are not gay soldiers under Don't Ask Don't Tell. They're not African Americans in the Jim Crow south. They've not been systematically oppressed,\" the district's lawyers told the lower court. \"They're members of the majority who want to \u2014 under the guise of the First Amendment \u2014 openly voice their opposition to an historically maligned minority group, transgendered people.\u201d",
      "Olentangy argues that Parents Defending Education has failed to provide evidence of injury \u2014 as the lawsuit was filed before disciplinary action had been brought against any student. The district also says that its policies leave open other options for students who don't wish to use someone's preferred pronouns. That includes calling the person by their first name, using a gender-neutral pronoun or simply not referring to them at all.",
      "The availability of such options, an argument against the policies unconstitutionally compelling students to say certain things, played a role in the three-judge panel's 2-1 ruling in favor of the district last summer.",

      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of employees returned to the Food and Drug Administration's headquarters Monday to find overflowing parking lots, long security lines and makeshift office spaces without chairs and other basic supplies.",
      "The FDA is the latest agency scrambling to meet the Trump administration\u2019s return-to-office mandate, part of a flurry of actions \u2014 including firings and buyouts \u2014 intended to radically shrink the federal workforce. Monday was the first day that all rank-and-file FDA staffers were required to report to offices, including the agency\u2019s 130-acre campus just outside Washington.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with more than a half-dozen FDA staffers who described long lines to park and clear security, followed by hours of hunting for space and supplies in offices that were not designed to accommodate the agency\u2019s full workforce. The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.",
      "One staffer described \u201cchaos and lost work hours\" for commuting, security lines and shuffled office space.",
      "About half the FDA\u2019s 20,000 scientists, attorneys, inspectors and support staff report to the agency\u2019s main campus in White Oak, Maryland, which until the late 1990s was a naval weapons testing facility.",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice a decade earlier. Most employees had the option to work from home at least two days a week \u2014 flexibility that was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting highly trained experts who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "By 7:30 a.m., many on-campus parking lots were full, with cars parked along side streets, according to employees. Some workers reported waiting up to one hour to clear security checkpoints, and photos viewed by the AP showed lines of employees winding out doorways, along sidewalks and around corners.",
      "Once inside, employees confronted broken desks, missing chairs and locked offices for which they didn\u2019t have keys.",
      "\u201cAll of the staff is definitely bending over backwards to make an impossible situation work and get their work done,\u201d said one employee.",

      "\u201cPeople are looting chairs from conference rooms and other buildings,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cWe have no supplies. People are hunting around all of the buildings on campus for pads of paper and other basics.\u201d",
      "When employees did get situated, many shared cramped spaces with people from different divisions and teams, making it difficult to hold calls and meetings. Photos shared with the AP show folding chairs and tables setup in hallways and lobbies.",

      "All the employees told the AP that they brought their own drinking water Monday. That\u2019s due to a monthslong issue involving Legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease, which was detected at several FDA buildings. The General Service Administration, which oversees federal buildings, has been working on the issue since last summer.",
      "FDA staff received an email earlier this month that all water is safe to drink, but it did not detail the latest testing results or corrective actions taken.",
      "Anthony Lee, who represents the local chapter of the federal union for FDA employees, said the agency has not granted the group's request for a meeting on the issue.",
      "Asked about the water, one staffer said: \u201cHonestly, none of us have tried it. After months of Legionella warnings, it\u2019s not very inviting.\"",

      "Aid agencies distributing U.S. food aid in Ethiopia's war-affected Tigray region say they have had to stop feeding millions of people because of the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign aid",
      "MEKELE, Ethiopia -- As a displaced person in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region, 76-year-old Haile Tsege is no stranger to hunger.",
      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",
      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination. The U.S. Embassy didn't respond to questions.",
      "Emergency food was exempted from President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, signed on his first day in office, suspending foreign aid during a 90-day review amid the administration's allegations of waste.",
      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",
      "In 2024, child malnutrition stood at 21% in some areas, according to a survey reviewed by The Associated Press \u2014 far above the World Health Organization\u2019s threshold of 15% at which a situation is classified as an emergency.",
      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",
      "\u201cThis sudden disruption is having a huge impact on the healing of traumatized people,\u201d said Yohannes Fisseha, a CVT manager.",
      "Major projects to support people living with HIV, improve access to life-saving nutrition services and improve relations between war-affected communities have also been cut off, said Yirga Gebregziabher, the Tigray branch manager of an Ethiopian organization called OSSHD, which helped implement the projects.",
      "The organization has been forced to fire dozens of expert staff.",
      "\u201cOur picture of America was as a protector of rights, a positive force in the world,\u201d Yigra said. \u201cThat image has now been broken. If there was a process, maybe the shock would have been less. But there was no consultation, no engagement.\u201d",

The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",

Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",

      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",

Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states.",

      "Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would \u201creclaim\u201d the Panama Canal. Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino accused him of lying.",
      "Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong's laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating.",
      "Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee\u2019s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference.",
      "The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports.",
      "The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The transaction requires approval by Panama\u2019s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China.",
      "Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison's operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. \u201creclaiming\u201d of the canal, it says.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",
      "Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.",

      "The central Dutch city of Utrecht has installed a \u201cfish doorbell\u201d that allows denizens of the internet to give a helping hand to denizens of the deep in their springtime swim to shallow spawning grounds",
      "UTRECHT, Netherlands -- The central Dutch city of Utrecht has installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets viewers of an online livestream alert authorities to fish being held up as they make their springtime migration to shallow spawning grounds.",
      "The idea is simple: An underwater camera at Utrecht's Weerdsluis lock sends live footage to a website. When somebody watching the site sees a fish, they can click a button that sends a screenshot to organizers. When they see enough fish, they alert a water worker who opens the lock to let the fish swim through.",
      "Now in its fifth year, the site has attracted millions of viewers from around the world with its quirky mix of slow TV and ecological activism.",
      "Much of the time, the screen is just a murky green with occasional bubbles, but sometimes a fish swims past. As the water warms up, more fish show up.",
      "Without the help, native freshwater fish like bream, pike and bass can become backed up behind the lock and form easy prey for predators in the spring, when the lock is rarely opened for passing boats.",
      "The bell is the brainchild of ecologist and concept developer Mark van Heukelum. He's been happily surprised at the response, with millions of people from around the world tuning in over the years.",
      "\u201cI guess the combination of a good cause, a beautiful story and just a simple idea generates all this attention,\" he said.",
      "Anna Nijs, an ecologist with Utrecht municipality, was also amazed at the popularity of the concept around the world.",
      "\u201cWe get a lot of fan mail from people who think it\u2019s slow TV and they find it relaxing,\" said Nijs. Besides, \u201cthey appreciate that they can actually do something to help.\u201d",

      "Mexico City lawmakers have voted to ban violent bullfighting in the capital",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico City lawmakers on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to ban violent bullfighting, triggering outrage from aficionados and celebration from animal rights advocates.",
      "The legislation, approved by a 61-1 vote, prohibits the killing of bulls and the use of sharp objects that could injure the animals. It also sets time limits on how long bulls could be in the ring, all part of an initiative dubbed \u201cbullfighting without violence.\u201d",
      "The decision sparked angry protests from bullfighting supporters and matadors, some of whom tried to breach a police barricade at the local Congress. Some carried signs that read \u201cBeing a fan of la fiesta brava (bullfighting) is not a crime, it\u2019s a point of pride.\u201d",
      "Animal rights protesters celebrated, and were joined by Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada of the ruling Morena party, who said the decision will help the Mexican capital become a place \u201cthat respects the rights of animals and that will not tolerate them being subjected to abuse or violence.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s vote appeared to be an attempt to broker a compromise between two warring sides of the debate after years of back-and-forth about the practice.",
      "Bullfighting has long been considered a tradition and a pastime in Latin American nations, but has come under criticism for animal cruelty because bulls are often killed at the end of the fight. Animal rights groups say that approximately 180,000 bulls are killed every year in bullfighting worldwide.",
      "The tradition, which has long drawn big crowds to arenas across Mexico, was dealt a blow when a judge in Mexico City banned the practice in June 2022, shutting down an arena that has been billed as the world\u2019s largest bullfighting ring. The judge ruled that bullfights violated city residents' rights to a healthy environment free from violence.",
      "While animal rights advocates celebrated it as a victory, and a step toward ending the bloody tradition, bullfighters said it dealt an economic blow to the city. The National Association of Breeders of Fighting Bulls in Mexico says bullfighting generates 80,000 direct jobs, and 146,000 indirect jobs across the country.",
      "In 2023, Mexico's Supreme Court overturned the ban without explanation, allowing bullfighting arenas to be flooded once again with fans of the so-called \u201cfiesta brava.\"",

Italian winemakers, whose exports to the U.S. last year grew to 2 billion euros, are among those bracing for threatened tariffs of up to 200% should the EU tariffs take effect on April 1.",

The project has been stalled after Italian courts refused to approve deportation proceedings, which has been referred to the EU Court of Justice.",
      "\u201cI hope that the court will avoid the risk of compromising the repatriation policies not only of Italy, but all EU member states,'' she said, adding that it would \u201dundermine the very stability of Europe.\"",

      "Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence agency launched a search for its next chief on Tuesday, and the current officeholder has suggested he\u2019d like his replacement to be a woman. Although Judi Dench played M, the fictional head of MI6, in seven Bond thrillers starting in the 1990s, the real-life agency has not had a woman chief in its 116-year history.",
      "Richard Moore, the current C \u2014 as the real-life MI6 chief is known \u2014 wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller between 2002 and 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fits the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to shed its image as the least diverse of the agencies, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university.",
      "The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Moore apologized on behalf of MI6 for its treatment of LGBT staff and aspiring agents who were fired or denied jobs because of their sexuality. Gay people were barred from working for the agency until 1991.",
      "Moore said in a 2023 speech that he wanted MI6 to \u201cbetter represent the country we serve.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiversity brings greater creativity, better problem-solving,\u201d he said.",
      "In posts on X last week to mark International Women\u2019s Day, Moore said: \u201cNo one gets a job in MI6 except on merit. But we men, as allies, can help our female colleagues achieve the success their talent deserves. We have yet to have a woman as Chief so there\u2019s still a glass ceiling to shatter.\u201d",
      "Moore, appointed in 2020, has led MI6 through the COVID pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. He has opened the secretive agency ever-so-slightly to media scrutiny, making public speeches and embracing social media.",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing Moore\u2019s replacement takes place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Chris Wormald, writing to government departments on Tuesday asking them to put forward candidates.",
      "Applicants may come from among three MI6 directors-general who report to Moore, all of whom are women. That includes the agency\u2019s head of operations and its technology chief \u2013 the real-life equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "Applicants also could come from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "An announcement of the choice is likely in the summer, with the new chief taking up their post in the fall.",

      "Germany\u2019s would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, asked lawmakers Tuesday to loosen the nation's strict debt rules to enable higher defense spending as doubts mount about the strength of the trans-Atlantic alliance, and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure, financed by large-scale borrowing.",
      "Merz faced a major test in the outgoing parliament, which met for a final time to vote on the plans as his center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes will be needed to get enough support.",
      "The package would exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the stagnant economy \u2014 Europe's biggest \u2014 to growth.",
      "At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.",
      "The plans amount to an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to the \u201cdebt brake.\u201d The Social Democrats and Greens had long argued for a reform of the borrowing rules.",
      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",
      "Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \u201c\u2018whatever it takes\u2019 must also go for our defense now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, he pointed to the danger from Russian President Vladimir \u201cPutin's war of aggression against Europe \u2014 it is a war against Europe and not just a war against Ukraine's territorial integrity.\u201d He pointed to suspected Russian sabotage and disinformation in Europe.",
      "Merz said the prospective German government's move should be \u201cthe first step toward a new European defense community,\u201d which could include countries outside the European Union such as Britain and Norway.",
      "He acknowledged that many are struggling to digest the wider spending plans but argued that \u201cthey open prospects for our country that, in the times we are living in, are urgently needed.\u201d",
      "The package was brought to the old parliament \u2014 not the newly elected one, which will hold its first session March 25 \u2014 because parties that were unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "\u201cA politician's greatest asset is credibility and with this embarrassing action, dear Mr. Merz, you have already squandered yours completely,\u201d Alternative for Germany co-leader Tino Chrupalla said. \u201cVoters feel cheated by you, and rightly.\u201d",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

      "Not everything is being cut. The overhaul also includes an above-inflation increase to universal credit, one of the most common welfare benefits. Kendall said 1 billion pounds will be spent to \"tear down barriers to work,\u201d including new rules allowing welfare recipients to try out paid jobs without losing their benefits.",
      "The government claims a lack of support towards employment is trapping sick and disabled people in economic inactivity. Kendall said that \u201cin most comparable countries\u201d spending on sickness and disability benefits \u201cis either stable or falling \u2013 whilst ours continues to inexorably rise.\u201d",
      "The Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than 100 charities and organizations, said the \u201ccruel\u201d changes \u201cwill largely hit those who are unable to work and rely on these benefits to survive.\u201d",
      "Sarah Hughes, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said the cuts would make it harder for people to get support and \u201cwill only serve to deepen the nation\u2019s mental health crisis.\u201d",

      "Tuesday\u2019s welfare announcement followed weeks of speculation about how deep the cuts would be.",

      "Kendall said she understood \u201cthe worry and anxiety.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I hope I\u2019ve made it clear to the House today, I don\u2019t start from a position of being tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI start by precisely from a position of compassion.\u201d",

      "Pope Francis has said in a letter to an Italian newspaper that his lengthy illness has helped make \u201cmore lucid\u201d to him the absurdity of war and the power of words to shape the truth and facts",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis said in a letter published Tuesday that his lengthy illness has helped make \u201cmore lucid\u201d to him the absurdity of war, as his top deputy shot down any suggestion of resignation and plans progressed for an April 8 meeting with Britain's King Charles III.",
      "Italian daily Corriere della Sera published a letter to the editor from Francis, signed and dated March 14 from Rome's Gemelli hospital where the 88-year-old pontiff has been treated since Feb. 14 for a complex lung infection and double pneumonia.",
      "In it, Francis renewed his call for diplomacy and international organizations to find a \u201cnew vitality and credibility.\u201d And he said that his own illness had also helped make some things clearer to him, including the \u201cabsurdity of war.\u201d",
      "\u201cHuman fragility has the power to make us more lucid about what endures and what passes, what brings life and what kills,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Responding to a letter from the newspaper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Luciano Fontana, Francis also urged him and all those in the media to \u201cfeel the full importance of words.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are never just words: they are facts that shape human environments. They can connect or divide, serve the truth or use it for other ends,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must disarm words, to disarm minds and disarm the Earth.\u201d",
      "The letter was published as Francis registered slight improvements in his treatment and as the Vatican No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, shot down any suggestion the pope might resign.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely no,\u201d Parolin told journalists on Monday. Parolin has visited Francis twice during his hospitalization, most recently March 2, and said he found Francis better then than his first visit Feb. 25.",
      "Francis is now able to spend some time during the day off high flows of oxygen and use just ordinary supplemental oxygen delivered by a nasal tube, the Holy See press office said. Doctors are also trying to cut back on the amount of time he uses a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night, to force his lungs to work more.",
      "While those amount to \u201cslight improvements,\u201d the Vatican isn\u2019t yet providing any timetable on when he might be released. That said, Buckingham Palace announced Monday that King Charles III was scheduled to meet with Francis on April 8 at the Vatican.",
      "Such state visits are always closely organized with Parolin's office, suggesting that the Holy See believed the pope would be back home by then, barring any setbacks.",
      "The developments came as the Vatican released some details on the first photograph of Francis released since his hospitalization. The image, taken Sunday from behind, showed Francis sitting in his wheelchair in his private chapel in prayer without any sign of nasal tubes.",
      "The photo, showing Francis wearing a Lenten purple stole, followed an audio message Francis recorded March 6 in which he thanked people for their prayers, his voice soft and labored.",
      "Together, they suggested Francis is very much controlling how the public follows his illness to prevent it from turning into a spectacle. While many in the Vatican have held up St. John Paul II\u2019s long and public battle with Parkinson\u2019s disease and other ailments as a humble sign of his willingness to show his frailties, others criticized it as excessive and glorifying sickness.",
      "The image certainly reassured some well-wishers who came to Gemelli to pray for Francis, who is recovering in the 10th floor papal suite reserved for popes.",
      "\u201cAfter a month of hospitalization, finally a photo that can assure us that his health conditions are better,\u201d said the Rev. Enrico Antonio, a priest from Pescara.",
      "At the Vatican, Sister Mary, a nun from Kenya, said she thought \u201che looks great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe situation was very critical. But now seeing the photo, it makes me smile. It makes me feel better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me even feel safer that the church is still going on, that our pope can come back to us.\u201d",
      "But Benedetta Flagiello of Naples, who was visiting her sister who is a patient at Gemelli, wondered if the photo was even real.",
      "\u201cBecause if the pope can sit for a moment without a mask, without anything, why didn\u2019t he look out the window on the 10th floor to be seen by everyone?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf you remember our old pope (John Paul II), he couldn\u2019t speak up, but he showed up.\u201d",

      "The outgoing parliament is set to meet for a final time to vote on the plans as Merz's center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans will need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution.

      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",

      "The package is being brought to the old parliament \u2014 rather than the newly elected one, which will hold its first session on March 25 \u2014 because parties that are unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union government ministers on Tuesday debated ways to keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet over the weekend.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started broadcasting during the Cold War. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.",
      "Sweden\u2019s European Affairs Minister Jessica Rozencrantz insisted on the need to ensure that \u201cRadio Free Europe really continues to be an important voice for freedom and democracy, especially in those places where it is most needed.\u201d",
      "\u201cSweden encourages all countries and the (European) Commission to really look into what we can do in terms of financing, to make sure that we continue to have a strong Radio Free Europe,\u201d she told reporters in Brussels before the meeting.",
      "In a post on social media, Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said that the cut in funding puts \"independent journalism at serious risk in regions where the free press is silenced, from Russia and Belarus to Iran and Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Prevot warned that if the network \u201cdisappears, disinformation and propaganda will fill the void. That would a direct win for those who seek to undermine democracy. Europe cannot let that happen.\u201d",
      "The outlet got caught up as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming.",
      "\u201cThe cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s grant agreement would be a massive gift to America\u2019s enemies,\u201d the network\u2019s president and CEO, Stephen Capus, said in a statement in reaction to the move.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, is trying to establish what impact the cuts will have on U.S.-funded media working in Europe and how it might be able to help plug any gaps.",
      "\u201cWe know how important it is, the access to free and fair information,\u201d EU Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters after the meeting. But he added that Radio Free Europe \u201cis not unfortunately the only one of the projects which was cut.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are doing (a) comprehensive assessment on where the financial support from the U.S. was stopped,\u201d he said, to work out \u201chow can we help, what we can do.\u201d",

      "\u201cComing from the other side of the Iron Curtain, actually it was (from) the radio that we got a lot of information,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it has been a beacon of democracy, very valuable in this regard.\u201d",
      "But Kallas said that finding \u201cfunding to fill the void that the U.S. is leaving\u201d wouldn't be easy. \u201cThe answer to that question is not automatically, because we have a lot of organizations who are coming with the same request,\u201d she said.",
      "The Czech Republic, which has hosted Radio Free Europe for a quarter-century although its corporate headquarters is in Washington, is leading the push to keep the network alive. Kallas said that \u201cthere was really a push from the foreign ministers to discuss this and find the way.\u201d",

      "There has been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.",
      "\u201cTesla is an easy target,\u201d said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \u201cThey\u2019re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\u201d",

An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.",
      "\u201cThe statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\u201d the agent wrote.",
      "A number of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.",
      "An Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \u201cresist\u201d was also painted in red across the building\u2019s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\u201cWas this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\u201d Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \u201cNone of those factors are lost on us.\u201d",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Trump\u2019s adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.",
      "Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, saying \u201cat least some of it is organized and paid for\u201d by \u201cleftwing organizations in America, funded by leftwing billionaires, essentially.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \u201cMusk Or Us\u201d protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \u201cit explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\u201d",
      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle\u2019s new stigma, and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,\u201d or \u201cI just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\u201d",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla\u2019s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of the administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump's political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \u201cdomestic terror,\u201d and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she\u2019d opened an investigation \u201cto see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\u201d",

      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\u201cI\u2019s not the type of act that I would prioritize,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cNot right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\u201d",
      "Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.",
      "\u201cHate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that\u2019s fine and dandy, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify ruining somebody\u2019s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There\u2019s other ways to get your voice heard that\u2019s more effective.\u201d",

      "Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors seeking to convert to new, lower-carbon emission systems say they are finding federal funding they were counting on for the work is frozen or unavailable in the wake of sweeping budget cuts t...",
      "BREMEN, Maine -- Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors looking to switch to new, lower-carbon emission systems say the federal funding they relied on for this work is either frozen or unavailable due to significant budget cuts promoted by President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The changes are designed to replace old diesel-burning engines and outdated at-sea cooling systems and are touted by environmentalists as a way to reduce seafood's carbon footprint. Salmon harvesters in Washington state, scallop distributors in Maine and halibut fishermen in Alaska are among those who told The Associated Press their federal commitments for projects like new boat engines and refrigeration systems have been rescinded or are under review.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty. This is not a business-friendly environment,\u201d said Togue Brawn, a Maine seafood distributor who said she is out tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIf they want to make America great again, then honor your word and tell people what's going on.\"",
      "Decarbonization of the fishing fleet has been a target of environmental activists in recent years. One study published in the  Marine Policy journal states that more than 200 million tons of carbon dioxide were released via fishing in 2016.",
      "That is far less than agriculture, but still a significant piece of the worldwide emissions puzzle. With Earth experiencing worsening storms and its hottest year on record in 2024, reducing the burning of fossil fuels across different industry sectors is critical to fighting climate change, scientists have said.",
      "But climate-friendly projects often cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, leading fishermen to seek U.S. Department of Agriculture or Environmental Protection Agency funds to cover some costs. DOGE, a commission assembled to cut federal spending, has targeted both agencies for cutbacks.",
      "That has left fishermen like Robert Buchmayr of Seattle on the hook for huge bills. Buchmayr said he is nearing completion of a refrigeration project for a salmon boat and was counting on a $45,000 USDA grant to pay for a chunk of it. The agency told him last month the funding is on hold until further notice, he said.",
      "\u201cI'm scrambling, where does the money come from. I was counting on the grant,\u201d Buchmayr said. \u201cI was under the impression that if you got a grant from the United States, it was a commitment. Nothing in the letter was saying, 'Yes, we'll guarantee you the funds depending on who is elected.'\u201d",
      "The full extent of the cuts is unclear, and fishermen affected by them described the situation as chaotic and confusing.",
      "Representatives for the USDA and EPA did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press about the value of the cuts and whether they were permanent. Dan Smith, USDA Rural Development's state energy director for Alaska, said updates about some grants could arrive in April.",
      "Numerous fishermen, commercial fishing groups and advocates for working waterfronts told The Associated Press they learned about the changed status of their grant money in February and March. Some were told the money would not be coming and others were told the funds were frozen while they were subject to a review.",
      "Many prospective grant recipients said they have had difficulty getting updates from the agencies. The lack of certainty has fishermen worried and seeking answers, said Sarah Schumann, a Rhode Island fisherman and director of the Fishery Friendly Climate Action Campaign, a fishermen-led network that works on climate issues.",
      "\u201cThey've started contacting me in the last couple of weeks because they've had the plug pulled on money that was already committed,\u201d Schumann said. \u201cIf they miss a season they could go out of business.\u201d",
      "In Homer, Alaska, Lacey Velsko of Kaia Fisheries was excited for her decarbonization project, which she said hinged on hundreds of thousands of dollars via a USDA grant to improve a refrigeration system on one of her boats. The recently completed project burns less fuel and yields a higher quality project for the company, which fishes for halibut, Pacific cod and other fish, she said.",
      "But, now the company is told the money is unavailable, leaving a huge cost to bear, Velsko said.",
      "\u201cOf course we think it was unfair that we signed a contract and were told we would be funded and now we\u2019re not funded. If six months down the road we\u2019re still not funded I don\u2019t know what avenue to take,\u201d she said.",
      "The funding cuts have also hurt seafood processors and distributors, such as Brawn in Bremen, Maine. Brawn said she received a little more than half of a USDA grant of about $350,000 before learning the rest might not arrive.",
      "Brawn received the grant for Dayboat Blue, a project that uses a membership-based model to get Maine seafood to nationwide customers while reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and packaging.",
      "\u201cThis model can really help fishermen, it can help consumers, it can help communities,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cWhat it's going to do is it's going to stop the program.\u201d",
      "The confusion on the waterfront is another example of the bumpy rollout of government cutbacks under Trump. The Trump administration halted its firings of hundreds of federal employees who worked on nuclear weapons programs last month. It also moved to rehire medical device, food safety and other workers lost to mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration. New tariffs on key trading partners have also been chaotic.",
      "In Bellingham, Washington, EPA funding was paused for five engine replacement projects split between three companies, said Dan Tucker, executive director of the Working Waterfront Coalition of Whatcom County. He said the uncertainty about funding has made it difficult for fishermen to move ahead with projects that will ultimately benefit their businesses and the community at large.",
      "\u201cA lot of the small guys are like, 'Well, I really want to help out with climate change but I can't afford it,'\u201d Tucker said.",

      "In his place, the three appointed Kenneth Jackson, an administrator with the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the lawsuit.",
      "DOGE staff tried multiple times to access the building Monday before successfully getting in, partly with police assistance. The lawsuit says the institute's lawyer told DOGE representatives multiple times that the executive branch has no authority over the nonprofit.",

      "In a federal court filing late Tuesday, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said Unilever informed its board on March 3 that it was removing and replacing Ben & Jerry\u2019s CEO David Stever. Ben & Jerry\u2019s said that violated its merger agreement with Unilever, which states that any decisions regarding a CEO\u2019s removal must come after a consultation with an advisory committee from Ben & Jerry\u2019s board.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with London-based Unilever on Wednesday.",
      "Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry\u2019s in 2000 for $326 million. At the time, Ben & Jerry\u2019s said the partnership would help the progressive Vermont-based ice cream company expand its social mission.",
      "But lately, the marriage hasn\u2019t been a happy one. In 2021, Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop serving Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli business to a local company that said it would sell Ben & Jerry's under its Hebrew and Arabic name throughout Israel and the West Bank.",

    "story": [
      "A hair loss drug that first gained popularity in the 1990s is seeing a resurgence of interest",
      "WASHINGTON -- The latest trend in treating hair loss may sound familiar \u2014 essentially, it's a repurposed drug first popularized in the 1990s.",
      "Back then, TV viewers were inundated with ads for Rogaine, a sticky topical solution that could help treat thinning hair when applied to the scalp.",
      "Now dermatologists are increasingly prescribing the drug, known generically as minoxidil, in low-dose pills to help men and women maintain or regrow hair.",
      "The practice follows a handful of recent studies suggesting the ingredient works as well \u2014 and possibly better \u2014 when swallowed, rather than applied to hair follicles on the head. Telehealth companies are also driving new demand by offering a quick, easy way to get a prescription and have the pills shipped directly to customers' doors.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the drug:",
      "Minoxidil was originally developed as a pill to treat high blood pressure in the 1970s. Researchers noticed that some patients taking it experienced increased hair growth as a side effect.",
      "Rogaine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1988, the first drug to win the agency\u2019s endorsement for male pattern baldness. Studies showed that men on the medication, which was applied directly to the scalp, had a slower rate of hair loss and, in some cases, regrew hair.",
      "Starting in 1991, a lower dose was approved for women and the brand was aggressively marketed as an over-the-counter medication on TV and in print.",
      "The drug\u2019s ability to slow hair loss is likely related to its effect on blood circulation, according to experts.",
      "\u201cBy increasing blood flow to the scalp it signals hairs to stay in their grow phase for longer,\u201d said Dr. Adam Friedman, chair of dermatology at George Washington University. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep those hairs in that growth phase as long as possible.\u201d",
      "A recent consensus paper by more than 40 U.S. and international dermatologists concluded that minoxidil pills are effective and often more convenient and affordable than the liquid formulation.",
      "There's little research comparing the two forms of minoxidil, but many dermatologists believe the drug works better as a pill.",
      "At a chemical level, minoxidil is absorbed more directly when digested in the gut than when applied to the hairline. It\u2019s also more convenient, with patients taking the drug by mouth once a day, instead of applying the liquid once or twice daily using a dropper.",
      "\u201cAs you can imagine, that can be rather onerous,\u201d said Dr. Susan Taylor of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAlthough people often enthusiastically begin therapy\u2014 and even see results \u2014 after a while there are many who drop off.\u201d",
      "The doses prescribed for oral use are also very low. Dermatologists often direct men to take one half of the lowest-dose pill; women may only need a quarter of a pill.",
      "Those low doses can also reduce the chances for side effects, which can include dizziness, rapid heartbeat and swollen legs. The drug isn\u2019t recommended for people with a history of heart issues or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
      "The only other FDA-approved medication for hair loss is finasteride, sold under the brand name Propecia, a drug that blocks a byproduct of testosterone that triggers hair loss in men. That drug is generally considered more effective than minoxidil, but it can occasionally cause troubling sexual side effects, including erectile dysfunction. For optimal results, some dermatologists prescribe the two drugs in combination.",
      "In short, because there\u2019s very little money to be made.",
      "Minoxidil's patent has expired and it is now available as a low-cost generic medication. That means drugmakers have little financial incentive to spend millions on the new studies that would be needed to win FDA approval for hair loss.",
      "\u201cFor a drug like oral minoxidil \u2014 which is as old as dirt at this point \u2014 there are no reasons to do that,\u201d said Friedman. Like other dermatologists, Friedman gives hair-loss patients a prescription for the pills intended to treat blood pressure, a practice known as off-label prescribing.",
      "The upside for patients is that minoxidil is extremely affordable, with some pharmacies offering a month\u2019s supply for less than $5.",
      "\u201cNot a single patient has complained to me about the cost of this medication, which is extremely rare,\u201d said Dr. Luiz Garza of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The vast majority of doctors prescribing minoxidil for hair loss are dermatologists, who often turn to older drugs off-label for various hair and skin conditions.",
      "A survey of U.S. dermatologists published last year found 80% reported prescribing oral minoxidil. But with only about 12,000 dermatologists in the U.S., some patients may have trouble finding a provider.",
      "Telehealth providers like Hims and Ro say they are helping fill the gap. The companies' business model offers patients quick access to the medications they are seeking, often after simply filling out a questionnaire about their medical history, medications and treatment goals. The information is reviewed by a health provider who can quickly approve a prescription, assuming there are no red flags.",
      "Hims and Ro each say that their providers won't prescribe minoxidil for patients who have complicating health conditions or prescriptions that could negatively interact with the drug. In some cases, patients may be referred for an office visit.",
      "Many dermatologists say patients are better served by an in-person appointment, where a doctor will usually take a blood pressure reading, evaluate medical history, prescriptions and discuss the drug's side effects.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a proponent of going to an online service,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI recommend seeing your board-certified dermatologist who\u2019s trained, who knows the data and can evaluate all of you.\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that a vow by Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin not to attack energy infrastructure was \u201cvery much at odds with reality\u201d following an overnight barrage of drone strikes across the country.",
      "Zelenskyy said that he would speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later in the day and expected to hear more about the American leader's phone call with Putin about a ceasefire and to discuss the next steps to be taken.",
      "\u201cEven last night, after Putin\u2019s conversation with ... Trump, when Putin said that he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy, there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,\u201d Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Helsinki with Finnish President Alexander Stubb.",
      "Russia said it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking equipment near one of its pipelines.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "Russian strikes, which hit civilian areas and damaged a hospital, followed Putin's refusal to back a full 30-day ceasefire during discussions with Trump.",
      "The White House described the call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a \u201cmovement to peace\u201d that Washington hopes will include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and eventually a full and lasting end to the fighting.",
      "But there was no indication that Putin backed away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.",
      "Stubb called the discussions between Putin and Trump a step in the right direction, but Finland's president said that Russia needs to end its aggression.",
      "\u201cThere are only two ways to respond to the proposal of the president of the United States: it\u2019s a yes or a no \u2014 no buts, no conditions,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cUkraine accepted a ceasefire without any forms of conditions. If Russia refuses to agree, we need to increase our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and ratchet up pressure on Russia to convince them to come to the negotiating table.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.",
      "Despite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including a direct drone strike on a hospital in Sumy and attacks on cities in Donetsk region. Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said that the military complied with Putin\u2019s order to halt energy infrastructure strikes and downed seven drones its forces fired before the order at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine\u2019s southern Mykolaiv region.",
      "Moscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said that three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Zelenskyy said that \u201cwords of a ceasefire\u201d weren't enough.",
      "\u201cIf the Russians don\u2019t hit our facilities, we definitely won\u2019t hit theirs,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",

      "Even as the economy undergoes what may be wrenching changes, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to signal it could cut its key interest rate twice this year \u2014 the same forecast it issued in December",
      "WASHINGTON -- Even as the economy undergoes what may be wrenching changes, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to signal it could cut its key interest rate twice this year \u2014 the same forecast it issued in December.",
      "Yet the reasons for those cuts may change dramatically, depending on how the economy fares.",
      "What were once seen as \u201cgood news\u201d rate reductions in response to a steady decline in inflation back to the Fed's target of 2%, now could become \u201cbad news\u201d cuts that would be implemented to offset an economy struggling in the wake of widespread tariffs, rapid cuts in government spending, and a spike in economic uncertainty.",
      "At the end of last year, the Fed reduced its key interest rate three times to about 4.3% from 5.3%. The Fed had rapidly raised its rate to combat inflation, and as price growth headed lower, that allowed the central bank to reverse some of those rate hikes. In September, inflation dropped to a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4%.",
      "Yet inflation then marched higher for four straight months, before it finally fell back in February, to an annual rate of 2.8%. Partly because of that reversal, Chair Jerome Powell has underscored that the Fed is in wait-and-see mode as it evaluates the impact of President Donald Trump's policies on the economy.",
      "So far, consumer sentiment has fallen sharply as Americans worry that inflation will rise in the coming months. Small business owners report a much more uncertain economic outlook, which can cause them to cut back on hiring and investment.",
      "Retailers of both high-end and lower-cost goods have warned that consumers are turning more cautious as they expect prices to rise because of tariffs. Retail sales rose modestly last month after a sharp fall in January. Homebuilders and contractors expect that home construction and renovations will get more expensive.",
      "On Tuesday, the Fed reported that manufacturing output jumped last month, driven higher by a spike in car production. Some of that could have reflected higher auto purchases by consumers looking to get ahead of tariffs. New home construction also grew faster than expected.",
      "Many economists have sharply reduced their forecasts for growth this year, with Barclays, a bank, now forecasting growth of just 0.7%, down from 2.5% in 2024. And economists at Goldman Sachs now expect inflation \u2014 excluding the volatile food and energy categories \u2014 will tick higher to 3% by the end of this year, up from its current level of 2.6%.",
      "Slower growth, if it also pushes up unemployment, and higher inflation would put the Fed in a very difficult spot. Typically, when companies start cutting workers, the Fed would reduce rates to spur more borrowing and spending and boost the economy.",
      "Yet if inflation crept higher, it would want to keep rates elevated to slow growth and restrain inflation. When the Fed lifts its key interest rate, it tends to push other borrowing costs higher, including for mortgages, auto loans, business loans, and credit cards.",
      "Economists will closely watch Powell's press conference Wednesday to see if he will signal how the Fed would handle such a situation.",
      "But Powell will probably double-down on his recent efforts to underscore that the Fed can, for now, watch from the sidelines.",
      "\u201cThe costs of being cautious are very, very low,\u201d Powell said earlier this month. \u201cThe economy\u2019s fine, it doesn\u2019t need us to do anything, really.\u201d",
      "Separately, Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, has previously said the Fed could still cut rates this year, even if tariffs were imposed, as long as inflation was still falling once the impact of was excluded.",
      "Yet earlier this month, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he acknowledged teasing out tariffs' impact on prices would be difficult.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to find the signal of what\u2019s fundamental, and what is maybe tariff noise,\" he said. \"And that\u2019s tough.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, intensifying efforts to exert his administration's control over independent agencies across the government.",
      "Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said they'd been dismissed illegally and would sue to block Trump's order. They also said they consider themselves still part of the FTC, though whether they will still have access to their offices and logistical tools like email going forward was unclear.",
      "Removing Bedoya and Slaughter could free up space on the five-member FTC for new commissioners loyal to Trump and his priorities and policies.",
      "The White House confirmed the dismissals. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, a Republican whom Trump designated for the role upon taking office in January, released a statement on X saying he had no doubts about Trump's \u201cconstitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability.\u201d",
      "The FTC is a regulator created by Congress that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation. Its seats are typically comprised of three members of the president\u2019s party and two from the opposing party.",
      "Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve seven-year terms that are staggered to prevent multiple vacancies at once.",
      "The ousted commissioners pointed to past Supreme Court rulings that sought to solidify the body\u2019s independence and only allowed commissioners to be removed for cause.",
      "\u201cThe president just illegally fired me. This is corruption plain and simple,\u201d Bedoya, who was appointed in 2021 by President Joe Biden and confirmed in May 2022, posted on X.",
      "He added, \"The FTC is an independent agency founded 111 years ago to fight fraudsters and monopolists\u201d but now \u201cthe president wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies.\u201d",
      "The White House countered late Tuesday night that other Supreme Court rulings affirmed the president\u2019s \u201cunrestricted\u201d power to remove \"executive officers who had been appointed by him.\u201d",
      "Slaughter was first appointed to the FTC during Trump's first administration in 2018, and served as its acting chair in 2021. Biden renominated her for a second term in February 2023. Slaughter said in her statement that the \"law protects the independence of the Commission because the law serves the American public, not corporate power.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemoving opposition may not change what the Trump majority can do, but it does change whether they will have accountability when they do it,\" she wrote.",
      "In 1935, the Supreme Court held that the president couldn\u2019t fire leaders of independent agencies without cause. Otherwise, the agencies would become more political and less independent.",
      "While that restriction was eroded in a subsequent decision that came in 2020, it has largely remained in place.",
      "The firings will likely intensify the legal fight around key questions about the extent of presidential powers \u2014 battles that could have consequences for other independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve. But the Trump administration has so far been undeterred in its push to expand a president\u2019s ability to remove such officials at will.",
      "The president used a previous executive order to give the White House more control over the FTC and other regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "On a subsequent conference call with reporters, Bedoya noted that the FTC was engaged in cases involving tech giants and drug companies and predicted that the move will help powerful corporations while meaning higher prices for consumers.",
      "\u201cWho does this attempt to remove us help?\u201d Bedoya asked. \u201cWho it helps is billionaires. And I think it opens the door for corruption and for (a) law enforcement apparatus controlled, not by the law, but by money.\u201d",
      "Slaughter said on the same call that she and Bedoya were informed at the end of the day about Trump's action and that no specific reason was given for the dismissals.",
      "\u201cWe are not going to go,\" Slaughter said. \"And we certainly are not going to go quietly.\u201d",
      "She added, \"Markets should be worried.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a sign that the guardrails are coming off the protections for freedom and fairness in our economy,\" Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it is a sign that honest businesses should be worried about corruption permeating markets.\u201d",
      "The issue of Trump asserting greater influence is particularly fraught for the Federal Reserve, an institution that has long sought to protect its independence. Economists and financial markets broadly support an independent Fed because they worry a politicized version would be more reluctant to take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates.",
      "Trump has signaled he will let Fed chair Jerome Powell serve out his term, which ends May 2026. Yet he threatened to fire Powell in 2018 when Powell raised interest rates, a move that can often slow growth.",
      "The dismissals of Bedoya and Slaughter follow the Trump administration removing several years worth of online \u201cbusiness guidance\u201d blogs published by the FTC under the Biden administration. According to various snapshots from the Internet Archive, more than 350 blog posts published on the agency\u2019s website were taken down as of Tuesday.",
      "The removed blog posts covered a wide range of information, from steps the FTC was taking to prevent harms of AI-enabled voice cloning to an explanation of its lawsuit against Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription program. Blog posts published between 2010 and 2017, under Obama, are still up on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, an advocacy group that opposes monopolistic practices, said Bedoya and Slaughter's dismissals were \u201cillegal and void.\u201d",
      "\u201cIndependent agencies like the FTC exist to enforce the law as written by Congress and protect the public interest,\" Hegde said in a statement. \u201cNot to be gutted at the whim of a president.\u201d",
      "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the only Democrat on both the Judiciary and Commerce committees, called the dismals \u201ca blatantly illegal act.\"",
      "\u201cIt is another unconstitutional power grab. I'm glad you're suing,\u201d Klobuchar said on the conference call with Bedoya and Slaughter. \"In the end, I strongly believe that you will win and you will be reinstated as commissioners.\"",

      "Delaware is trying to protect its status as the corporate capital of the world amid fallout from a judge rejecting billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s landmark compensation package from Tesla",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Delaware is trying to protect its status as the corporate capital of the world amid fallout from a judge's rejection of billionaire Elon Musk \u2019s landmark Tesla compensation package, although critics say fast-tracked legislation will tilt the playing field against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers.",
      "A Delaware House committee was expected to vote Wednesday on the bill, which is backed by Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer who says it'll ensure the state remains the \"premier home for U.S. and global businesses\u201d to incorporate.",
      "Backers say it'll modernize the law and maintain balance between corporate officers and shareholders in a state where the courts, for a century, have settled all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "Critics \u2014 including institutional investors, pension funds and asset managers \u2014 say it\u2019ll lower corporate governance standards, curb shareholder rights and, as a result, limit the ability to hold corporate officers accountable for decisions that violate their fiduciary duty.",
      "The bill passed the state Senate unanimously last week.",
      "A Delaware judge last year invalidated Musk's compensation package from Tesla that was potentially worth more than $55 billion. Lawyers for shareholders had sued over the package that Tesla\u2019s board of directors awarded Musk in 2018.",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick said it was developed by directors who weren\u2019t independent of Musk and approved by shareholders who had been given misleading and incomplete disclosures in a proxy statement.",
      "The ruling bumped Musk out of the top spot on Forbes' list of wealthiest people, although he has since climbed back up.",
      "Musk and Tesla are appealing in the state Supreme Court. But Musk unloaded on Delaware, saying \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware\u201d and instead recommended competitors Nevada or Texas as destinations.",
      "Now, lawmakers are being warned by corporate lawyers that their clients are considering heading to the exits \u2014 making a \u201cDexit,\u201d as it's been dubbed \u2014 and that startups are being advised to incorporate elsewhere.",
      "Must took his own advice, moving Tesla\u2019s corporate listing to Texas after a shareholder vote and his companies SpaceX to Texas and Neuralink to Nevada.",
      "Backers of the bill say corporate unrest had been simmering the past couple years over various Delaware Supreme Court decisions in corporate conflict-of-interest cases and that Musk inflamed the discontent.",
      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta didn't confirm the report.",
      "DropBox, the online file-sharing platform, moved its corporate listing to Nevada, and Bill Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, a major hedge fund, said he\u2019d leave Delaware, too.",
      "On Feb. 1, Musk took to his social media platform X to crow about it, saying, \u201cCompanies are flooding out of Delaware, because the activist chief judge of the Delaware court has no respect for shareholder rights.\u201d",
      "That said, critics of the bill say there's no evidence that corporations are fleeing Delaware in any numbers.",
      "It changes several things.",
      "One, it gives corporations more protections in conflict-of-interest cases \u2014 such as a pay package for a CEO or intercompany agreements \u2014 in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",
      "Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, has compiled a running list of three dozen Delaware Supreme Court precedents that the legislation stands to change.",
      "Lawrence Hamermesh, a former professor at Widener University\u2019s Delaware Law School, disagreed. Hamermesh, who helped draft the legislation after Meyer asked him last month, said perhaps only a couple doctrines would be wiped out.",
      "A legal challenge is widely expected should Meyer get the bill and sign it into law. Meanwhile, institutional investors say such a law may prompt them to push corporations that they own to incorporate elsewhere.",
      "Money.",
      "Approximately one-third of Delaware\u2019s state government revenue \u2014 about $2.2 billion \u2014 comes from corporate license fees and associated tax revenues, according to the governor's office. That helps the state to maintain a 0% sales tax and keep property taxes relatively low, a nice perk for the beach vacation home industry along its Atlantic coast.",
      "Beyond that, Wilmington is home to a cottage industry that caters to the corporate lawyers who live, stay, dine and shop around the state Supreme Court and the Chancery Court of Delaware buildings where they argue their cases.",

      "States with aggressive climate goals like Oregon are facing a conundrum",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The pothole outside Timothy Taylor's home was so deep, he could hear the clunk of cars hitting it from inside his house.",
      "The Portland, Oregon, resident could sympathize with those drivers: He knew to avoid his own neighborhood pothole, but another one damaged his car's suspension to the tune of $1,000.",
      "\u201cHearing that awful sound of your car bottoming out \u2014 it\u2019s horrible,\" he said.",
      "Oregon transportation officials say that without more funding, residents like Taylor could see further declines in the quality of roads, highways and bridges starting this year. But revenues from gas taxes paid by drivers at the pump are projected to decrease as more people adopt electric and fuel-efficient cars, forcing officials to look for new ways to fund transportation infrastructure.",
      "States with aggressive climate goals like Oregon are facing a conundrum: EVs can help reduce emissions in the transportation sector, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they also mean less gas tax revenue in government coffers.",
      "\u201cWe now find ourselves right now in a position where we want to address fuel use and drive down reliance on gases and internal combustion engines. But we need the funds to operate our roads that EVs need to use as well,\u201d said Carra Sahler, director of the Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.",
      "Motor fuel taxes are the largest source of transportation revenue for states, according to the National Association of Budget Officers\u2019 most recent report on state expenditures. But the money they bring in has fallen: Gas taxes raised 41% of transportation revenue in fiscal year 2016, compared with roughly 36% in fiscal year 2024, the group found.",
      "In California, where zero-emission vehicles accounted for about a quarter of all car sales last year, legislative analysts predict gas tax collections will decrease by $5 billion \u2014 or 64% \u2014 by 2035, in a scenario where the state successfully meets its climate goals. California and Oregon are among the multiple states that will require all new passenger cars sold to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.",
      "The downward revenue trend is already playing out in Pennsylvania, where gas tax revenues dropped an estimated $250 million last year compared with 2019, according to the state\u2019s independent fiscal office.",
      "Inflation has also driven up the cost of transportation materials, further exacerbating budget concerns.",
      "The Oregon Department of Transportation \u2014 citing inflation, projections of declining gas tax revenues and certain spending limitations \u2014 has estimated a budget shortfall topping $350 million for the next budget cycle.",
      "That could mean cuts to winter snow plowing and the striping and paving of roads, as well as layoffs of as many as 1,000 transportation employees.",
      "Republican lawmakers say the gas tax revenue issue has been compounded by the department mismanaging its money. An audit released in January found the department overestimated its revenue for the current budget cycle by over $1 billion and failed to properly track certain funds.",
      "\u201cIt really is about making sure that the existing dollars that are being spent by the department are being spent efficiently and effectively,\u201d said state Sen. Bruce Starr, GOP co-vice chair of the joint transportation committee.",
      "To make up for lost revenue, 34 states have raised their gas tax since 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California has the highest gas tax at over 69 cents a gallon when including other taxes and fees, while Alaska has the lowest at 9 cents a gallon, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In Oregon \u2014 which in 1919 became the first state to implement a gas tax \u2014 it is 40 cents a gallon.",
      "The federal gas tax of 18 cents a gallon, which isn\u2019t adjusted for inflation, hasn\u2019t been raised in over three decades.",
      "In Oregon, where there is no sales tax and tolling has met fierce opposition, lawmakers are debating next steps.",
      "Other states have taken steps ranging from indexing their gas tax to inflation, to raising registration fees for EVs, to taxing EV charging stations.",
      "To bolster transportation dollars, some have reorganized their budgets: In Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was first elected using the slogan \u201cFix the Damn Roads,\u201d some revenues from marijuana taxes and personal income taxes now go toward transportation. In Connecticut, the sales tax now brings in more money for its special transportation fund than gas tax revenues, a 2024 fiscal report shows.",
      "Another concept that could provide a long-term solution is a so-called road user charge. Under such a system, drivers pay a fee based on the distance they travel.",
      "In 2023, Hawaii established a road usage charge program for EV drivers that will phase in starting this July. In 2028, all EV drivers will be automatically enrolled, with odometers read at annual vehicle inspections.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Oregon, Utah and Virginia \u2014 have voluntary road usage fee programs. Drivers can opt to use GPS tools to track and report their mileage.",

      "IQALUIT, Nunavut -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a multibillion-dollar radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada's far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region.",
      "The prime minister's office said that the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) \u201cOver-the-Horizon Radar\u201d system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney made the announcement at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut. It was his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201cCanada is and forever will be an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",

      "Canada\u2019s top military commander also planned to announce that the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada\u2019s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. Carney said Canada will have a \u201cgreater sustained year-round presence.\u201d",
      "The prime minister is in Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cThe United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.",
      "For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada\u2019s central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures.",
      "It is a distinctive destination \u2014 home to about 7,500 people but not a single traffic light \u2014 with no road or rail links to the outside world.",
      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put the Arctic at the heart of the debate over global trade and security.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- With U.S. support for Ukraine in doubt, Kyiv's European allies are weighing whether to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian assets and use the money to compensate Ukraine, support its military and help rebuild shattered homes and towns.",
      "For now, the assets are still on ice, with opponents of seizure warning that the move could violate international law and destabilize financial markets.",
      "Here are key things to know about the debate surrounding the Kremlin assets that were frozen shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022:",
      "Originally, the money was in short-term government bonds held as reserves for the Russian central bank. By now, most of the bonds have have matured and turned into cash piling up in custodian banks. Some 210 billion euros are in European Union member states, with the biggest chunk, some 183 billion euros, at Euroclear, a Belgian clearinghouse for financial transactions. Other amounts are at financial institutions in Great Britain, Japan, France, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and Singapore.",
      "So far, the Group of Seven democracies have used the interest on the frozen cash to fund $50 billion in upfront assistance to Ukraine by borrowing against future interest income. That solution avoids legal and financial complications associated with outright confiscating the money and giving it it to Ukraine.",
      "Some of Ukraine's friends \u2014 Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2014 want to do more by taking the principal as well, given the enormous damage Russia has done. The World Bank estimates that reconstructing Ukraine will cost $524 billion over 10 years, already more than the total of the Russian assets. If one or more Western governments resists seizing the assets, the others that want to could still go ahead.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine's allies in Europe are contemplating stepping up their financial aid in the wake of statements by U.S. President Donald Trump that Europe must take care of its own security. Several of those allies \u2014 France and Belgium, for instance \u2014 are already saddled with troublesome debt levels above 100% of gross domestic product.",
      "European leaders say seizing the assets now would mean they couldn't be used as a bargaining chip in any peace deal or to help enforce a ceasefire.",
      "French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said Tuesday that it was against international law to seize assets in central banks. If Russian assets were seized without legal grounds, \"it could pose a risk to European financial stability,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI advocate great caution when it comes to those frozen assets,\u201d Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said at a March 6 EU summit. \u201cAt the moment, that is actually a chicken that also lays golden eggs. Those windfall profits are going to Ukraine.\"",
      "Opponents of seizure also fear that countries and investors would hesitate to use European financial institutions if they are afraid assets could be seized, undermining the euro's role as an international currency for state reserves.",
      "More specifically, governments worry that countries such as Saudi Arabia and China may sell European government bonds in response, said Elina Ribakova, an economist with the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. That would raise borrowing costs for governments already deep in debt.",
      "She favors seizure, however, arguing that the European Central Bank has tools to thwart any unjustified bond selloff by purchasing government bonds.",
      "Also looming over the issue are memories of the 2010-2012 European government debt crisis, in which borrowing costs spiked and raised concerns the euro currency could break up.",
      "There is a \u201cgood deal of PTSD in the EU around messing with the EU sovereign bond market\u201d because of that, said Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "Some experts argue that seizure would be an appropriate \u201ccountermeasure.\u201d That's a specific legal term referring to an action that would normally be illegal but which is justified as a means to push Russia to stop its own violations of international law.",
      "\u201cThere is no dilemma between using an aggressor's assets to protect its victim and maintaining a commitment to the rules-based order,\u201d wrote Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Britain's former ambassador to Belarus, in a legal analysis.",
      "Other scholars say confiscation would not be a legitimate countermeasure.",
      "One reason: justifying a countermeasure as compensation for damages \u2014 instead of merely as pressure to behave \u2014 would be \u201ca very significant expansion of the way we have used countermeasures in the past,\" said Ingrid Brunk, professor of international law at Vanderbilt University Law School. \u201dI would term it as a violation of international law on countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Additionally, Brunk said international law grants strong protection to central bank reserves against seizure \u2014 a principle that has been \u201cabsolutely sacrosanct for a century.\u201d",

      "Keatinge said the legal question is a \u201c50-50 call.\u201d It boils down to a question of \u201cpolitical will.\"",
      "Frozen state assets were used to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Iran's 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Those actions were legally justified because they were part of post-conflict peace deals: a U.N. resolution in the case of Iraq, and by diplomatic accords in the case of Iran, noted Brunk.",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that the seizure of Russian assets would be illegitimate and erode investors\u2019 confidence. \u201cWe view those intentions as unlawful, and any attempt to fulfill them would entail very serious legal consequences,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Russia could, in theory, seize the assets of the estimated 1,800 Western companies that continue to do business in Russia. Recent legislation would enable state seizure of companies based in countries designated as \u201cunfriendly,\u201d Russian news media report.",
      "However, there's less to seize on Russia's end. Foreign companies have suffered more than $170 billion in losses since 2022, often as they decided to leave Russia or scale back there, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.",

      "A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating $14 billion in grants awarded to three climate groups by the Biden administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from terminating $14 billion in grants awarded to three climate groups by the Biden administration, saying the government's \u201cvague and unsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.\u201d",
      "The order by U.S. District Judge Tonya Chutkan prevents \u2014 for now \u2014 the Environmental Protection Agency from ending the grant program, which totaled $20 billion. The judge also blocked Citibank, which holds the money on behalf of EPA, from transferring it to the government or anyone else.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin accused the grant recipients of mismanagement, fraud and self-dealing and froze the grants. But after reviewing arguments in the case, Chutkan said Zeldin's allegations fell short.",
      "\u201cAt this juncture, EPA Defendants have not sufficiently explained why unilaterally terminating Plaintiffs\u2019 grant awards was a rational precursor to reviewing\u201d the green bank program, Chutkan wrote.",
      "She was the third judge of the day to rule against the Trump administration. The trio of rulings came within hours of an extraordinary conflict, as President Donald Trump called for the impeachment of another judge who had temporarily blocked deportation flights. Trump's message drew a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "Climate United Fund and other groups had sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, saying they had illegally denied the groups access to $14 billion awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \u201cgreen bank.\" The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects.",
      "Climate United and two other groups, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities, said the freeze not only prevented them from financing new projects, but might force them to lay off staff. They said the allegations they were mishandling funds were utterly meritless.",
      "The nonprofits also wanted Judge Chutkan to order Citibank to unfreeze the account. She declined to do so. The order simply preserves the status quo while the case proceeds.",
      "Climate United was awarded nearly $7 billion, the Coalition for Green Capital won $5 billion and Power Forward Communities was awarded $2 billion. Republicans unanimously voted against the law that created the grant program and have denounced it as an unaccountable \"slush fund.''",
      "After the funds were frozen, the EPA moved to terminate the grants.",
      "Climate United CEO Beth Bafford said the judge's decision Tuesday was \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the coming weeks, we will continue working towards a long-term solution that will allow us to invest in projects that deliver energy savings, create jobs, and boost American manufacturing in communities across the country,\u201d Bafford said.",
      "Zeldin said in a statement posted on X Tuesday that the grants were awarded \u201cin a manner that deliberately reduced the ability of EPA to conduct proper oversight.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will not rest until these hard-earned taxpayer dollars are returned to the U.S. Treasury,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin has characterized the grants as a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme marred by conflicts of interest and potential fraud.",
      "\u201cTwenty billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution, in a deliberate effort to limit government oversight \u2014 doling out your money through just eight pass-through, politically connected, unqualified and in some cases brand-new\u201d nonprofit organizations, Zeldin said in a video previously posted online.",
      "Climate United countered that the termination was unlawful, arguing the federal government had identified no evidence of waste, fraud or abuse.",

      "BERLIN -- Questions are mounting in Canada and in Europe over whether big-ticket purchases of high-end U.S. weaponry, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, are still a wise strategic choice for Western countries worried about their investment in U.S. defense technology.",
      "In less than two months, U.S. President Donald Trump has upended decades of U.S. foreign policy. He has left NATO members questioning whether the U.S. will honor the alliance's commitment to defend each other if other European countries are attacked by Russia. He's also made repeat overtures to Russia and suspended most U.S. foreign aid.",
      "And Pete Hegseth, Trump's defense secretary, last month told a gathering of European defense ministers \u201cthat stark strategic realities\u201d prevent the U.S. from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.",
      "That could impact foreign sales of the Lockheed Martin-produced F-35 and other advanced U.S. jets like the F-16. As the war in Ukraine continues into its fourth year, it's become clear that Eastern European NATO members still have vast stores of Soviet-era weapons in their stockpiles that were not interoperable with Western weaponry. A long-term plan to get all of NATO on similar platforms \u2014 by replacing old Soviet-era jets with Western ones, particularly the F-16 and in some cases, the F-35 \u2014 has gained momentum.",
      "Some of the NATO countries are now re-thinking tying their defense to U.S.-made systems and potentially considering European jets like the Saab Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale instead.",
      "In Canada, where Trump has launched a trade war and has threatened economic coercion to make it the 51st American state, new Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked Defense Minister Bill Blair to review its purchase of F-35s. Canada has been a partner with the U.S. in developing the F-35.",
      "Blair will see if there are other options \u201cgiven the changing environment,\u201d a defense spokesman said.",
      "And in Portugal, the outgoing defense minister said in an interview with a Portuguese newspaper published last week that \u201crecent positions\u201d taken by the U.S. compelled a rethink about the purchase of F-35s because the U.S. has become unpredictable. Portugal is considering various options to replace its F-16s.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not just buying an airplane, you\u2019re buying a relationship with the United States,\u201d said Winslow T. Wheeler, a longtime government watchdog who spent 30 years in the U.S. Congress working for Democrats and Republicans on national security and defense issues. \u201cPeople in the past have not just welcomed but craved that kind of relationship.\u201d",
      "The Netherlands and Norway have voiced recent support for the F-35 program in comments to the media.",
      "\u201cThe F-35 is a vital component of our national defense capability, and the cooperation and dialogue with the United States continues to support the development and use of this high-end platform,\" Norwegian State Secretary Andreas Fl\u00e5m said in a statement. \u201dWe expect this constructive cooperation to continue into the future.\"",
      "The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was designed to combine stealth, maneuverability and attack capabilities in a single aircraft. Each jet costs about $85 million (78 million euros), and the price jumps to $100 million (91 million euros) to $150 million (137 million euros) when supporting infrastructure and spare parts are included. About 1,100 have been produced to date for 16 military services across the globe.",
      "The F-35B, a variant that can take off from ship decks vertically, is the latest model. It's the most expensive weapons system the U.S. has ever produced, with estimated lifetime costs now expected to top $1.7 trillion. One of the ways the program was counting on reducing those costs was by selling more aircraft to international customers.",
      "But the Trump administration's recent pause on providing intelligence to Ukraine to force the country to negotiate with Russia has fueled fears that the U.S. may have similar ways to coerce them in a future fight \u2014 such as by embedding a hypothetical \u201ckill switch\u201d in the F-35's millions of lines of programming.",
      "In a statement, the Pentagon's F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office on Tuesday vehemently rejected any notion that jets sold to allies could be remotely disabled.",
      "\u201cThere is no kill switch. The F-35 was conceived, developed, and continues to be operated and sustained as a joint/coalition platform, built on strong partnerships with U.S. allies and partner nations across the globe,\u201d the office said in a statement. \u201cThe strength of the F-35 program lies in its global partnership, and we remain committed to providing all users with the full functionality and support they require.\u201d",
      "But that's not the only way to impact an ally's program, Wheeler said. The F-35 requires constant U.S.-controlled tech upgrades to operate in combat. If a relationship with the U.S. soured and updates were delayed, it could make a jet, or even a fleet, inoperable, he said.",
      "Lockheed Martin, in a statement Tuesday, said the company is committed to helping its customers \u201cstrengthen their airpower and security with the F-35.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs part of our government contracts, we deliver all system infrastructure and data required for all F-35 customers to sustain the aircraft,\u201d the defense contractor said. \u201cWe remain committed to providing affordable and reliable sustainment services to our customers that enable them to complete their missions and come home safely.\u201d",
      "The Saab Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale could see an increase in sales if other countries decide to forgo their F-35 purchases. But none of them have the stealth capabilities of the F-35.",
      "The Swedish-made Saab Gripen is used by the militaries of Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa,Brazil and Thailand. Conventional defense industry wisdom says it's significantly cheaper than the F-35, Wheeler said.",
      "The Eurofighter Typhoon, a swing-role combat aircraft, is part of the British, German, Spanish and Italian forces. It's manufactured by a consortium of defense companies: Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo.",
      "The French-built Dassault Rafale twin-jet fighter is used by the French Navy and the French Air and Space Force. The governments of Egypt, India, Qatar, Greece, Croatia, the United Arab Emirates, Serbia and Indonesia have all signed contracts for Rafales.",
      "David Jordan, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King\u2019s College London and co-director of the Freeman Air and Space Institute, said that previously, European leaders felt it was easier and more cost-effective to lean on the U.S. defense industry \u2014 and American taxpayers \u2014 to get access to advanced weaponry. But the Trump administration's move away from Europe could be the turning point, Jordan said.",
      "It would require the continent to pool its money and resources \u2014 often a sticking point among the countries \u2014 into research and development, manufacturing and logistics, but Jordan said it's possible within five to 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe European defense industry is more than capable of building what it needs,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is already ramping up his efforts to persuade France\u2019s allies to switch to European defense contractors and weapons systems, including French-built Rafale fighters.",
      "\u201cThose who buy the F-35 should be offered the Rafale. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll increase the pace,\u201d La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi quoted Macron as saying during a press briefing Friday to journalists from regional French newspapers.",
      "If the Europeans increase their production, it would greatly affect the bottom lines of Lockheed Martin and other U.S. defense companies. Jordan said U.S. defense contractors are likely concerned about Trump\u2019s next move.",
      "\u201cAt what point will they say \u2018we don\u2019t like this, we\u2019re talking about risking billions of dollars here,\u2019\u201d Jordan said.",

      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",

      "MANDAN, N.D. -- Closing arguments are scheduled to begin on Monday in a pipeline company's lawsuit against Greenpeace, a case the environmental advocacy group said could have consequences for free speech and protest rights and threaten the organization's future.",
      "The jury will deliberate after the closing arguments and jury instructions. Nine jurors and two alternates have heard the case.",
      "North Dakota District Court Judge James Gion told the jury last month when the trial began, \u201cYou are the judges of all questions of fact in this case,\u201d and to \u201cbase your verdict on the evidence.\u201d",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access alleged defamation, trespass, nuisance and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, its American branch Greenpeace USA, and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. The pipeline company is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline and its Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe for years has opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline has transported oil since mid-2017.",
      "Trey Cox, an attorney for the pipeline company, previously said Greenpeace \u201cplanned, organized and funded a game plan to stop construction\u201d of the pipeline, \u201cwhatever the cost.\u201d",
      "Cox also alleged Greenpeace paid outsiders to come into the area to protest, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue statements to stop the line from being built.",
      "He said a letter signed by leaders of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA and sent to Energy Transfer's banks contained an allegedly defamatory statement that the company desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\u201d and the company lost half its banks, Cox said.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace entities denied the allegations, saying there is no evidence, they had little or no involvement with the protests and the letter was signed by hundreds of organizations from dozens of countries, with no financial institution to testify the organization received, read or was influenced by the letter.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech.",

      "Baseball in Japan \u2014 the game is called \"yakyu\" (field ball) in Japanese \u2014 carries more of a rock-concert vibe than its American cousin. And with Shohei Ohtani teasing fans for a week in Tokyo as the two-game series approached, it\u2019s a true spectacle.",
      "You don't see the following routinely in North America. You did Tuesday in the Tokyo Dome.",
      "Young women carry beer kegs on their backs, drawing a cold draft while you're seated watching the game. Fans are clearly more animated. Even elderly men come with a glove \u2014 just in case. And chopsticks are in use as fans watching the game snack on noodles or a rice dish.",
      "The food selection at the concession stands is mostly Asian, but popcorn and beer are plentiful. You can even buy a version of Cracker Jack.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said he played baseball in Puerto Rico and Mexico and suggested the Japanese game and the Latin American game were linked.",
      "\u201cI would say the similarity is the passion from the fans. I think in Tokyo it's a little more controlled emotion, chaos. Where in Latin America, playing winter ball \u2014 in the best possible way \u2014 it's chaotic and a lot of passion.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's definitely close,\" Dodgers Venezuelan shortstop Miguel Rojas said. \u201cThey enjoy the game a little bit different than the United States. This is the closest thing you will find (to Latin America).\"",

    "story": [
      "The two biggest names in college basketball these days will be playing in the women\u2019s tournament when March Madness gets into full swing",
      "It\u2019s no stretch to say the two biggest names in college basketball these days will be playing in the women\u2019s tournament when March Madness goes into full swing later this week.",
      "Whether the presence of Juju Watkins of USC and Paige Bueckers of UConn will overcome the game\u2019s loss of Caitlin Clark and drive a repeat of last year\u2019s history-making surge in viewership is among the underlying questions over the next three weeks.",
      "One of the surest signs of the growing popularity of the women's game came last year, when the final of the tournament, featuring Clark's Iowa Hawkeyes against coach Dawn Staley\u2019s South Carolina juggernaut,drew more viewers than the men\u2019s final between UConn and Purdue.",
      "It was a first, driven in part by the fact that the men\u2019s game wasn\u2019t on an over-the-air network and the women\u2019s was, but also thanks to the legion of Clark fans, many of whom have followed her to the WNBA.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to believe they\u2019re going to reach the Caitlin Clark number again, because that was a comet that probably won\u2019t be repeated this year,\u201d Kevin Hull, a sports media professor at South Carolina, said of the 18.87 million who tuned into the women's title game last year. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to get a really good number again. It\u2019s a great time to be in women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "Besides Duke freshman Cooper Flagg, there aren\u2019t any men\u2019s players who can rival the numbers Bueckers or Watkins put up in what might be the most important metric in today's world \u2013 their social media followings. Last week, in a notable transaction, Watkins became the first woman college athlete to sign an endorsement deal with Fanatics.",
      "It\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t compelling story lines in the men\u2019s tournament. But as has often been the case, they have more to do with coaches \u2013 think, Rick Pitino at St. John\u2019s \u2013 or programs \u2013 think Duke or North Carolina \u2014 than with individual players.",
      "Last year's biggest name on the men's side was Purdue's Zach Edey, a well-spoken but generally quiet 7-foot-4 center from Canada whose old-school post-up game sparked a fascinating debate for hardcore hoops junkies, but didn't bring the rest of the world in.",
      "For decades, though, none of that ever prevented the men\u2019s tournament from outdrawing the women. Among the advantages for the men: more backing from the NCAA, a longer history as a sport and a deeper, more competitive field from 1-68, which, in turn, spawns more upsets and Cinderella stories.",
      "Without some of those built-in advantages, the women\u2019s game has had to embark on a slow, steady climb.",
      "Hull believes one landmark moment was the success of the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team in the 1990s, which \u201ckind of changed the game when it came to all women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen it in the years since, with the WNBA and all these other sports,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Caitlin Clark was the right person at the right time, who just sort of turned the spark into a flame.\u201d",
      "The women\u2019s tournament was already surging in popularity in 2021 (the first year ESPN broadcast every game nationally) when Sedona Prince lit a fuse with her viral video of the sparse weight room available to the players at their base in San Antonio.",
      "It forced a reckoning with some of the longstanding inequalities between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games. The most devastating was the huge disparity of the TV contracts but perhaps the best illustration of the imbalance came in the fact that the NCAA didn\u2019t even use the \u201cMarch Madness\u201d title for the women\u2019s tournament.",
      "The renegotiation of the TV contract (some say for not enough), combined with Clark\u2019s rise and a layering of some Magic-vs.-Bird-like racial tension between Clark and Angel Reese (who say they have no problem with each other) helped push popularity and viewership to the heights seen last year.",
      "Len Elmore, the longtime player and TV analyst who now teaches sports management at Columbia, suggested the Clark vs. Reese vibe created a tension that many Americans can't turn away from. He also said \u201csome people like the women\u2019s game better than the men\u2019s game for a number of fundamental basketball reasons.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, the NCAA announced that women's teams, for the first time, would receive payments \u2014 known as \u201cunits\u201d \u2014 for playing in March Madness.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with us being treated like a sport now,\u201d said Staley, whose Gamecocks are top seeded as they embark on their quest for back-to-back titles. \u201cWhen you treat us like a sport, you will get a return on your investment.\u201d",
      "Most signs point toward last year\u2019s ratings as part of a sustainable trend.",
      "A matchup between Watkins and Bueckers in December averaged 2.2 million viewers, making it the second-most watched women\u2019s game ever on Fox, behind one last season in which Clark set the NCAA scoring record. ESPN\u2019s regular-season ratings were up 3% from last year and 41% from two seasons ago.",
      "Next comes March Madness, where Watkins and Bueckers could face a rematch in the regional finals, while Staley and South Carolina are positioned on the other side of the bracket, setting up a possible meeting with one of them in the final on April 6.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident in saying that the days of the men\u2019s Final Four dwarfing the women\u2019s -- double, three-times viewership \u2013 those days are long gone,\u201d Hull said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the women\u2019s gets more. There\u2019s buzz now, and the TV networks are treating it as a big deal.\u201d",

      "Watkins is averaging 24.6 points \u2014 2.5 less than last year \u2014 and 6.9 rebounds while playing 35 minutes a game. She\u2019s notched six games with 30 or more points, her best being a 40-point effort against California Baptist.",
      "Last season, Watkins led USC to the program\u2019s deepest run in the NCAA Tournament in over 25 years. She was the nation\u2019s No. 2 scorer, averaging 27.1 points, and she led all freshmen in scoring with a record 920 points.

      "Still, the urge to be better is always there.",
      "\u201cShe looks at what she can improve first. She never points a finger at somebody else,\u201d USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s always where can she grow and that\u2019s a pretty remarkable trait for a 19-year-old.\u201d",
      "Part of Watkins\u2019 support system is Phil Handy, a 53-year-old former Los Angeles Lakers assistant who coached in the women\u2019s Unrivaled Basketball League this season. They met through a mutual family friend when Watkins was in eighth grade.",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s really challenged herself in that way to become a smarter player to where she understands how to read defenses and what teams are doing,\u201d Handy said.",
      "Watkins chose to attend college in her hometown \u2014 just a few miles from her primarily Hispanic and Black neighborhood of Watts \u2014 and the community comes out to support her. Men, women and children of all ages and races clamor for photos and autographs after games and Watkins patiently rewards them.",

      "Her off-court business overseen by Klutch Sports is thriving. She has NIL deals with Nike, Fanatics, snack maker Mondelez, United Airlines, Degree deodorant, State Farm, Gatorade and collectibles company Funko, among others.

      "Watkins, of course, is the main focus of opposing defenders who by now know her go-to spots on the floor and try to take them away. But she\u2019s got a running mate in forward Kiki Iriafen, a graduate transfer from Stanford who returned to her hometown.",
      "Iriafen\u2019s 18.2-point average is second to Watkins while her field goal, 3-point and free throw averages are all higher than the sophomore.",

      "The players\u2019 association co-founded by Novak Djokovic has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women\u2019s and men\u2019s professional tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport\u2019s integrity agency",
      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Calling the groups in charge of professional tennis \u201ca cartel,\u201d the players' association co-founded by Novak Djokovic filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's and men's tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport's integrity agency on Tuesday in federal court in New York.",
      "The suit by the Professional Tennis Players' Association says the organizations that run the sport hold \u201ccomplete control over the players\u2019 pay and working conditions\u201d and their setup constitutes \u201ctextbook violations of state and federal law\u201d that \u201cimmunize professional tennis from ordinary market forces and deny professional tennis players and other industry participants their right to fair competition.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and wants players to gain access to more earnings, arguing that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments \u2014 Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open and the Australian Open \u2014 and other professional events \u201ccap the prize money tournaments award and limit players\u2019 ability to earn money off the court.\u201d",
      "The WTA Tour and ATP Tour issued separate statements Tuesday saying they would \u201cvigorously\u201d defend themselves.",
      "The WTA said it has \u201ccommitted to a $400 million increase in player compensation\u201d in recent years and labeled the PTPA action a \u201cbaseless legal case\u201d that is \u201cregrettable and misguided.\u201d The ATP touted a \u201cmajor increase in player compensation\u201d that created a jump of \u201c$70 million in the past five years,\u201d and called the PTPA's case \u201centirely without merit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,\u201d the ATP's statement said. \u201cFive years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.\u201d",
      "The ITF and the International Tennis Integrity Agency \u2014 which investigates and adjudicates doping and corruption cases \u2014 declined to comment.",
      "The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in August 2020, aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport. One of the goals made clear along the way was to become a sort of full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports.",
      "\u201cFor the past few years, the PTPA, an organization I\u2019ve worked on tirelessly since its inception, has made countless efforts to collaborate with the tours in hopes of achieving positive change for players. Despite these efforts and attempts to engage in constructive dialogue, we were met with resistance and a lack of meaningful action. It is because of this ongoing disregard for players that we were left with no alternative but to take action of our own,\u201d Pospisil posted on social media. \u201cFor too long, players have been forced to accept a broken system that ignores our well-being, undervalues our contributions, and leaves us without real representation.\u201d",
      "Djokovic is not one of the players listed as a plaintiff.",
      "\u201cHis support for this is already explicit. It\u2019s redundant since PTPA (is) named as plaintiff, and he is on (the executive committee),\u201d PTPA spokesman David Cooper wrote in an email. \u201cHe wanted to allow others to step up since this is not just Novak\u2019s (organization).\u201d",
      "The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players \u2014 women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings \u2014 before going to court.",
      "\u201cTennis is broken,\u201d PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said in a news release. \u201cBehind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn\u2019t about disrupting tennis \u2014 it\u2019s about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.\u201d",

      "ROME -- The track's essential structure is done. The ice is being prepared. And next week, 60 athletes are slated to test the controversial sliding center for next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics.",
      "\u201cThe track\u2019s structure is done. We had it in our calendars to finish by March 16 and that\u2019s when it was finished,\u201d Fabio Saldini, the government commissioner in charge of rebuilding the century-old track in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "Construction workers celebrated Sunday\u2019s milestone by laying down a branch of an evergreen tree across the track.",
      "\u201cThe tree branch represents a starting point, like when (bobsled) teams get ready to push off before launching themselves down the track,\u201d said Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region that includes Cortina. \u201cI hope that the enthusiasm builds minute by minute in a crescendo worthy of an event of this magnitude.\u201d",
      "Twenty workers preparing ice on the track day and night are slated to finish by Sunday.",
      "Then starting on Monday, bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes will perform test runs in order to secure preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track. Also coming are 26 coaches, plus officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation, and the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Even preliminary approval would go a long way toward avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time.",
      "\u201cAs of today, 50% of the ice is ready,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cWe had some trouble last week due to high temperatures, rain and snow. But then we covered the track with nets and yesterday we actually put down too much ice.\u201d",
      "Security has been increased around the track since a refrigeration tube was removed and placed across a road in a reported act of sabotage last month, according to the government agency, Simico.",
      "Besides the sliding events, Cortina will also host women\u2019s Alpine skiing and curling during the Winter Games.",
      "Pre-fabricated mobile homes that will host up to 1,400 athletes in an Athletes' Village in Cortina are being put in place this month. The mobile homes will also be used for athletes during the Paralympics.",

      "Coventry would be the first woman and first African leader in the IOC\u2019s 131-year history. She has long been seen as Bach\u2019s favored successor, giving her a solid base of votes though likely not decisive in the first round of voting.",
      "Also standing are Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan, a member of the IOC executive board, and three presidents of sports governing bodies: skiing\u2019s Johan Eliasch, who is also a billionaire sportswear brand owner; cycling\u2019s David Lappartient; and Morinari Watanabe of gymnastics.",
      "The winner Thursday must get an absolute majority of votes. Until then, the candidate with the fewest votes in each round will be eliminated. The term of office is eight years.",
      "IOC voters invited into the exclusive club are a global mix of royal family members, former lawmakers and diplomats, business leaders, sports officials and Olympic athletes.",

      "Florida center Olivier Rioux, the world\u2019s tallest teenager, is one of the team's most popular players heading into the NCAA Tournament",
      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Olivier Rioux pokes his head out the front door of Florida\u2019s practice facility \u2014 the 7-foot-9 center has to duck, of course \u2014 and delivers a tidbit.",
      "\u201cAlberta reached out about doing a TikTok,\u201d he says.",
      "Blank stares.",
      "\u201cAlberta, the mascot,\u201d he adds.",
      "Ahh.",
      "Rioux, the world\u2019s tallest teenager, is one of top-seeded Florida\u2019s most popular players heading into the NCAA Tournament \u2014 even though he has to take the court. Photos. Videos. Autographs. Interviews. The attention is immense. The requests are worldwide.",
      "The 19-year-old Rioux handles them all as effortlessly as he touches a 10-foot rim and without anything in return. But the Canadian whose unusual height landed him a spot in the Guinness World Record is hoping to start earning money from use of his name, image and likeness in the United States.",
      "Rioux has formally applied for an 0-1 visa, which is reserved for individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement in fields of science, art, education, business or athletics.",
      "There\u2019s precedent for it in the NCAA, which provides limited opportunities for international students to capitalize on NIL while attending college in the U.S. Former Northwestern State and current Austin Peay guard Hansel Enmanuel of the Dominican Republic was granted that type of visa in 2022.",
      "Enmanuel\u2019s left arm was amputated just below the shoulder after an accident when he was 6; he is considered one of the most inspirational college basketball players because he helps countless kids dealing with physical limitations find hope.",
      "Enmanuel has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, 2.8 million on TikTok and has security at road games. He has lucrative NIL deals with Adidas, Gatorade, Oakley, T-Mobile and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson\u2019s ZOA Energy drink that total roughly $1.5 million, according to ESPN.",
      "Rioux\u2019s popularity is nowhere near that level right now. But it's expected to grow, especially when he starts playing. He's already a walking viral video; while coaches and teammates climbed a ladder to cut pieces of the nets after Florida won the Southeastern Conference Tournament on Sunday, Rioux was able to do it while standing flat-footed.",
      "\u201cI feel a bit strange about it because you see a lot of deals happening worth millions of dollars, which I\u2019m like, \u2018Dang, that\u2019s a lot of money,\u2019\u201d Rioux told The Associated Press. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ll be good.\u201d",
      "Rioux has a few future endeavors already in the works.",
      "At the launch party of Florida quarterback DJ Lagway\u2019s foundation last week, it was announced that Rioux would join Lagway on a future \u201c Gators at Sea Cruise.\u201d A two-person suite on the cruise sold for $3,000 during Lagway's charity auction.",
      "Rioux doesn\u2019t enjoy boats or anything else that can cause motion sickness. Rollercoasters are definitely out. And on a recent trip to Alabama, the Gators had to fly through storm-related turbulence. \u201cIt was iffy, and I did not like it,\u201d Rioux said.",
      "But he\u2019s going to suck it up for a few days on the open seas and plans to shoot a video series about it \u2014 \u201cOllie\u2019s Adventures\u201d has a nice ring.",
      "He\u2019s never been on a cruise, but he knows cabins usually don\u2019t have much space and doorways aren\u2019t designed for 7-footers \u2014 let alone someone closer to 8 feet tall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be funny,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "He does know this: a tryout with the Canadian national team awaits him following March Madness. He\u2019s excited to see how he performs after four-plus months focused on getting strong and improving his quickness. His on-court work, though, has been limited.",
      "Florida coach Todd Golden gave Rioux the choice of playing garbage-time minutes as a non-scholarship player this season or redshirting and saving a year of eligibility. Rioux chose the latter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d Rioux said. \u201cI feel good about it. I feel like I\u2019ve been doing a tremendous job in terms of lifting. Obviously, practicing is a bit different. You\u2019re not playing as much as you want to, but you still got to show up and practice as much as they want me to.\u201d",
      "Added Golden: \u201cHe\u2019s way more athletic now than when he got here, and we always thought of Ollie is kind of a longer-term project so to speak. \u2026 He\u2019s been incredibly coachable. He\u2019s done everything we\u2019ve asked him to do from a practice standpoint. I still feel good about his opportunity and his potential to become a good player.\u201d",
      "For now, though, he\u2019s a sizable side attraction. Fans line up to meet him after games, and he\u2019s always willing to pose for pictures or sign autographs. And the NCAA Tournament \u2014 the Gators open Friday against Norfolk State in Raleigh, North Carolina \u2014 will offer him a chance to reach new audiences and potentially line up future paydays.",
      "It might even include dancing with mascots.",

      "STORRS, Conn. -- Not long after seeing the path ahead in UConn's quest for a third consecutive national title, coach Dan Hurley was determined not to repeat the error of his ways.",
      "The last time the Huskies lost an NCAA Tournament game they had not gotten over a loss in the Big East tourney semifinals. Hurley and his staff walked the tightrope of addressing the miscues while trying to move on but UConn went out and lost its 2022 NCAA opener to New Mexico.",
      "The Huskies have won their last 12 games in the NCAA Tournament, putting them in position for a threepeat that hasn't been done since the early 1970s UCLA dynasty. The loss to Creighton in this year's Big East semis is forgotten.",
      "\u201cI am not going to make the same mistake I did in \u201922 when I let it linger too long,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do that.\u201d",
      "UConn will open this year's tourney against Oklahoma on Friday night in Raleigh. North Carolina, after a trying season that included a three-game skid at the Maui Invitational and no Big East titles. A team that opened at No. 3 in the preseason AP Top 25 eventually dropped out of the poll and it was clear that sustained success would be a grind for a roster that returned only one starter.",
      "While the journey was a bumpy one, the process did not change.",
      "\"(A third straight national title) is something that quite honestly, early in the year, it was something that was talked about around here,\" Hurley said. \"With the way that we played to this point, it is not something we are talking about. Right now, let\u2019s just get our best performance together and lock in on Oklahoma.\"",
      "If UConn and Florida meet in the second round, there will be plenty of references to the Gators, who were the last team to win back-to-back national titles (2006-07) before UConn. For now, the focus is squarely on Oklahoma.",
      "\u201cIt is March and you want to play your best basketball as a team and individually. I am trying to do everything in my power to help this team win,\u201d said UConn forward Alex Karaban, that lone returning starter.",
      "Karaban, Hassan Diarra and Samson Johnson are the only players who were members of the last two national championship teams. The trio got together to talk after a stunning loss at Seton Hall and a home defeat to Creighton. There were some moments of self-evaluation as they discussed what they could do to get the Huskies into position to make a run at another national title.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t had the year as a team that we wanted and we lost some games that we wish we could have back\u201d Karaban said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot together and we are all going through this as one unit. We are embracing the struggles and everything that has come with it.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy playing without star freshman Liam McNeeley for eight games or missing Karaban for two others. Diarra had to deal with an ankle injury for many late-season games. All three say they are healthy now.",
      "\u201cWe are holding up great,\u201d UConn sophomore guard Solo Ball said. \u201cHaving a tight-knit locker room helps a lot. When you have someone to go to on the team, those situations where you can go and talk to a teammate or a peer helps so much.\u201d",
      "That was never more evident than a win over Marquette on March 5 when Karaban drained a 3-pointer in the final minute to give the Huskies their fifth win of the season against a ranked team.",
      "\u201cThis year is different because we are still juggling a rotation and still trying to shore up some major vulnerabilities as a team,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cThe last two years we were just trying to keep our team sharp and confident. We were excellent at both ends of the court. We were deep, and we knew who was playing when.",
      "\u201cNow, we are still searching a little bit. We are still trying to find a better version of ourselves. We are trying to play a complete game. We are still looking for production and minutes at critical spots.\u201d",
      "UConn is a No. 8 seed in the West Region. The Huskies have won national titles as the West Regional champion before and not all of the six previous national titles began with the Huskies as a pre-tournament favorite.",
      "\u201cWe are all in it together because I don\u2019t think any of us coaches or players feel right now that if any of us walked away if the season ended now and be happy with the year that we had,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cWe are a group of people who are together in this.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The SEC was the best conference in basketball all season, landing a record 14 teams in the 68-team NCAA Tournament",
      "Porter Moser spent three seasons in the Big 12 before shepherding Oklahoma to the Southeastern Conference, making the longtime coach uniquely suited to compare the erstwhile best conference in America to the current king of college hoops.",
      "\u201cThe things is, there is no bottom,\u201d Moser explained. \u201cThat's what we felt in the Big 12 the last couple years. But the athleticism with the ages is the difference. The athleticism, in my opinion, I've never seen in any league in any era. The length, age, shooters, skill levels of the teams in the SEC this year \u2014 it's unbelievable. \u201d",
      "Unbelievable is a good way to describe Selection Sunday.",
      "The expanded SEC landed a record 14 teams in the 68-team bracket, populating it with the overall No. 1 seed (Auburn), another No. 1 seed (Florida) and four more among the top four seeds in their respective regions. The total was a full three more than the previous record, held by the Big East, back when it was considered the dominant league in the country.",
      "Buzz Williams was a part of that league, back when he was with Marquette. Then he moved to the ACC at Virginia Tech, which never seemed a whole lot easier. But these days? Every night, Williams knows his boys at Texas A&M are in for a fight.",
      "\u201cI do think what\u2019s transpiring is historic. And I don\u2019t think that when you\u2019re living in it, you\u2019re clapping as a fan or as a media member going, \u2018This is really cool,\u2019\u201d Williams said. \"You\u2019re trying to figure out how to not suffocate yourself from the burden that you feel that (every) possession can move the needle.\u201d",
      "So how exactly did the SEC reach this point? How did a league known for fall Saturdays in the South \u2014 the Iron Bowl, the Egg Bowl, the \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\u201d \u2014 become the epicenter of winters on the hardwood?",
      "A good place to start is 2016, when Greg Sankey took over as the commissioner. The SEC only landed three schools in the NCAA Tournament that year, and Sankey was unwilling to accept any excuses from coaches, athletic directors and administrators.",
      "One of his first calls was to Mike Tranghese, the old Big East commissioner, who came aboard as a consultant. The next was to Dan Leibovitz, a former coach with NBA ties, who became associate commissioner in charge of basketball. When Leibovitz took over the Big East, Sankey brought in Garth Glissman, who had been vice president of basketball operations for the NBA.",
      "In other words, Sankey brought in basketball minds to lead a basketball resurrection.",
      "Then, that group convinced schools that winning in football and basketball wasn't an either-or proposition. They could succeed in both of college athletics' most lucrative games, provided they did a few seemingly simple things:",
      "\u2014 They invested in them. More than half of the teams in the current 16-team configuration have built new arenas or undertaken transformative renovations since Sankey was hired, and others have invested in player dormitories and practice facilities.",
      "\u2014 They hired the right coaches and paid them well. The common denominator has been track records as winning head coaches, either in other power conferences \u2014 such as Rick Barnes at Tennessee and Chris Beard at Ole Miss \u2014 or from the mid-major level, such as Missouri's Dennis Gates, Todd Golden at Florida, Nate Oats at Alabama and Mississippi State's Chris Jans.",
      "\u2014 They recruited the right players, transfers and freshmen alike. Three of the league's biggest stars got their start elsewhere: Auburn's Johni Broome at Morehead State, Florida's Walter Clayton Jr. at Iona and Alabama's Mark Sears at Ohio. Looking ahead to next season, 14 of the league's 16 teams have at least one top-100 freshman recruit.",
      "The coaches have managed to navigate a brave new world of the transfer portal and name, image and likeness compensation in college sports, keeping their best players with proper packages while bringing in others with robust support from alumni and administrators.",
      "\u201cWhen Vandebilt wins, it strengthens our connection to the university and to each other, as alumni and supports,\u201d said Mark H. Carter, a businessman who recently pledged a $1.5 million matching gift to the school to support NIL initiatives.",
      "\u201cIf we, in turn, invest in recruiting and holding onto the best of the best, we can do great things for the university,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWhen the whole world is watching Vanderbilt, the return on investment is exponential.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Vanderbilt received its first NCAA Tournament bid in eight years. The Commodores deserved it, too, beating the likes of Seton Hall (Big East), Virginia Tech and Cal (ACC) and TCU (Big 12).",
      "It is hard to argue the SEC did not deserve its 14 tournament bids when you consider its teams combined to go 30-4 against the ACC, 14-2 against the Big 12, 10-9 against the Big Ten and 5-4 against the Big East.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a record non-conference success rate for all the teams in our league,\u201d Ole Miss coach Chris Beard said. \u201cThen when the league starts, it's just been a bloodbath. It's short-term memory. Two-game winning streak and free breakfast burritos in the morning; lose a couple games and fans think the world's falling apart.\u201d",
      "The only two SEC teams that missed the NCAA Tournament were LSU and South Carolina. The Tigers beat NCAA teams Arkansas and Oklahoma, while the Gamecocks beat the Razorbacks and fellow NCAA qualifier Texas.",
      "\u201cThere's no alpha in this league,\u201d said Dylan Caldwell, who helped Auburn spend eight weeks at No. 1 this season. \u201cWe were like, maybe five or six possessions away from being the 5-seed, you know?\u201d",
      "Indeed, there is certainly an alpha in college basketball.",
      "\u201cEvery single game that you play in this conference is an elite-level game,\u201d explained Kentucky guard Kobe Brea. \"You're playing against a really good team. Their whole roster is really good. Obviously, they're coached by good coaches.",
      "\u201cThe SEC has just been different this year,\u201d Brea said. \u201cI think it's been an historic year, actually, for any conference.\u201d",

      "Skrmetti and a handful of attorneys general had sued the NCAA over its name, image and likeness recruiting ban, arguing the rule violated antitrust laws.",

      "Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a little extra zip on his fastball",
      "TOKYO -- Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a little extra zip on his fastball. Shohei Ohtani even admitted to some nerves.",
      "There was little doubt this was no ordinary baseball game.",
      "But the Japanese players who were playing in front of their home country at the Tokyo Dome on Tuesday night handled any jitters they had quite well, delivering in clutch moments as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-1 in Major League Baseball's season opener.",
      "\u201cI was actually pretty nervous,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter. \"It\u2019s been a while since I was nervous, but today, definitely felt it.\u201d",
      "Ohtani finished with two hits in the Dodgers' win, including a single in the fifth and a double in the ninth. Both hard-hit balls brought roars from the roughly 42,000 fans at a packed Tokyo Dome and were instrumental in helping the Dodgers get off to a good start this season.",
      "\u201cI don't think I've ever seen Shohei nervous,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cOne thing I did notice is how emotional he got during the Japanese national anthem. That was something very telling.\u201d",
      "Yamamoto pitched five quality innings to earn the win, giving up just one run on three hits and a walk while striking out four. The right-hander's fastball touched 98 mph and consistently sat in the 96-97 range, which is a few ticks higher than last year.",
      "It was the first time Yamamoto had been on the mound in a regular season game since his fantastic performance in Game 2 of the World Series, and the results carried over to the Tokyo Dome",
      "\u201cWhat I experienced in October, I learned a lot of things,\u201d Yamamoto said through a translator. \u201cWhat I should and what I shouldn't do in certain situations. Based on that, I feel more confident.\u201d",
      "Yamamoto said he wasn't trying to overthrow on his fastball. Instead, he said better mechanics have allowed him to throw a little harder. Roberts said there's no reason the 26-year-old can't compete for the NL Cy Young award if he pitches like he did against the Cubs and stays healthy.",
      "\u201cGreat outing, I thought he commanded the baseball really well tonight,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe fastball was as good as we've seen. Competed really well. There was some soft contact in there and he just navigated the game really well.\u201d",
      "Even in a losing effort, Cubs left-hander Shota Imanaga was fantastic through four scoreless innings, giving up no hits while walking four. The Imanaga vs. Yamamoto matchup was the first all-Japanese starting pitching duel on opening day in MLB history.",
      "\u201cImanaga and Yamamoto did a really good job handling the nerves of the start of the game,\u201d Cubs manager Craig Counsell said.",
      "Imanaga said he was pleased with his outing, even if the final result wasn't what he wanted. The lefty retired Ohtani twice, once on a groundout and another time on a lineout. He said the experience from Tuesday's game should serve him well throughout the season.",
      "\u201cOne of the lessons regarding the fastball was it felt really good,\u201d Imanaga said through an interpreter. \u201cOnce I go back to the US \u2014 obviously there's differences in humidity, environment and how far the ball goes \u2014 but bottom line if I can throw the fastball I did today all the time and have confidence in it, I'll be good.\u201d",
      "The only Japanese player who had a quiet night was Cubs slugger Seiya Suzuki, who finished 0 for 4 at the plate. With a runner on second in the eighth inning, he hit the ball fairly hard, but Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was there to snag the line drive.",
      "Japanese rookie Roki Sasaki will make his MLB debut on Wednesday night when the teams meet against at the Tokyo Dome for the finale of the two-game set.",

      "The only question is whether she wants to turn pro now or hold off for one more year.",
      "Bueckers, a fifth-year senior guard, still has one more year of eligibility remaining if she wants to remain at UConn. Azzi Fudd, her UConn teammate and another potential first-round pick, will face a similar decision at the end of UConn\u2019s NCAA Tournament run.",
      "Bueckers arrived at UConn in 2020 amid huge expectations and responded by emerging as the consensus national player of the year pick her freshman season. She played just 17 games the following season and missed the entire 2022-23 campaign with a torn anterior cruciate ligament but has since responded with two straight banner seasons.",
      "Now she has a chance to win the national title that has eluded her thus far. The 6-foot guard from Hopkins, Minnesota, has averaged 19 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2 steals this season while helping UConn (31-3) win 10 straight games. UConn (31-3) is a No. 2 seed and hosts Arkansas State (21-10) Saturday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on her, there\u2019s a lot of demands on her from a lot of different sources,\u201d UConn coach Geno Auriemma told reporters after Bueckers won her third Big East Tournament most outstanding player award. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy weight to carry around everywhere you go. It can be demoralizing at times. No matter what you do, more is expected from you. For her to be able to constantly come up with these kinds of performances time and time again, she just has that thing that those kinds of players have.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some other players in this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament who figure to get taken early in next month\u2019s WNBA draft:",
      "First-round game: Saturday vs. UNC Greensboro.",
      "Notes: After averaging a double-double (19.4 points, 11 rebounds) for Stanford last season, Iriafen transferred to USC (28-3) and had similar production with 18.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. The 6-foot-3 forward is shooting 49.9% this season after making over 53% of her shots each of her three years at Stanford, but she\u2019s continued to show why she\u2019s one of the top draft-eligible frontcourt players.",
      "First-round game: Friday vs. Stephen F. Austin.",
      "Notes: Miles missed the entire 2023-24 season with a knee injury but returned as a more complete player. The 5-10 guard had made just 24.6% of her career 3-point attempts before the injury. She\u2019s making 40.9% of her attempts from beyond the arc this season. Miles already had made quite an impression on scouts with her playmaking ability. Her improved shooting makes here even more appealing. Miles isn\u2019t the only player from Notre Dame (26-5) who figures to get selected early in the draft. Sonia Citron also is a likely first-round pick.",
      "First-round game: Friday vs. San Diego State.",
      "Notes: After putting up big numbers at DePaul her first two seasons, Morrow has maintained similar production while playing with more talent around her at LSU (28-5) the last couple seasons. The 6-1 forward has 13.6 rebounds per game to lead all Division I players and also has 18.5 points per game. She was a first-team all-Southeastern Conference selection who also made the league\u2019s al-defense team. Morrow has averaged at least 2.5 steals each season.",
      "First-round game: Friday vs. Tennessee Tech.",
      "Notes: Paopao is in her second season at South Carolina (30-3) after playing three seasons at Oregon. South Carolina coach Dawn Staley has referred to the 5-9 Paopao as an \u201celevator\u201d because she elevates the entire team. Paopao is averaging a career-low 9.8 points this season, but she has 1,692 career points and has showcased her shooting ability by making 40% of her career 3-point attempts.",
      "First-round game: Saturday vs. Vermont.",
      "Notes: Rivers certainly impressed WNBA scouts last month when she collected 14 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists as N.C. State (26-6) pulled out a 104-95 double-overtime victory over a then-No. 1 Notre Dame team featuring the star-studded backcourt of Miles and Hannah Hidalgo. Rivers has averaged 11.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.6 assists this season to earn first-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference honors alongside teammate Aziaha James, a WNBA prospect in her own right. The 6-1 Rivers is four inches taller than James, which could enable her to get drafted earlier.",
      "First-round game: Saturday vs. Norfolk State.",
      "Notes: Sellers has been a first-team all-Big Ten selection from the league\u2019s media each of the last three seasons and has earned that honor from the league\u2019s coaches for two straight seasons. The 6-2 senior is the first player in Maryland history to have 1,500 career points along with 500 rebounds and 500 assists. She has 14.1 points per game for the Terrapins (23-7) this season after averaging 15.6 last season and 13.9 in 2022-23. She also is shooting a career-best 44.4% from 3-point range.",

      "Moscow said in its recap of the call that Trump supported Putin\u2019s idea to organize games in the U.S. and Russia involving players from the NHL and the KHL, and agreed to remain in contact on all issues raised on the call, which was scheduled to discuss the war in Ukraine. The White House's report of the call did not mention talks involving hockey, and the NHL learned of the idea after it was over.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",

      "The call is Trump's latest foray into the sport after calling in to speak to the U.S. team at the 4 Nations Face-Off last month before the final, which ended in a 3-2 overtime loss to Canada. The U.S. anthem was booed in Montreal during the international tournament after Trump's repeated comments about making Canada \u201cthe 51st state\u201d and tariffs that have triggered a trade war between the North American neighbors.",
      "Putin's love of hockey as his favorite sport is widely known. He attended the Russia-U.S. preliminary round game at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, famously won in a shootout by American T.J. Oshie.",
      "The countries' rivalry on the ice dates to the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d when an underdog group of U.S. amateurs beat the heavily favored Soviet Union in the medal round on the way to capturing Olympic gold in Lake Placid, New York.",
      "The Russians, playing as the Olympic Athletes from Russia because of previous doping violations, won men's hockey gold at the Games in 2018 when the NHL did not participate for the first time since 1994.",
      "Russia has been banned by the International Ice Hockey Federation for all tournaments the organization runs since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A decision has not yet been reached about the 2026 Milan Olympics, with NHL players returning, though the International Olympic Committee did not allow Russian teams to take part last summer in Paris, permitting only individual athletes as neutral competitors.",
      "The NHL has continued to allow Russian players in their league, most prominently Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals as he chases down Wayne Gretzky's career goals record. Some of the most talented players in the league are from Russia, including Tampa Bay goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy and forward Nikita Kucherov and Minnesota's Kirill Kaprizov.",
      "The NHL Players' Association and league have plans to hold a World Cup of Hockey in 2028, though it is unclear if Russians will be part of it.",
      "\u201cRussia has a great hockey tradition. We have great Russian players playing in our league,\u201d Commissioner Gary Bettman said at the 4 Nations in Montreal. \u201cThe International Ice Hockey Federation just voted to keep Russia out of competitions, as have many of sports, and we\u2019re going to have to see what the International Olympic Committee does. But we have enough time to deal with the realities of what the world situation looks like before that.\u201d",
      "Union executive director Marty Walsh said members from Russia he has spoken to want to be able to represent their country again on the world stage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see our Russian players playing in the tournaments again,\u201d Walsh said last month. \u201cThey are incredible hockey players. The issues are political.

      "Canada's new leader has announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada\u2019s far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region",
      "IQALUIT, Nunavut -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada's far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region.",
      "The prime minister's office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201c\u201cCanada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",
      "\u201cThis will be a significant export if this deal is finalized,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "Albanese had a phone call with Carney the prior night.",
      "\u201cObviously, there are issues taking place, particularly between Canada and the United States, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to have been happening in my lifetime,\" Albanese said.",
      "Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney's plane before the announcement, said the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries.",
      "But the officials said they couldn't say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Carney also announced the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada\u2019s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. He said Canada will have a \u201cgreater sustained year-round presence.\u201d",
      "The prime minister\u2019s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cThe United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.",
      "The president is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products and has already placed them on steel and aluminum.",
      "Carney and Trump have not spoken since Carney was elected as the new Liberal party leader and prime minister more than a week ago. Carney said at the \u201cappropriate time\u201d he will have a discussion with the U.S. president, as \u201ctwo sovereign nations, that is comprehensive and not targeted at one issue.\u201d",
      "But Trump keeps disrespecting Canada, saying twice on Fox News on Tuesday night that that \u201cCanada was meant to be the 51st state.\"",
      "He said that's why he's he's tougher on his neighbor than America's biggest adversaries.",
      "Trump also repeated several times that he didn't care that the Liberals might win the Canadian election now.",
      "\u201cThe Conservative that\u2019s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don\u2019t know, but he said negative things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, when he says negative things, I couldn\u2019t care less. I think it\u2019s easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d",
      "Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",
      "For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations. Several of the dignitaries, including Carney when he was head of Canada\u2019s central bank, went dogsledding in subfreezing temperatures.",
      "It is a distinctive destination \u2014 home to about 7,500 people but not a single traffic light \u2014 with no road or rail links to the outside world.",
      "Increasing international tensions, global warming and the changing world economy have put the Arctic at the heart of the debate over global trade and security.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.",
      "The problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.",
      "The email pleaded for help.",
      "\u201cHis behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,\u201d the email said, according to The Sunday Times. \u201cI remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.\u201d The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.",
      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore\u2019s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.",
      "Williams\u2019 husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.",
      "Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can\u2019t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.",
      "Wilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space station's internet phone.",
      "Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.",
      "Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they're back, according to NASA.",
      "\u201cEvery astronaut that launches into space, we teach them don't think about when you're coming home. Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",
      "SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that's been up there since last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,\u201d Bowersox said, describing the pair as \u201cprofessional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.\u201d",
      "Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing's Starliner and will return in SpaceX's Dragon.",
      "Their first flights were aboard NASA's space shuttle, followed by Russia's Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.",
      "As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Starliner almost didn't make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.",
      "NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.",
      "Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it's unclear when Starliner will fly again \u2014 with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy's sake and stand by that choice.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "Iguanas may have pulled off a 5000 mile voyage on a raft of floating vegetation to get to Fiji",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji, a collection of remote islands in the South Pacific. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas \u2014 thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.",
      "They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.",
      "But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas pulled off the 5,000 mile (8,000 kilometer) odyssey on a raft of floating vegetation \u2014 masses of uprooted trees and small plants. That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",
      "The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other tidbits about where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America.",
      "\u201cGiven what we know now, their result is by far the most strongly supported,\u201d said Kevin de Queiroz, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot.",

      "Hospitals say AI is helping their nurses work more efficiently while addressing burnout and understaffing. But nursing unions argue that this poorly understood technology is overriding nurses' expertise and degrading the quality of care patients receive.",
      "\u201cHospitals have been waiting for the moment when they have something that appears to have enough legitimacy to replace nurses,\u201d said Michelle Mahon of National Nurses United. \u201cThe entire ecosystem is designed to automate, de-skill and ultimately replace caregivers.\u201d",
      "Mahon\u2019s group, the largest nursing union in the U.S., has helped organize more than 20 demonstrations at hospitals across the country, pushing for the right to have say in how AI can be used \u2014 and protection from discipline if they decide to disregard automated advice. The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses \u201cas good as any doctor\u201d could help deliver care in rural areas. On Friday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who\u2019s been nominated to oversee Medicare and Medicaid, said he believes AI can \u201cliberate doctors and nurses from all the paperwork.\u201d",

It has since dropped that language, instead touting its services and seeking to assure customers that they have been carefully tested. The company did not grant requests for an interview.",
      "Hospitals have been experimenting for years with technology designed to improve care and streamline costs, including sensors, microphones and motion-sensing cameras. Now that data is being linked with electronic medical records and analyzed in an effort to predict medical problems and direct nurses' care \u2014 sometimes before they've evaluated the patient themselves.",
      "Adam Hart was working in the emergency room at Dignity Health in Henderson, Nevada, when the hospital's computer system flagged a newly arrived patient for sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to infection. Under the hospital's protocol, he was supposed to immediately administer a large dose of IV fluids. But after further examination, Hart determined that he was treating a dialysis patient, or someone with kidney failure. Such patients have to be carefully managed to avoid overloading their kidneys with fluid.",
      "Hart raised his concern with the supervising nurse but was told to just follow the standard protocol. Only after a nearby physician intervened did the patient instead begin to receive a slow infusion of IV fluids.",
      "\u201cYou need to keep your thinking cap on\u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re being paid as a nurse,\u201d Hart said. \u201cTurning over our thought processes to these devices is reckless and dangerous.\u201d",
      "Hart and other nurses say they understand the goal of AI: to make it easier for nurses to monitor multiple patients and quickly respond to problems. But the reality is often a barrage of false alarms, sometimes erroneously flagging basic bodily functions \u2014 such as a patient having a bowel movement \u2014 as an emergency.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to focus on your work but then you\u2019re getting all these distracting alerts that may or may not mean something,\u201d said Melissa Beebe, a cancer nurse at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even tell when it\u2019s accurate and when it\u2019s not because there are so many false alarms.\u201d",

      "More than 100,000 nurses left the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to one estimate, the biggest staffing drop in 40 years. As the U.S. population ages and nurses retire, the U.S. government estimates there will be more than 190,000 new openings for nurses every year through 2032.",

Nurses confirm information about prescriptions, heart conditions and other issues \u2014 like sleep apnea \u2014 that must be carefully reviewed before anesthesia.",

It also has testing projects going in Valence, France, and at the Zurich airport.",
      "Pau Cugat was one of the curious to step aboard for a short ride along Passeig de Gracia boulevard.",
      "\u201cWe just passed by a regular, combustion-engine city bus, and I thought, \u2018Look, there is a bus of the past, and right behind it you have the bus of the future,\u2019\u201d the 18-year-old student said.",
      "Driverless taxis and buses are being tried out by companies in other cities, from San Francisco to Tokyo.",
      "But Renault\u2019s initiative comes as Europe generally lags behind the United States and China in driverless vehicle technology, where companies are fiercely competing to get ahead.",
      "\u201cThe US is doing a lot of experimentation with autonomous vehicles, the same thing in China,\u201d Patrick Vergelas, head of Renault's autonomous mobility projects, told The Associated Press. \u201cUntil now we don\u2019t have a lot in fact in Europe. And this is why we want to show that this works and prepare Europe to this route in public transportation.\u201d",
      "The electric bus can run for 120 kilometers without a recharge and reach 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph). It is equipped with 10 cameras and eight lidars (sensor arrays) to help it navigate the streets filled with cars, motorbikes and pedestrians. The company says the bus is able to drive safely on a given course through a busy downtown like that of bustling Barcelona.",
      "Carlos Santos, of Renault\u2019s autonomous driving group, said that he has seen all types of reactions from riders.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of behaviors of people. Some of them were smiling, (while) other people just start crying, taking photographs or even try to open the doors,\" Santos said before he insisted that the bus ride was a safe one.",

      "ROME -- The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to the hospital, the most serious suffering contusions after part of a ceiling collapsed, officials said.",
      "The quake was the strongest in recorded history around the Phlegrean Fields, a sprawling area of ancient volcanoes that covers a broad swath of the Naples metropolitan area. It matched the magnitude of another quake in the same area last May that has put the population on alert.",
      "Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.",
      "The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples.

      "On Tuesday at 5:57 pm EDT, SpaceX Dragon Freedom splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida, carrying Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Butch Wilmore along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "It was an idyllic day for a return to Earth Tuesday, with the astronauts splashing down to 78 degrees Fahrenheit weather. A pod of curious dolphins was also seen swimming around the capsule as ground crews were preparing the capsule to be opened after landing.",
      "The capsule was eventually brought out of the water and placed on a recovery ship where the astronauts finally got to have their first breath of fresh air in over nine months.",
      "Williams and Wilmore had in June 2024 performed the first astronaut-crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule. What was expected to be a weeklong trip to the ISS instead turned into a nine-month stay. The Boeing Starliner that was expected to carry them home after about 10 days experienced issues, leaving the pair at the station for months.",
      "Early Tuesday morning, the SpaceX Dragon carrying Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov undocked autonomously from the ISS at 1:05 a.m. ET and began its 17-hour journey back to Earth.",
      "As the Dragon separated from the ISS, the Crew-9 and ISS astronauts shared farewells and well wishes over the radio. Dragon commander Nick Hague told the ISS crew, \"On behalf of Crew-9, I'd like to say it was a privilege to call station home. To live and work and be a part of a mission and a team that spans the globe working together in cooperation for the benefit of humanity.\"",
      "Their return spacecraft maneuvered in space, moving above and behind the station, before firing a series of departure burns that sent it back toward Earth.",
      "After it completed its journey from the ISS and prepared for re-entry, the Dragon performed a deorbit burn using its Draco thrusters to change the vehicle's course and put it on the proper path for re-entering Earth's atmosphere and landing at the designated location off the coast of Florida.",
      "After the burn, the Dragon began its re-entry, a period where the spacecraft is subjected to extreme heat, up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit and drag. To keep the astronauts safe, Dragon employs a heat shield to keep it from burning up during re-entry. The drag helped slow down the vehicle, so it was safe to deploy its parachutes.",
      "Dragon then used two sets of parachutes to slow it down further before splashing down.",
      "The first two drogue chutes, also called drag chutes, are designed for high speeds and were deployed at approximately 18,000 feet while the craft traveled at nearly 350 miles per hour.",
      "That slowed down the vehicle significantly but not enough for a safe landing. At about 6,000 feet, the four main parachutes deployed successfully and slowed the spacecraft to a safe 15 miles per hour before it splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee.",

    "story": [
      "Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement defending the judiciary.",
      "President Donald Trump continued Tuesday to rail against the federal judge who issued an order stopping deportation flights of noncitizens to other countries under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\u201cMany people have called for his impeachment, the impeachment of this judge. I don't know who the judge is, but he's radical left,\" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham in an excerpt from an interview that will air later Tuesday. \"He was Obama-appointed, and he actually said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders, that we shouldn't be allowed to take them out of our country.\"",
      "\"Well, that's a presidential job that's not for a local judge to be making that determination,\u201d Trump said, echoing the argument other members of his administration have made since U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his order on Saturday to stop deportation flights.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to push back against calls from Trump and some House Republicans to impeach judges whose rulings conflicted with the Trump administration's deportation plans.",
      "Roberts issued his rare statement after Trump hurled insults at the federal judge who conducted a fact-finding hearing on Monday over whether the Trump administration knowingly violated a court order when it handed over more than 200 alleged gang members to El Salvadoran authorities over the weekend.",
      "In a post on his social media network on Tuesday morning, Trump called Boasberg \"crooked\" and said he should be impeached.",
      "\"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\" Trump wrote. \"WE DON'T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY.\"",
      "While he didn't mention Trump or the specific judge by name, Roberts rebuked Trump's call for impeaching members of the judiciary.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Trump brushed off Roberts' criticism, saying, \"\u201cHe didn't mention my name in the statement. I just saw it quickly. He didn't mention my name.\"",
      "Roberts' statement signals a stark difference in opinion between the judicial and executive branches.",
      "Republican freshman Rep. Brandon Gill of Texas filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg on Tuesday. Five other GOP lawmakers signed on as a co-sponsors of the bill, though House GOP leaders have not said yet if they plan to hold a vote on the impeachment articles.",
      "Congress can impeach a judge if a simple majority is reached in the House. If the articles were taken up and ultimately clear the House, the Senate would need to hold a trial. It would require a two-thirds majority vote in the upper chamber to convict a judge.",
      "It's rare, but not unprecedented, for members of Congress to file articles of impeachment against a judge.",
      "In February, GOP Rep. Eli Crane filed articles of impeachment against U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who issued a sweeping restriction on the Department of Government Efficiency's access to sensitive Department of Treasury payment systems. More than a dozen judges have been impeached in U.S. history and only a handful have been convicted.",
      "Trump argued on Tuesday that he should not be prevented from carrying out his immigration agenda, saying in his social media post, \"I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do.\"",
      "Trump's comments about Boasberg came after the federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deporting any noncitizens after the president's recent proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Boasberg, in verbal instructions during a hearing on Saturday, gave orders to immediately turn around two planes carrying noncitizens if they are covered by his order, including one that potentially took off during a break in the court's hearing. However, sources said top lawyers and officials in the administration made the determination that since the flights were over international waters, Boasberg's order did not apply, and the planes were not turned around.",
      "On Monday, Boasberg questioned whether the Trump administration ignored his orders to turn the planes around, saying it was \"heck of a stretch\" for them to argue that his order could be disregarded.",
      "Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli argued Monday during the \"fact-finding\" hearing convened by Boasberg that the judge's directive on Saturday evening to turn around the flights did not take effect until it was put in writing later that evening.",
      "Boasberg ordered the Justice Department to submit, by noon Tuesday, a sworn declaration of what they represented in a filing Monday -- that a third flight that took off after his written order on Saturday carried detainees who were removable on grounds other than the Alien Enemies Act.",

      "John Roberts responded after Trump called for a federal judge to be impeached.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts doesn't use social media, much less follow President Donald Trump on his online platform Truth Social.",
      "But when Trump posted an attack on a federal judge just after 9 a.m. Tuesday, calling for his impeachment after an adverse ruling, Roberts took the extraordinary step of issuing a statement with equally extraordinary speed.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in a statement released to ABC News just before noon. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "While Roberts didn't mention Trump or the specific judge by name, the rebuke was squarely aimed at the president, his senior adviser Elon Musk and congressional Republican allies who have called for the removal of district court judges who block, temporarily or otherwise, any administration action.",
      "Trump had singled out U.S. District Court Judge Jeb Boasberg, who days earlier had ordered the administration to temporarily halt deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. Boasberg was seeking information on the detainees, who were arrested and removed without any due process under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government continued the flights anyway and is currently appealing Boasberg's order. Trump nonetheless asserted the judge should be removed. \"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President,\" Trump wrote on social media.",
      "The public exchange between the heads of two branches of American government thrust into the spotlight Roberts' apparently growing concern about eroding respect for rule of law.",
      "The chief justice -- who heads the nation's federal judiciary -- rarely speaks in public and almost never comments on partisan debate, much less responds to a politician in real time over a dispute he will likely be asked to review.",
      "The court as an institution prizes its independence and its members, appointed for life, have historically maintained strict silence on active legal disputes they could resolve.",
      "That Roberts chose to respond at this moment is an indication of the seriousness of his concern about the current relationship between this White House and the courts.",
      "Just days before Trump was sworn in a second time, Roberts warned of precisely the types of attacks on judges now proliferating.",
      "\"Within the past few years, elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,\" Roberts wrote in his annual report on the judiciary, just days before Trump was sworn in for a second time. \"These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.\"",
      "\"Every Administration suffers defeats in the court system -- sometimes in cases with major ramifications for executive or legislative power or other consequential topics,\" Roberts wrote. \"Nevertheless, for the past several decades, the decisions of the courts, popular or not, have been followed.\"",
      "Allies of the president note that, for all his bluster, he never openly flouted a federal court ruling during his first term in office.",
      "\"I always abide by the courts, always abide by them. And we'll appeal,\" Trump said last month from the Oval Office. But he has also shown openness to a different approach: \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" he later posted on social media.",
      "Legal scholars say recent rhetoric from the Trump administration has brought the nation to the brink of a constitutional crisis -- a moment when the democratic system of government, with three independent branches providing a check on the others, fails to function properly.",
      "\"There's a centuries-old understanding that if the impeachment power is used to punish judges for their rulings, it undermines the vital independence of the judicial branch,\" wrote Douglas Keith, a constitutional scholar and attorney with the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan legal advocacy group.",
      "In 2018, Roberts and Trump famously clashed in public over a similar scenario: a district court judge blocking a Trump immigration policy.",
      "\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts wrote in a Thanksgiving Day statement. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"",
      "Trump at the time shot back: \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.\"",
      "Trump has challenged the courts in ways not other modern president has, loudly and personally attacking judges, their family members and staff, often by name.",
      "It remains a striking phenomenon of this presidency.",

      "\"I think she's done at the top of the ticket.\" said one donor, who like several other donors, spoke with ABC News on the condition of anonymity because they are still actively involved in Democratic party fundraising. He added, \"I think the country will not have moved in a progressive direction during that time, it will have become more conservative.\"",
      "The donor was one of the over 20 donors that ABC News spoke with from Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who supported Harris as a junior senator, during the most crowded Democratic presidential race in history, and remained unified during her 2024 bid.",
      "The support Harris spent years cultivating faces deep fissures.",
      "Another donor, Areva Martin, who has known Harris since college, said Harris has a history of quieting the doubters.",

      "Case for Harris running for governor",
      "Nearly every member of Harris' 2019 National Finance Committee who spoke with ABC News backed her for a gubernatorial run.",
      "Harris' aides previously told ABC News she will make a decision by the end of summer. Some supporters see a successful Harris bid for governor in 2026 as a dealbreaker to run for president in 2028, because of the short window between a gubernatorial inauguration and a potential presidential launch.",
      "Bakari Sellers, former co-chair of Harris' 2020 campaign, said, \"If she wants to run for governor, I don't think the Katie Porter's of the world are formidable.

      "Only one donor who spoke with ABC News said he was not enthusiastic about supporting Harris for governor.",
      "\"If she even thinks of running for president, it will be very bad. If she even puts feelers out it will be embarrassing,\" he said, adding, he would need to be convinced to write big checks for her for any race.",
      "He claimed donors struggled after Harris' presidential loss to get answers from staffers, \"I don't want to deal with her campaign apparatus.\"",

      "\"The Democratic party is well known for killing their losers and finding someone else,\" said one donor.",
      "\"I think losing to Donald Trump is the cardinal sin of the Democratic party. The left and people that supported her don't appear to be trying to articulate that this loss was narrow and her ideas were popular,\" said one loyalist.",
      "\"It's tough for anyone to come back from a loss and run again. Trump is, of course, an exception. In my opinion, I don't think she would get significant support as a presidential nominee.\" Dr. Manan Trivedi, a donor and former candidate for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district, told ABC News.",
      "Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Grover Cleveland, Richard Nixon, Trump were all presidential nominees who lost before winning a general election. Grover Cleveland was the only Democrat to accomplish the feat.",
      "Some donors were skeptical of Harris joining that list.",
      "\"If Kamala wanted to be president of the United States, she needed to position herself as the leader of the resistance. Not only has she not done that but no other leader has pushed themselves forward,\" said one donor.",
      "Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija met Harris during her 2010 attorney general run and said he believes Democrats have time to better position themselves for a successful presidential run.",
      "\"I think she has the luxury of not having to dive into the political fray during this time. By focusing on the human impact of what this administration is doing. It could draw on her strength as an empathetic leader. It could make a difference in these interim years,\" Makhija told ABC News.",
      "Another donor said Democrats need to be strategic.",
      "\"I want to win. I am not supporting a woman, a Black person, or a gay person. I am supporting the non-threatening white dude. Even if a woman were the best candidate, I would have a hard time until it became really clear that there is a real pathway,\" said one female donor.",
      "Democratic bundler Alex Heckler said he has remained a big fan of Harris' but fears Democrats are playing a defensive game.",
      "While he says he's happy with the new party chair, he says, \"Democrats over-correct. Three white men led the votes for party chair - it's ridiculous. We can't help ourselves. I struggle being a Democrat these days.\"",
      "\"Democrats are reactionary - they think two women lost - we can't put a woman up again,\" Heckler said.",
      "Activist Tina Duryea said she's also frustrated with the party.",
      "\"She [Harris] could run on: 'look how miserable everything is now you could have had me' that could be a very powerful message. I don't have a lot of tolerance for people living in fear. Democrats overthink things,\" Duryea told ABC News. She said she's \"100% behind\" any decision Harris makes.",
      "Rapidly changing political landscape",
      "Like any voter, donors change their minds about politics. Multiple did during the course of this reporting.",
      "Two weeks ago, one prominent donor said, \"I don't think she has it in her,\" adding he believed the next democratic nominee \"will be one of the governors.\"",
      "But the donor changed his mind after Harris' recent appearances. \"Putting your heart and soul into an election is devastating. Watching her [Harris] over the last few weeks, she seems to be getting her legs back. She's been out there speaking,\" the donor said.",
      "He added, \"If the world is falling apart economically and geopolitically and she gets a head start on fundraising, with her name recognition and leadership, she could easily become the frontrunner and win.\"",
      "Others acknowledged their positions could change.",
      "California donor Mark Buell said he is watching how California's gubernatorial and the presidential races unfold before he publicly endorses anyone.",
      "\"I've learned my lesson, you have to wait to be able to see the full landscape. \u2026We have many issues in this country. If I have to hold my nose to vote for a Democratic who I don't like but think would win - I would. It's not who my favorite is or who I love.\"",
      "Another donor cited a possible fundamental change in American democracy, led by Trump's actions.",
      "\"I am very reluctant to back a horse. Because I'm not even sure we're horse racing anymore,\" he said.",

      "Like several other donors, Janni Lehrer-Stein, a longtime Harris donor and disability advocate, said she has seen Harris multiple times since the election, and has not received any indication as to what she plans to do in the future, but said, \"Kamala Harris is going to lead us toward justice and a better life for everyone.

      "Several of the 31 actions announced by the agency last week targeted prior regulations meant to restrict emissions and pollution related to the use of coal. Chief among these was the announcement to \"reconsider\" President Joe Biden's \"Clean Power Plan 2.0,\" which was a group of regulations targeting coal and natural gas power plants announced last year.",
      "The \"Clean Power Plan 2.0\" tightened the emissions standards for coal-fired power plants for toxic metals like mercury and forced plants to control and clean coal ash released during their operations. But during his campaign, Trump spoke favorably about using more coal to power America's energy needs.",
      "On Monday, Trump called for an immediate expansion of coal production on Truth Social, writing, \"After years of being held captive by Environmental Extremists, Lunatics, Radicals, and Thugs, allowing other Countries, in particular China, to gain tremendous Economic advantage over us by opening up hundreds of all Coal Fire Power Plants, I am authorizing my Administration to immediately begin producing Energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.\"",
      "Coal is an abundant, energy-dense resource with a higher concentration in the U.S. than any other country in the world, but it is also a fossil fuel and creates carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) when burned, which contributes to global warming and human-amplified climate change. Coal emissions can also lead to health issues, including respiratory illness, lung disease, acid rain, smog, and neurological and developmental damage.",
      "While coal-fired electricity has become \"cleaner than ever,\" according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the fossil fuel is still responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions and environment-polluting coal ash. So \"clean coal\" is a bit of a misnomer, sometimes referring to types of technology used to physically clean coal before it is burned or capture carbon related to its burning, according to Michelle Solomon, senior policy analyst at Energy Innovation.",
      "\"Burning coal could never be technically considered clean regardless of the treatment applied to it before combustion \u2013 it will always emit the largest concentration of greenhouse gases of any fossil fuel, and soil and water pollution from coal and coal ash (what's left after it's burned) will never go away,\" Solomon said. \"Even the best technologies that reduce air pollutants like sulfur and nitrogen oxides still allow many of these to get through.\"",
      "These technologies are also not widely used in the U.S. According to a December 2023 report from the Congressional Budget Office, 15 carbon capture and storage facilities are operating in the United States. And none of them are being used at coal-burning power plants. The CBO also found that the 15 facilities can capture \"0.4% of percent of the United States' total annual emissions of CO2.\"",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the most significant factor in recent reductions of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. has been the decline in coal usage. In 2022, coal-fired electricity generation was largely replaced by other sources, primarily natural gas and renewables. As the production of cleaner alternatives continues to grow, the reliance on coal to meet the country's energy needs continues to diminish.",

      "Early year gains reflect a confluence of factors as Trump claims a turnaround.",
      "The U.S. military is tracking strong early-year recruiting figures across the services, a signal it will meet or exceed 2024 performances, military officials told ABC News.",
      "The Army and Navy, the two largest services and the most ailing from recruiting challenges, both say they've recruited at promising rates in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, which began on Oct. 1. However, neither the Army nor the Navy could readily point out a reason, and the Navy said it is too early in the fiscal year to evaluate.",
      "\"We've seen momentum unlike anything we've [had] in a decade,\" said Gen. James Mingus, the Army's vice chief of staff, at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, March 12 -- when he disclosed that five months into its recruiting year the Army had already signed up close to 73% of the year's annual goal of 61,000 recruits.",
      "The upward recruiting trends for the military services began last summer and have continued at a high pace. Some service chiefs projected then that the numbers would quickly surpass this year's annual recruiting goals and build up the pool of recruits needed to start off the new recruiting year in October.",
      "From 2023 to 2024, during the final year of the Biden administration, recruitment across the services jumped 12.5%, according to the Department of Defense.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said increased recruitments after President Donald Trump's election were a reflection of a new mindset the Pentagon would promote to service members -- a \"warrior ethos\" that Hegseth has said would focus away from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives he said were a distraction from a focus on military lethality.",
      "\"I think we've seen enthusiasm and excitement from young men and women who want to join the military actively because they are interested in being a part of the finest fighting force the world has to offer and not doing a lot of other things that serve oftentimes, too often, to divide or distract,\" Hegseth said after becoming secretary.",
      "At his confirmation hearing to be secretary, Hegseth said the military's strongest recruiting asset was the commander in chief himself. \"There is no better recruiter in my mind for our military than President Donald Trump,\" he told senators.",
      "One commanding general of recruitment, Air Force Brig. Gen. Christopher Amrhein, told ABC News that \"there is no one silver bullet\" for recruiting, but he said the Air Force had \"honed in on the right ingredients, and they're all working.\"",
      "Alex Wagner, a former senior Pentagon official in the Biden administration, said Hegseth's conception of recruiting by promoting a warrior ethos amounted to \"little more than a restatement, not even a rebranding, of existing efforts.\"",
      "Hegseth's approach brings \"nothing new of any substance,\" said Wagner, who, as Air Force assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs, was a civilian leader in recruiting.",
      "\"People want to come into the military for a number of reasons, but one of the key reasons is to be something bigger than yourself and to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" he added. \"I think we've long been building a warrior ethos.\"",
      "In his address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month, Trump said the U.S. Army \"had its single best recruiting month in 15 years.\"",
      "That claim may be a reference to the Army's recruiting success this past January. A defense official told ABC News that in January, the Army recorded the highest average growth in contracts per day since January 2010.",
      "Mingus attributed the turnaround to changes in \"who you recruit, where you recruit, how we recruit, more professionalizing of our recruit[ing] force [and] expanding the population.\"",
      "\"All of those things [that] we've been working [on] for the last 18 to 24 months, we believe are coming to fruition,\" he said.",
      "The president took the credit for steady recruiting gains among the services, falsely claiming in the address to Congress that \"it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.\"",
      "Hegseth said in the past women should not serve in combat roles and that \"normal\" white men had been pushed away from serving.",
      "\"I'm straight-up just saying that we should not have women in combat roles -- it hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated,\" Hegseth said on the \"Shawn Ryan Podcast\" in November.",
      "Critics have worried it could have a chilling effect on recruitment for groups including women and non-white men.",
      "\"In recent weeks, for the very first time, I've heard from a number of women, both in the service and who would consider the service, questioning whether or not the military is a place for them,\" Wagner said. \"Clearly this stems from the secretary's firing of the military's two most senior women, who earned their positions -- and the respect of their peers -- based solely on merit.\"",
      "Asked for demographic data on the first quarter 2025 figures, only the Air Force was able to answer ABC News' query. A spokesperson said Air Force officials \"weren't tracking any significant demographic change\" at this point.",
      "A Navy spokesperson said it was \"too early to tell\" about demographics but pointed to successful early-year figures. Comparing the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 to that of fiscal year 2024, the Navy contracted 4,000 new sailors and shipped 5,000 more to boot camp, the spokesperson said.",
      "It set its recruiting goal at its highest in 20 years, a turnaround from the pandemic era, when benchmarks and enlistments slumped.",
      "\"We are on pace to exceed recruiting goals in 2025,\" said Adm. James Kilby, the Navy's vice chief of naval operations, in the congressional hearing on Wednesday, March 12. \"We've made some progress in the Navy, as the other services have. We have stopped the problem.\"",
      "The Navy spokesperson said the service makes assessments on figures on an annual basis but noted that some policies that enlarged the pool of recruits, including a preparatory course that helps potential sailors meet Navy academic and physical standards, have helped the effort.",
      "The Navy's prep course followed the success of the Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course that contributed close to a quarter of last year's Army recruiting goal of 55,000 recruits.",
      "\"We did open up the aperture a little bit for people that want to serve in uniform, and we expanded various policies to increase opportunities for qualified candidates,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Policies that open the aperture enable services to tap into a wider range of potential recruits -- and the prep courses are intended to help them reach the academic or physical shape to meet standards.",
      "Katherine Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, said the Army and Navy prep courses act as a sort of \"pre-basic training\" program.",
      "Only 23% of youth are eligible based on service standards to serve in the military, and 9% of youth are interested in signing up, Kuzminski said, narrowing the pool to a \"Venn diagram [that] does not necessarily overlap.\"",
      "The Air Force has also had a recruiting success story, said an Air Force Accessions Center spokesman, due largely to more recruiters in the field. The Air Force, under which the tiny Space Force is folded, has hiked its recruiting goals by 20% in 2025.",
      "Wagner said the Biden administration had \"initiate[d] a comprehensive review of military [entry] standards to ensure they made sense in the year 2025,\" paving the way for it to meet its 2024 goals and even adjust them higher before the fiscal year ended.",
      "Part of the approach was \"making sure that our requirements were realistic, rather than an outdated vestige of a different era,\" said Wagner, who also served under secretaries of defense in the Obama administration.",
      "The Air Force during the Biden administration loosened body fat standards, which were stricter than the Army and Navy standards, he said, and it lifted a lifetime ban for airmen who tested positive for THC, as other military services had after recreational marijuana was legalized in parts of the United States.",
      "Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, in a March 3 post on X, said recruitment for December, January and February were at 15-year highs and that the delayed entry program, or the DEP, is at its largest in nearly 10 years.",
      "The DEP, which allows services to recruit future service members and ship them to boot camp at a later date, is a product of sustained work, Wagner said.",
      "\"I mean, you don't build the healthiest DEP in a decade over the course of five weeks, right?\" he added.",
      "It's unclear whether early success for military recruiters is a consequence of Biden administration policies such as the prep courses or enthusiasm for the new president -- or a combination of both.",
      "It is too early to assign credit, Kuzminski said.",
      "\"We can't dismiss the fact that perhaps [the current administration] did affect either American youth's decision to join the military or, more likely, their parents' willingness to let them go into the military, for some portion of those folks,\" she said.",
      "\"But the reality is that over the last three years, we've seen a lot of structural changes that improved the recruiting enterprise as a whole,\" she added.",
      "The smallest military service, the U.S. Marine Corps, has been historically resilient to recruiting shocks like the pandemic.",
      "A Marine official said in a statement to ABC News that the Marine Corps \"consistently meets its required accession mission.\" That \"enduring success,\" the official said, \"is directly attributed to the hard work of our Marine Recruiters.\"",

      "Dust storms have proven deadly to motorists across the U.S. for years",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A gust of wind sweeps over bare soil, kicking up enough dirt and dust to cut visibility to nearly zero, and for drivers, the dust storm seems to come out of nowhere.",
      "Such conditions resulted in a pileup on Interstate 70 last week in western Kansas involving dozens of cars and trucks that left eight people dead. Blinding dust also prompted New Mexico's transportation department to close Interstate 25 from the Colorado border southwest to Las Vegas, New Mexico.",
      "Hazy or dust-darkened skies have recalled the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d of the 1930s, when millions of tons of blowing soil buried farms and coated towns across the Great Plains. Lesser storms occur every year, particularly in the western U.S., particularly when farmland hasn't been planted yet in the spring. Some scientists worry that many motorists don't take them seriously enough.",
      "\u201cWe have a very low level of public awareness of a dust storm and what damage it can cause,\u201d said Daniel Tong, an associate professor of atmospheric chemistry at George Mason University who is among the authors of a 2023 paper on dust storm deaths.",
      "The High Plains Museum in Goodland displays a photo of a tractor buried in blown soil in the 1930s, a reminder of the consequences of a severe drought across the Great Plains that came after farming had destroyed native grasses.",
      "The fatalities Friday near Goodland were the first in the area in a dust storm since 2014, said Jeremy Martin, the Weather Service meteorologist in charge there.",
      "But they came less than a month after an 11-car pileup on I-25 left three people dead, with heavy dust cited as a factor, according to Albuquerque TV's KRQE. Similarly, a dust storm on I-55 between St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois, in 2023 led to a fatal pileup involving dozens of vehicles.",
      "In 1991, 17 people died in an accident involving more than 100 vehicles on I-5 in California's San Joaquin Valley, blamed on blowing dust.",
      "Tong and four co-authors concluded in their paper published in 2023 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that there were 232 deaths from \u201cwindblown dust events\u201d from 2007 through 2017, far higher than the number recorded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association data.",
      "In January, he and four colleagues concluded that the economic damaged caused by wind erosion and dust is four times higher than previously calculated and more than $154 billion a year.",
      "Martin said a cold front moved through the area of the pileup after it had been warm and dry for six hours. Winds that reached 70 miles per hour (113 kph) kicked up dust that then became trapped in the cold front.",
      "\u201cThat's when you get that classic wall of dust,\" he said.",
      "As blowing dust cut visibility on the road to almost zero, drivers slowed down, causing collisions, authorities said.",
      "A preliminary investigation found that 71 vehicles were involved, said Kansas Highway Patrol spokesperson April McCollum. Aerial photos showed at least 10 were semis.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to even keep your eyes open outside because there was so much dust in the air,\u201d said Jeremy Martin, the National Weather Service meteorologist in charge in Goodland. \u201cIt kind of stung to even breathe out in it.\u201d",
      "Similar conditions in eastern Colorado prompted the Colorado State Patrol to warn drivers: \u201cZero visibility due to high winds and blowing dirt.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t see,\u201d said Jerry Burkhart, the fire and emergency services chief in Lamar, Colorado. \u201cThe best thing to do is get way off the road in a parking lot or something like that.\u201d",
      "Martin said it's hard to tell how thick dust is from a distance, so motorists often don't know they won't able to see until they're in it.",
      "Weather Service forecasters also said some of the advice for motorists in a dust storm is counter-intuitive. Michael Anand, a NWS meteorologist in Albuquerque, said motorists should pull off the road as safely as possible, turn off all lights and never use their high beams.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want people behind you to think you\u2019re going in the road,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat light from your tail light might be the only thing they can see. They\u2019re thinking the road suddenly curves.\u201d",
      "High winds make cars harder to control, and a dust storm coats the road with fine particles that slow breaking, and drivers panic, Tong said.",
      "He said dust storms are frequent and widespread enough across the U.S. that states should test prospective drivers on what to do in a dust storm on license exams.",
      "\u201cThat could be, actually, a very easy way to educate drivers,\u201d he said.",

      "The report attributed the heating to human activity \u2014 like the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 and in a smaller part to the naturally occurring El Nino weather phenomenon. An El Nino formed in June 2023 and dissipated a year later, adding extra heat and helping topple temperature records. In 2024, the world surpassed the 1.5 C limit for the first time \u2014 but just for a single year. Scientists measure breaching the climate goal as Earth staying above that level of warming over a longer time period.",
      "The report said global heating is contributing to more extreme weather events that have led the highest levels of displacement for 16 years, contributed to worsening food crises and caused massive economic losses. There were at least 151 \u201cunprecedented\u201d extreme weather events in 2024 alone, it said.",
      "\u201cIt is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies and to the planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo, WMO's Secretary-General.",

      "A Columbia University student activist who was detained by the U.S. government over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations has the right to challenge the legality of his detention",
      "NEW YORK -- A Columbia University student activist who was detained by the U.S. government over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations has the right to challenge the legality of his detention, but the case should be heard in New Jersey, rather than in New York or Louisiana, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident with no criminal record, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8. From there, he was taken to an immigration detention center in New Jersey, where he spent the night. Then he was taken back to New York, put on a plane and flown to an immigration facility in Jenna, Louisiana.",
      "\u201cThese are serious allegations and arguments that, no doubt, warrant careful review by a court of law; the fundamental constitutional principle that all persons in the United States are entitled to due process of law demands no less,\u201d wrote U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.",
      "This review should happen in federal court in New Jersey, rather than in the New York court where his legal team initially brought the case, or in Louisiana, where Khalil is now detained, because New Jersey is state where Khalid was being held at the time his lawyers first went to court, Furman wrote.",
      "The federal government said it had to move Khalid to Louisiana because of a lack of available detention center beds in the metropolitan New York region. It also cited a bedbug infestation at the closer lockup in Elizabeth, New Jersey.",
      "Attorneys for Khalil have disputed these justifications in a series of court filings since his arrest. They describe the transfer as a \u201cretaliatory\u201d action meant to deprive their client of access to counsel while ensuring the case is held in a jurisdiction that may be more favorable to the Republican administration\u2019s unusual legal claim.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited as grounds for Khalil\u2019s deportation a rarely-used statute giving him sweeping power to deport those who pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "While the White House has accused Khalil of \u201csiding with terrorists,\u201d they have yet to give any evidence for the claim. Still, President Trump has described Khalil\u2019s case as the \u201cfirst of many to come.\u201d",
      "Khalil, a 30-year-old international affairs graduate student, had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student activists at Columbia University who took over a campus lawn last spring in protest of the war in Gaza.",
      "Images of his maskless face at protests, along with his willingness to share his name with reporters, had made him a target among people who saw antisemitism in the demonstrations. In the weeks leading up to his arrest, Khalil repeatedly appealed to Columbia University\u2019s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, for protection, citing threats from right-wing doxing groups.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal program designed to prevent targeted violence and terrorism in the United States has lost 20% of its staff after layoffs hit its probationary staffers.",
      "The Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships was a redefined version of programs created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a way to identify people who could pose new terrorism threats or carry out violence and prevent tragedies by getting them help. It has a mission enlisting parents, coaches, teachers and ministers to head off trouble before it starts by training them to look for signs of trouble in advance.",
      "That job became far more difficult after eight members of the center's staff were fired in early March as part of the Trump administration's efforts to trim the government by getting rid of probationary staffers. According to a Department of Homeland Security employee and a center employee who was fired, the staffers were rehired late Monday but were then put on administrative leave, following two March 13 court decisions ordering the Republican administration to rehire fired probationary staffers.",
      "The administration vowed to fight the decisions. The staffers spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concerns they might be targeted for retribution.",
      "The center's director confirmed the terminations in a statement to The Associated Press. William Braniff said that with his appointment to the director's job ending soon, he decided the best thing he could do for the staffers and for the center was to \u201cresign alongside of them, as some agencies and departments have rehired people in mission critical offices once they were made aware of the implications of those terminations.\u201d",
      "Braniff said there is a huge demand for the assistance provided by the center, called CP3 for short.",
      "\u201cCP3 is the inheritor of the primary and founding mission of DHS \u2014 to prevent terrorism,\u201d he said, adding that the center's approach \"is as effective for preventing school shootings as it is for terrorism prevention.\u201d",
      "In a post on LinkedIn before he resigned, Braniff said grant applications last year increased 82% and 27 states were lined up to work with the center to create plans to address targeted violence and prevent terrorism; 16 states already had plans in place or were creating them.",
      "The employees terminated included former social workers, mental health professionals and state public health officials. Before the layoffs there had been more than 40 staff members at the center, with most based in Washington, D.C.",
      "In a statement, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said President Donald Trump is leading an effort to make \u201csweeping cuts and reforms\u201d across the federal government to get rid of \u201c egregious waste and incompetence.\u201d",
      "She said leaders at the department \u201cidentified non-mission-critical personnel in probationary status\u201d and added: \u201cDHS remains focused on supporting law enforcement and public safety through funding,\u202ftraining, increased public awareness, and partnerships.\u201d",
      "Tom Warrick, a former counterterrorism official at Homeland Security who's now at the Atlantic Council, said the center, launched in 2021 under the Biden administration, was intended to develop projects that try to identify people before they turn violent, regardless of ideology or motivation, and steer them toward help through community health programs.",
      "Warrick said that the center has been doing \u201cpioneering\u201d work and that the payoff is \u201cenormous\u201d in terms of shootings and attacks averted.",
      "\u201cWhat they really need to do is to expand it, not cut it back,\u201d he said.",
      "The grants provide funding to state, local, tribal and territorial governments, nonprofits and education institutions to help them establish or grow their own programs to address targeted violence and terrorism.",
      "The center replaced the Trump-era Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention, which itself replaced an Obama-era program called Countering Violent Extremism. Earlier iterations of the program were criticized for unfairly targeting Muslim and minority communities, and critics said it was difficult to measure results.",
      "Some of those concerns still remain, said Spencer Reynolds, senior counsel to the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. He said the Brennan Center has long had concerns about the program's civil liberties protections. Even with the emphasis on bringing in public health providers, he said, there's still too much of an emphasis on law enforcement.",
      "Last year, the center announced $18 million in grant funding to 35 recipients.",
      "Those grants included $700,000 to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Florida as it worked to \u201cincrease community awareness of the signs that someone may be on a pathway to violence.\u201d Another $344,982 went to the Southwest Texas Fusion Center to help it expand its behavioral threat assessment and management team to cover more counties in southwest Texas, where it works to help schools reduce violence.",

      "Top Democrats on the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees have filed a lengthy Freedom of Information Act request about the Department of Government Efficiency",
      "WASHINGTON -- Top Democrats on the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees have filed a lengthy Freedom of Information Act request questioning whether the Trump administration\u2019s DOGE Service is operating \u201coutside the bounds of federal law,\u201d The Associated Press has learned.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia are seeking detailed information about the authority of the Department of Government Efficiency Service, including billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and some 40 other people, to carry out firings of federal workers and dismantling of federal agencies.",
      "They also are requesting detailed information about DOGE's access to sensitive data, its use of artificial intelligence, the resumes and training of its staff and its communications related to Musk-held entities including SpaceX, Starlink and Tesla.",
      "\u201cThe Administration and Mr. Musk have hidden behind a veil of secrecy as they systematically dismantle the federal government of the United States,\" the Democrats wrote in a letter to DOGE administrator Amy Gleason accompanying the FOIA request, which was obtained by the AP. \"The American people deserve answers, and we are committed to using every tool at our disposal to expose the truth about DOGE\u2019s operations.\"",
      "They are seeking expedited review of the request, with a response within 20 days.",
      "The FOIA request is the latest in an escalating confrontation between Congress and the executive branch as President Donald Trump is rapidly slashing routine aspects of the federal government by doing away with thousands of workers and unwinding various longstanding agencies and services.",
      "The Oversight Committee Democrats have already issued a formal request for information from the Republican president's administration on Musk's potential conflicts of interest, which is pending. Their attempt to subpoena Musk was rejected by committee Republicans, who hold the majority in Congress.",
      "While generally anyone can file a FOIA request, the Democrats on the panels are utilizing the avenues at their disposal as the minority party to press for oversight of the Republican administration any way they can. It's also a potential step toward more binding measures, including legal action.",
      "In the FOIA request, Raskin and Connolly, who are the ranking Democrats on the committees, wrote that the information is necessary \u201cto provide answers to the many open questions and an explanation to the public.\"",
      "They said, \u201cThere exist possible questions concerning the government\u2019s integrity regarding DOGE\u2019s operations, formation, and activity, which form the basis of this request, as many of DOGE\u2019s actions may be outside the bounds of federal law.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the Trump administration will respond.",
      "Trump and Musk have shown little regard for the protests coming from Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 in Congress as their teams march across the federal government. Musk has vowed transparency, but the Democrats noted he has met privately with House and Senate Republicans.",
      "The Trump administration is purging employees, shuttering federal agencies and otherwise disrupting operations in the name of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse. Some 100 lawsuits have been filed, with judges slowing and stopping some actions, while allowing others.",
      "In the sweeping request, the Democrats seek four main types of information about the authority involved with DOGE\u2019s activity: its access to sensitive data; the guidance and decision-making around its firings of federal employees; the potential conflicts of interest around its leadership; and its internal communications.",
      "They seek the names, job titles and qualifications of DOGE staffers who have \u201cbeen granted access to personally identifiable or sensitive information\" since inauguration day, Jan. 20, and their purpose for doing so.",
      "Additionally, they want to know about the various computer programs, including but \u201cnot limited to, artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), your agency is using to store, process or analyze personally identifiable or sensitive information or data.\"",
      "The request seeks all DOGE directives, guidance and analyses around the firing of federal workers, including the dismissal of inspectors general, and the undoing of various government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Education and others.",
      "Democrats are also requesting information about DOGE's authority to direct and execute these directives as well as details around the funding of DOGE operations.",
      "Musk, DOGE administrator Gleason and some 40 other employees are listed in the FOIA request, which seeks information about their resumes, salaries, any conflict of interest waivers and any non-disclosure agreements involving their employment.",
      "The request also seeks all communication from those workers, including via text message, and various messaging platforms, and specifically around key words including Musk-related entities SpaceX, Starlink, Twitter, Tesla and others.",

      "\u201cHearing that awful sound of your car bottoming out \u2014 it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said.",
      "Oregon transportation officials say that without more funding, residents like Taylor could see further declines in the quality of roads, highways and bridges starting this year. But revenues from gas taxes paid by drivers at the pump are projected to decrease as more people adopt electric and fuel-efficient cars, forcing officials to look for new ways to fund transportation infrastructure.",
      "States with aggressive climate goals like Oregon face a conundrum: EVs can help reduce emissions in the transportation sector, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they also mean less gas tax revenue in government coffers.",
      "\u201cWe now find ourselves right now in a position where we want to address fuel use and drive down reliance on gases and internal combustion engines. But we need the funds to operate our roads that EVs need to use as well,\u201d said Carra Sahler, director of the Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.",
      "Motor fuel taxes are the largest source of transportation revenue for states, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers\u2019 most recent report on state expenditures.

      "In California, where zero-emission vehicles accounted for about a quarter of car sales last year, legislative analysts predict gas tax collections will decrease by $5 billion \u2014 or 64% \u2014 by 2035, in a scenario where the state successfully meets its climate goals. California and Oregon are among the multiple states that will require all new passenger cars sold to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.",

      "The Oregon Department of Transportation \u2014 citing inflation, projections of declining gas tax revenues and certain spending limitations \u2014 has estimated a shortfall topping $350 million for the next budget cycle.",
      "That could mean cuts to winter snow plowing and the striping and paving of roads, as well as layoffs of as many as 1,000 transportation employees.",
      "Republican lawmakers say the gas tax revenue issue has been compounded by the department mismanaging its money. An audit released in January found the department overestimated its revenue for the current budget cycle by over $1 billion and failed to properly track certain funds.",
      "\u201cIt really is about making sure that the existing dollars that are being spent by the department are being spent efficiently and effectively,\u201d said state Sen. Bruce Starr, GOP co-vice chair of the joint transportation committee.",
      "To make up for lost revenue, 34 states have raised their gas tax since 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California has the highest gas tax at over 69 cents a gallon when including other taxes and fees, while Alaska has the lowest at 9 cents a gallon, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In Oregon \u2014 which in 1919 became the first state to implement a gas tax \u2014 it is 40 cents a gallon.",
      "The federal gas tax of 18 cents a gallon, which isn\u2019t adjusted for inflation, hasn\u2019t been raised in over three decades.",
      "In Oregon, where there is no sales tax and tolling has met fierce opposition, lawmakers are debating next steps.",
      "Oregon is among the states that have already raised registration fees for EVs.",
      "Other states have taken such steps as indexing their gas tax to inflation, raising registration fees for EVs and taxing EV charging stations.",
      "To bolster transportation dollars, some have reorganized their budgets. In Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was first elected using the slogan \u201cFix the Damn Roads,\u201d some revenues from marijuana taxes and personal income taxes now go toward transportation. In Connecticut, the sales tax now brings in more money for its special transportation fund than gas tax revenues, a 2024 fiscal report shows.",

      "All five judges in the state criminal appeals court ruled that attorneys for former Decatur police officer Mac Marquette failed to present \u201cany sworn affidavit or factual evidence\u201d that proved Alabama circuit court judge Charles Elliot had compromised his integrity in the case. Marquette\u2019s lawyers filed an appeal with the state criminal appeals court after Elliot denied their motion that he recuse himself.",
      "Marquette is charged with murder for fatally shooting Steve Perkins in 2023 while accompanying a tow-truck driver to repossess Perkins' truck. Marquette's lawyers said Perkins pointed a gun at the tow-truck driver, and that the officer should be granted immunity under \u201cstand your ground\" laws, which remove the duty to retreat before using deadly force in the face of danger.",
      "A neighbor's home surveillance video, broadcast by WAFF, appears to show Marquette firing his weapon almost 20 times. The shooting sparked intense public outcry and protests across Decatur, a city of approximately 60,000 people in northern Alabama. Protesters and civil rights attorneys say Marquette didn't give Perkins time to follow his orders.",
      "In a petition to the state court of criminal appeals, Marquette's attorneys accused Elliot of engaging in improper communication outside of official court proceedings on multiple occasions, and called for a hearing to present evidence on those allegations. In at least one instance, Marquette's lawyers accused Elliot of telling Decatur Police Department Lt. Mike Burleson that he had already decided to deny Marquette immunity because of the high-profile nature of the case, and out of fear for the safety of his family and potential backlash in his 2026 reelection campaign.",
      "The petition cited an unidentified witness who told Marquette that they overheard the conversation.",
      "In a written affidavit, Elliot said defense lawyers filed the motion for his recusal \u201crecklessly and with disregard for the truth.\u201d He said he had a longtime friendship with Burleson but vehemently denied that the conversation took place.",
      "The recusal petition also said Elliot attempted to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d one defense attorney in a call made on a holiday outside of official court proceedings. The appeals court ruled that it was not improper for Elliot to call the defense attorney because the call was procedural.",

      "Five months after their arrival in Sissonville, the couple was arrested after neighbors saw Lantz lock the oldest girl and her teenage brother in a shed and leave the property. A deputy used a crowbar to get them out.",
      "Inside the main residence, a 9-year-old girl was found crying in a loft alone with no protection from falling, according to a criminal complaint. The children were found in dirty clothes and smelling of body odor, deputies said, and the oldest boy was found barefoot with what appeared to be sores on his feet.",
      "A fourth child was with Lantz when he eventually returned, and deputies were later led to a 5-year-old girl. All five were turned over to Child Protective Services after the couple's arrest.",
      "Last month the oldest daughter, now an adult, sued the couple, alleging severe physical and emotional abuse and neglect that has scarred her permanently.",
      "During trial, neighbors testified they never saw the children play and witnessed Lantz make them stand in line or perform difficult chores around the yard, including lifting heavy items. After Lantz noticed the curious neighbors, the children mostly stayed indoors.",
      "The eldest daughter testified the outdoor work occurred mostly in Washington and that some of them were forced to use their hands for digging. She also said the children were cursed at \u201call the time\u201d and that Whitefeather used racist language.",
      "The daughter said Whitefeather gave preferential treatment to the youngest child, who wasn't involved in any of the charges, and that Whitefeather had told the other children that she wished for a life without them.",
      "The daughter also said the children were fed a steady diet of peanut butter sandwiches at scheduled times, some left over from a previous meal. Some kids were forced to stand in their rooms for hours and keep their hands on their heads. The oldest girl and boy shared a room, were forced to sleep on the floor and used the same bucket for the bathroom while the other held up a sheet for privacy from the home's security cameras, according to testimony.",
      "The couple and their attorneys pushed back on the accusations, with Lantz testifying that the chores were assigned to teach the children responsibility.",
      "The defense argued the couple was simply overwhelmed with trying to get help for the children\u2019s mental health issues, abuse and trauma from their biological home. Lantz\u2019s attorney, John Balenovich, said the state\u2019s child welfare agency, which the family requested help from several times, \u201cdropped the ball the most in this case.\u201d",
      "A forensic psychologist for the prosecution testified that the couple\u2019s treatment of the children had worsened their conditions.",
      "Assistant Prosecutor Madison Tuck said the couple never sought help for the oldest boy despite a behavioral health clinic being just minutes from their home. The boy, whose physical altercation with Whitefeather in 2022 was cited by attorneys as the start of the family\u2019s internal struggles, currently is receiving full-time care in a psychiatric facility.",
      "Whitefeather\u2019s attorney, Mark Plants, said during closing argument that the couple was only guilty of making poor parenting decisions.",
      "\u201cThese are farm people that do farm chores,\u201d Plants said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about race. It wasn\u2019t about forced labor.\u201d",

      "Immigration advocates say a woman who gained prominence after she took refuge in Denver churches to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration has been detained",
      "DENVER -- A woman who gained prominence after she took refuge in churches in Colorado to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration has been detained, immigration advocates said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether Jeanette Vizguerra had been taken into custody.",
      "Vizguerra, a mother of four, was arrested Monday at a Denver-area Target store where she worked, said Jordan Garcia of the American Friends Service Committee, who has been in contact with Vizguerra's lawyer and family.",
      "Vizguerra has been trying to gain a visa given to crime victims that allows them to remain in the United States since she left sanctuary in churches in 2020, Garcia said.",
      "Denver Mayor Mike Johnston blasted the Trump administration for the reported arrest of Vizguerra, an immigration and labor activist. Johnston, who defended Denver's sanctuary city policies in Congress earlier this month, called on people to demand that ICE release Vizguerra and give her due process rights.",
      "\u201cThis is not immigration enforcement intended to keep our country safe. This is Putin-style persecution of political dissidents,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "News of Vizguerra's detention prompted a protest outside an ICE detention center in the Denver suburb of Aurora, where her family said she is being held. Buses left the facility in the morning, raising fears that she would be deported, but her family said Vizguerra was still there later in the day.",
      "\u201cWe hope ICE will work with her attorney to release her immediately,\" the family said in a statement included in an update from the American Friends Service Committee.",
      "Vizguerra's lawyers said ICE is attempting to remove her based on an order that was never valid. Petitions challenging her detention have been filed in both Denver's federal court and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "\u201cIf ICE proceeds with trying to remove her without legal authority, it sends a chilling message about the agency\u2019s disregard for due process and the rule of law,\u201d one of the attorneys, Laura Lichter, said in a statement.",
      "Vizguerra, who came to Colorado in 1997 from Mexico City, has been fighting deportation since 2009 after she was pulled over in suburban Denver and found to have a fraudulent Social Security card with her own name and birth date but someone else's actual number, according to a 2019 lawsuit she brought against ICE. Vizguerra did not know the number belonged to someone else at the time, it said.",
      "The lawsuit, which she later dropped, alleged that ICE did not have a valid order to deport her after she pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count in that case because it says she voided it by agreeing to self-deport to Mexico. ICE wrongly tried to revive that order after Vizguerra was arrested for reentering the United States later, the lawsuit said.",
      "She began living in churches in 2017 to avoid being deported under the first Trump administration after a hold on her deportation was not renewed. She was given a two-year stay of deportation after two members of Colorado's congressional delegation, Sen. Michael Bennet and then-Rep. Jared Polis, who is now Colorado's governor, introduced what are known as private bills to give her a path to become a permanent resident. Such delays have sometimes been extended for years as lawmakers reintroduce the measures aimed at helping individual immigrants, but few of the measures ever become law.",
      "After that stay was not renewed in 2019, Vizguerra again entered church sanctuary but then left in 2020, according to a timeline provided by the American Friends Service Committee.",

      "The Republican-backed candidate in Wisconsin\u2019s closely watched state Supreme Court race has resurfaced long debunked concerns about voting fraud because of the late reporting of ballots in Milwaukee",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Republican-backed candidate in Wisconsin's closely watched state Supreme Court race has resurfaced long debunked concerns about voting fraud because of the late reporting of ballots in Milwaukee just two weeks before the April 1 election.",
      "Brad Schimel, a former Republican attorney general, spoke of the possibility of \u201cbags of ballots\u201d and fraud in Milwaukee during an interview Tuesday on conservative talk radio. Schimel faces Democratic-backed Susan Crawford in the April 1 election with majority control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court at stake.",
      "Schimel, in an interview on WISN-AM, said his supporters need to \u201cget our votes banked, make this too big to rig so we don\u2019t have to worry that at 11:30 in Milwaukee, they\u2019re going to find bags of ballots that they forgot to put into the machines.\u201d",
      "Schimel said that happened in 2018 and in November \u201cwhen (U.S. Senate candidate) Eric Hovde was ahead all night, and then all of a sudden, Milwaukee County changed that.\u201d",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike, along with state and Milwaukee election leaders, warned in the run-up to the November election that Milwaukee absentee ballots would be reported late and cause a huge influx of Democratic votes. Milwaukee is the state's most populated city and is heavily Democratic.",
      "The reporting of those absentee ballots swung the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, fueling baseless conspiracy theories that the election had been stolen from President Donald Trump.",
      "Milwaukee's absentee ballots are counted at a central location and reported all at once, often well after midnight on election day. Elections officials for years have made clear that those ballots are reported later than usual due to the sheer number that have to be counted and because state law does not allow them to be processed until polls open.",
      "In 2018, the reporting of more than 47,000 absentee ballots after midnight put Democrat Tony Evers ahead of then-Gov. Scott Walker. Evers went on to win and Walker criticized the late reporting, saying it blindsided him.",
      "And in November, Hovde said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the reporting of more than 108,000 ballots in Milwaukee early in the morning after the election in his defeat to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.",
      "Schimel said in the radio interview he didn't know what happened.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if there was fraud there,\u201d Schimel said. \"There\u2019s no way for me to know that. All I know is this: We need to turn our votes out. That\u2019s the best insulation we have against any potential fraud, is just get our people to the polls.\u201d",
      "Asked about his concerns during an appearance later Tuesday at the Milwaukee Rotary Club, Schimel said he brought up fraud because voters often ask him how to guarantee election integrity.",
      "\u201cI tell people, by following the rules,\u201d Schimel said. \u201cAnd then I tell them, \u2018Here\u2019s the best way to make sure your vote isn\u2019t stolen: Go use it.\u2019 That\u2019s the answer.\u201d",
      "Yet despite his concerns, Schimel said: \u201cI will always accept the results of the election.\u201d",
      "Crawford's spokesperson, Derrick Honeyman, said Schimel was \"dabbling in conspiracy theories to please his ally, Elon Musk, and it\u2019s unbecoming of a judge and candidate for the state\u2019s high court.\u201d",
      "Groups funded by billionaire Musk have contributed more than $11 million to help Schimel's campaign. Crawford is backed by several billionaire Democrats, including philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "The election comes as the court faces cases on abortion, public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries. Who controls the court also could factor into how it might rule on any future voting challenge in the perennial presidential battleground state \u2014 raising the stakes for national Republicans and Democrats.",

      "The government says he could not be detained at an immigration facility near where he was originally arrested in part because of a bedbug infestation, so they sent him to Louisiana. The student, Mahmoud Khalil, says there was no such discussion of bedbugs and he feared he was being immediately deported.",
      "Khalil said in a declaration filed in Manhattan federal court Monday that while he was held overnight at a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, \"I did not hear anyone mention bedbugs.\u201d",
      "In court papers over the weekend, lawyers for the Justice Department also blamed his move on overcrowded facilities in the Northeast.",
      "Khalil made the statement about bedbugs in an exhibit attached to court papers in which his lawyers asked that he be freed on bail while the courts decide whether his arrest violated the First Amendment.",
      "The lawyers have also asked a judge to widen the effect of any order to stop the U.S. government from \u201carresting, detaining, and removing noncitizens who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\u201d",
      "In his declaration, Khalil said he was put in a van when he was taken away from the Elizabeth facility and he asked if he was being returned to FBI headquarters in Manhattan, where he was taken immediately after his arrest.",
      "\u201cI was told, \u2018no, we are going to JFK Airport.\u2019 I was afraid they were trying to deport me,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Of his time spent at the Elizabeth facility, he wrote: \u201cI was in a waiting room with about ten other people. We slept on the ground. Even though it was cold inside the room, there were no beds, mattresses, or blankets.\u201d",
      "In the weekend court papers, lawyers for the Justice Department gave a detailed description of Khalil's March 8 arrest and his transport from Manhattan to Elizabeth and then to Kennedy International Airport in New York the next day for his transfer to Louisiana, where he has been held since.",
      "\u201cKhalil could not be housed at Elizabeth Detention Facility long-term due to a bedbug issue, so he remained there until his flight to Louisiana,\u201d the lawyers wrote. They said he was at the facility from 2:20 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. on March 9.",
      "The lawyers have asked that legal issues be addressed by federal judges in New Jersey or Louisiana rather than New York. A Manhattan federal judge has not yet ruled on the request.",
      "Khalil's lawyers, who oppose transferring the case, wrote in a submission Monday that the transfer to Louisiana was \u201cpredetermined and carried out for improper motives\u201d rather than because of a bedbug infestation.",
      "Despite the bedbug claim, the Elizabeth Detention accepted at least four individuals for detention from March 6 through last Thursday and Khalil himself saw men being processed for detention while he was there, they wrote.",

    "story": [
      "With salmon fishing barred off the California coast for two years, fishermen have been running historic boat tours, party cruises, and scattering the ashes of the deceased to try to stay afloat",
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \u201cCapt. Smitty,\u201d now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\u201cThe bills keep going, whether I\u2019ve got a fishery or not,\u201d said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \u201cThere\u2019s no season on when people die.\u201d",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \u201cpeople over fish\u201d and route more water to farmers in California\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\u201cWe are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\u201d said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O\u2019Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren\u2019t coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\u201cOne is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\u201d said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \u201cIt makes the cash register ring.\u201d",

      "A lawsuit against New York alleging sexual abuse decades ago was tossed out by the state\u2019s top court",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A lawsuit against New York alleging sexual abuse decades ago was tossed out by the state\u2019s top court Tuesday because it lacked specific information, drawing criticism from advocates concerned about setting unrealistically high standards for survivors to recall traumatic events.",
      "The state Court of Appeals reversed a lower appeals court and granted the state's motion to dismiss the claim from a man who says he was repeatedly sexually assaulted around a state-run theater in Albany from 1986 to 1990, starting when he was 12. The suit was filed under the Child Victims Act, a 2019 state law that temporarily allowed people to sue over sexual abuse they suffered long ago as children.",
      "The judges unanimously sided with the state attorney general's office, which argued the lawsuit did not meet legal standards for bringing a claim against the state. The court said allegations in the lawsuit were too vague to allow the state to investigate the extent of its liability.",
      "\u201cThe claim lacks critical information about the abusers. It alleges that the perpetrators included teachers, coaches, counselors, and perhaps other employees of the State, but it does not explain whether those employees were ... teachers, coaches, and counselors, or why, as a child, he was in their company multiple times between 1986 and 1990,\u201d according to the decision by Judge Caitlin Halligan.",
      "The case deals only with requirements for suing New York, not private institutions such as churches or youth groups.",
      "The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly and provide consent.",
      "The case is among roughly 300 filed against the state during a two-year window under the Child Victims Act. Most of the more than 10,800 CVA lawsuits named private institutions.",
      "Jessica Schidlow, legal director of the advocacy group CHILD USA, said the court's decision imposes unrealistic expectations on victims who sued the state under the CVA.",
      "\u201cThis interpretation neglects the modern scientific consensus on the neurobiological impact of trauma which can severely disrupt memory, and it perpetuates decades of procedural hurdles that shut victims out of court,\u201d Schidlow wrote in an email.",
      "The lawsuit was initially dismissed by a state Court of Claims judge who cited the lack of specific dates. A mid-level appeals court reversed that decision in 2023.",

      "President Donald Trump is escalating his attacks on the federal judiciary by calling for the impeachment of a judge who has tried to block his deportations",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Tuesday that a federal judge who tried to stop his deportation plans should be impeached, escalating his conflict with a judiciary that's been one of the few restraints on his administration's aggressive plans.",
      "Trump has routinely criticized judges, especially as they limit his efforts to expand presidential power and impose his sweeping agenda on the federal government. But his call for impeachment \u2014 a rare step that is usually taken only in cases of grave ethical or criminal misconduct \u2014 represents an intensifying clash between the judicial and executive branches.",
      "The Republican president described U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, as an unelected \u201ctroublemaker and agitator\u201d in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform. Boasberg recently issued an order blocking deportation flights under wartime authorities from an 18th century law that Trump invoked to carry out his plans.",
      "\u201cHE DIDN\u2019T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY,\u201d Trump wrote on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges\u2019 I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has been used only three times before in U.S. history, all during congressionally declared wars. Trump issued a proclamation that the law was newly in effect due to what he claimed was an invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. His administration is paying El Salvador to imprison alleged members of the gang.",
      "Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, convened a hearing on Monday to discuss what he called \u201cpossible defiance\u201d of his order after two deportation flights continued to El Salvador despite his verbal order that they be turned around to the U.S.",
      "Trump administration lawyers defended their actions, saying Boasberg's written order wasn't explicit, while an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said \u201cI think we're getting very close\u201d to a constitutional crisis.",
      "The Constitution gives the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority, the power to impeach a judge with a simple majority vote. But, like a presidential impeachment, any removal requires a vote from a two-thirds majority from the Senate.",
      "The president\u2019s latest social media post aligns him more with allies like Elon Musk, who has made similar demands.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing is an attempt by one branch of government to intimidate another branch from performing its constitutional duty. It is a direct threat to judicial independence,\u201d Marin Levy, a Duke University law professor who specializes in the federal courts, said in an email.",
      "Only one day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cI have not heard the president talk about impeaching judges.\u201d",
      "Just 15 judges have been impeached in the nation\u2019s history, according to the U.S. courts governing body, and just eight have been removed.",
      "The last judicial impeachment was in 2010. G. Thomas Porteous Jr. of New Orleans was impeached on charges he accepted bribes and then lied about it. He was convicted by the Senate and removed from office in December 2010.",
      "Calls to impeach judges have been rising as Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda faces pushback in the courts, and at least two members of Congress have said online they plan to introduce articles of impeachment against Boasberg. House Republicans already have filed articles of impeachment against two other judges, Amir Ali and Paul Engelmayer, over rulings they\u2019ve made in Trump-related lawsuits.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Delaware is trying to protect its status as the corporate capital of the world amid fallout from a judge's rejection of billionaire Elon Musk \u2019s landmark Tesla compensation package, although critics say fast-tracked legislation will tilt the playing field against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers.",
      "A Delaware House committee was expected to vote Wednesday on the bill, which is backed by Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer who says it'll ensure the state remains the \"premier home for U.S. and global businesses\u201d to incorporate.",
      "Backers say it'll modernize the law and maintain balance between corporate officers and shareholders in a state where the courts, for a century, have settled all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "Critics \u2014 including institutional investors, pension funds and asset managers \u2014 say it\u2019ll lower corporate governance standards, curb shareholder rights and, as a result, limit the ability to hold corporate officers accountable for decisions that violate their fiduciary duty.",
      "The bill passed the state Senate unanimously last week.",
      "A Delaware judge last year invalidated Musk's compensation package from Tesla that was potentially worth more than $55 billion. Lawyers for shareholders had sued over the package that Tesla\u2019s board of directors awarded Musk in 2018.",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick said it was developed by directors who weren\u2019t independent of Musk and approved by shareholders who had been given misleading and incomplete disclosures in a proxy statement.",
      "The ruling bumped Musk out of the top spot on Forbes' list of wealthiest people, although he has since climbed back up.",
      "Musk and Tesla are appealing in the state Supreme Court. But Musk unloaded on Delaware, saying \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware\u201d and instead recommended competitors Nevada or Texas as destinations.",
      "Now, lawmakers are being warned by corporate lawyers that their clients are considering heading to the exits \u2014 making a \u201cDexit,\u201d as it's been dubbed \u2014 and that startups are being advised to incorporate elsewhere.",
      "Must took his own advice, moving Tesla\u2019s corporate listing to Texas after a shareholder vote and his companies SpaceX to Texas and Neuralink to Nevada.",
      "Backers of the bill say corporate unrest had been simmering the past couple years over various Delaware Supreme Court decisions in corporate conflict-of-interest cases and that Musk inflamed the discontent.",
      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta didn't confirm the report.",
      "DropBox, the online file-sharing platform, moved its corporate listing to Nevada, and Bill Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, a major hedge fund, said he\u2019d leave Delaware, too.",
      "On Feb. 1, Musk took to his social media platform X to crow about it, saying, \u201cCompanies are flooding out of Delaware, because the activist chief judge of the Delaware court has no respect for shareholder rights.\u201d",
      "That said, critics of the bill say there's no evidence that corporations are fleeing Delaware in any numbers.",
      "It changes several things.",
      "One, it gives corporations more protections in conflict-of-interest cases \u2014 such as a pay package for a CEO or intercompany agreements \u2014 in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",
      "Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, has compiled a running list of three dozen Delaware Supreme Court precedents that the legislation stands to change.",
      "Lawrence Hamermesh, a former professor at Widener University\u2019s Delaware Law School, disagreed. Hamermesh, who helped draft the legislation after Meyer asked him last month, said perhaps only a couple doctrines would be wiped out.",
      "A legal challenge is widely expected should Meyer get the bill and sign it into law. Meanwhile, institutional investors say such a law may prompt them to push corporations that they own to incorporate elsewhere.",
      "Money.",
      "Approximately one-third of Delaware\u2019s state government revenue \u2014 about $2.2 billion \u2014 comes from corporate license fees and associated tax revenues, according to the governor's office. That helps the state to maintain a 0% sales tax and keep property taxes relatively low, a nice perk for the beach vacation home industry along its Atlantic coast.",
      "Beyond that, Wilmington is home to a cottage industry that caters to the corporate lawyers who live, stay, dine and shop around the state Supreme Court and the Chancery Court of Delaware buildings where they argue their cases.",

      "Mehdiyev, testifying in a monotone, said he was paid $30,000 of the $160,000 he expected to be paid for killing Alinejad. To prepare for the job, he took photographs and video footage outside her Brooklyn residence, where he did surveillance for hours a day sometimes.",

      "It was a theme delivered to the jury by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Gutwillig at the trial's start.",
      "He said Alinejad became a target of Iran after encouraging women in Iran to share messages and videos of women protesting the regime by refusing to wear head coverings, or hijabs, in public in Iran, subjecting them to arrest or beatings by the country\u2019s morality police.",
      "\u201cShe shared them with millions. She shined a light on the government of Iran\u2019s oppression of women, and that enraged the regime,\u201d Gutwillig said.",

      "Witness Gina Swanson, a reporter with WDSU, described the execution from her viewpoint as \u201cclinical\u201d and \u201cprocedural.\u201d She said there was nothing that occurred during the process that made her think, \u201cWas that right? Was that how it was supposed to go?\u201d",
      "Hoffman declined to make a final statement in the execution chamber. He also declined a final meal.",
      "It was the fifth time nitrogen gas was used in the U.S. after four executions by the same method \u2014 all in Alabama. Three other executions, by lethal injection, are scheduled this week \u2014 in Arizona on Wednesday and in Florida and Oklahoma on Thursday.",
      "Hoffman was convicted of the murder of Mary \u201cMolly\u201d Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive who was killed in New Orleans. At the time of the crime, Hoffman was 18 and has since spent much of his adult life at the penitentiary in rural southeast Louisiana, where he was executed Tuesday evening.",
      "After court battles earlier this month, attorneys for Hoffman had turned to the Supreme Court in last-ditch hopes of halting the execution. Last year, the court declined to intervene in the nation\u2019s first nitrogen hypoxia execution, in Alabama.",
      "Hoffman\u2019s lawyers had unsuccessfully argued that the nitrogen gas procedure \u2014 which deprives a person of oxygen \u2014 violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The man\u2019s lawyers, in a last-ditch appeal, also argued the method would infringe on Hoffman\u2019s freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to death.",
      "Louisiana officials maintained the method is painless. They also said it was past time for the state to deliver justice as promised to victims\u2019 families after a decade and a half hiatus \u2014 one brought on partly by an inability to secure lethal injection drugs.",
      "The Supreme Court voted 5-4 in declining to step in.",
      "Hours earlier at a hearing Tuesday, a 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard \u201cChip\u201d Moore also declined to stop the execution. He agreed with the state's lawyers who had argued the man\u2019s religion-based arguments fell under the jurisdiction of a federal judge who had already ruled on them, according to local news outlets.",
      "Under the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama\u2019s, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.",
      "The protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate\u2019s heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.",
      "Two media witnesses to Tuesday's execution said Hoffman was covered with a gray plush blanket from the neck down. In the chamber with Hoffman was his spiritual advisor. Ahead of the execution and after the curtains closed to the viewing room, witnesses said they could hear Buddhist chanting.",
      "The gas began to flow at 6:21 p.m. and Hoffman started twitching, media witnesses said. His hands clenched and he had a \"slight head movement.\" Swanson said she closely watched the blanket over Hoffman's chest area and could see it rise and fall, indicating that he was breathing. She said his last visible breath appeared to be at 6:37 p.m. Shortly after, the curtains between the chamber and witness viewing room closed. When they reopened, Hoffman was pronounced dead.",
      "Seth Smith, chief of operations at the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, witnessed the execution and also acknowledged Hoffman's movements. Smith, who has a medical background, said he perceived the convulsions to be an \"involuntary response to dying\" and that Hoffman appeared to be unconscious at the time.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an Associated Press reporter. Alabama state officials said the reactions were involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation.",
      "Alabama first used nitrogen gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.",
      "Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center. Arkansas was added to the list on Tuesday.",
      "Seeking to resume executions, Louisiana\u2019s GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state\u2019s approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.",
      "On Tuesday, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation allowing executions using nitrogen gas, making hers the fifth state to adopt the method. Arkansas currently has 25 people on death row.",
      "Over recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state\u2019s executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and \u201cMeditation for Peace.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she expects at least four people to be executed this year in the state. Following Hoffman\u2019s execution, she said justice had been delayed for far too long and now Hoffman \u201dfaces the ultimate judgement, the judgement before God.\"",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- With Oklahomans still reeling from deadly wildfires that whipped across the state and destroyed hundreds of homes in recent days, authorities warned that Tuesday would bring a renewed risk of fire to an area spanning from western Oklahoma through the Texas Panhandle and into southeastern New Mexico.",
      "More than 400 homes were severely damaged or destroyed in the outbreak of wildfires that started Friday in Oklahoma. At least four people died due to the fires or high winds, including a person killed in a vehicle accident as a result of poor visibility due to dust or smoke, officials said.",
      "While calm weather over the weekend helped crews get a handle on most wildfires burning across Texas and Oklahoma, forecasters at the National Weather Service said extremely critical fire weather conditions were expected Tuesday in parts of Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.",
      "With wind gusts predicted to reach as high as 50 mph (80 kph) in the afternoon, along with dry conditions and \u201creceptive fuels,\u201d fires could spread rapidly, the weather service said.",
      "\u201cThese fires, once they get started, become really hard to stop,\u201d said Keith Merckx of Oklahoma Forestry Services. \u201cThey move more quickly than our resources can keep up with.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s no predictability or fairness about destroyed houses,\u201d Shufran said. \u201cThere\u2019s only two options for the homes in our neighborhood: standing or burned to the ground.\u201d",
      "Her home was one of more than 70 destroyed by wildfires in Stillwater, a city of about 50,000 about 65 miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Oklahoma City and home to Oklahoma State University.",

    "story": [
      "Santander has announced it is set to close 95 branches across the UK, putting 750 jobs at risk.",
      "The High Street bank said its customers were increasingly shifting to banking online and it aimed to start closing almost a quarter of its branches from June.",
      "As part of the changes, Santander will also reduce hours at 36 branches and remove the front counters from 18 others.",
      "It is the latest bank to announce branch closures, with Lloyds announcing 136 closures in January.",
      "The closures will leave Santander with 349 branches, down from 444.",
      "It said the areas to lose branches would be covered by 95 \"community bankers\" who will visit local communities on a weekly basis in facilities such as libraries.",
      "Santander said the changes were due to a \"a rapid movement of customers choosing to do their banking digitally\".",
      "It added digital transactions had increased by just under two thirds since 2019, with a similar drop for transactions in branches.",
      "\"Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimise the impact it may have on our customers,\" a Santander spokesperson said.",
      "About 750 staff will be at risk of redundancy if the proposals go ahead after consultation with the unions, the Spanish-owned bank said.",
      "Some MPs have criticised bank branch closures, saying they leave people in rural areas \"frozen out\".",
      "Santander said it would continue to open so-called \"work caf\u00e9s\", which are hubs where customers can access banking services, withdraw cash, and also use as a workspace.",

      "She said schemes to protect services such as banking hubs \"are a good start in plugging gaps left by closing physical branches\", but said they should be rolled out \"much more quickly if consumers are to feel their benefits\".",
      "The government \"must hold banks' feet to the fire\" to make sure commitments to set up 350 banking hubs by 2029 are met, and be prepared to push up that total if necessary, Ms Ross added.",
      "Banks and building societies must assess whether areas have reasonable access to cash when they close branches under UK rules.",
      "If not, they need to provide more facilities such as shared hubs before closing a branch.",

      "His case is one of the most high profile in the scandal in which hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully convicted after faulty software said money was missing from their branch accounts.",
      "Mr Castleton is seeking compensation, alleging the civil judgement against him was obtained by fraud. \"I want justice and to be publicly vindicated,\" he told the BBC.",

      "On Tuesday, Mr Castleton instructed his solicitors, Simons Muirhead Burton, to issue proceedings at the High Court against the Post Office and Fujitsu on his behalf.",
      "While other victims have seen their convictions overturned, Mr Castleton's civil judgement against him still stands.  His legal action is to set aside, or overturn, the judgement.",
      "\"I'd like to effectively have my day in court as well,\" said Mr Castleton who is due to receive his OBE next month.",
      "He told the BBC he has little faith in the compensation schemes the Post Office has set up to compensate the wrongfully convicted sub-postmasters that he wants his case to be heard in court instead.",
      "Mr Castleton never started the compensation scheme process, although he has received an interim payment.",

      "In 2007, Mr Castleton lost a two-year legal battle against the Post Office after it sued him to recover \u00a325,000 of cash it alleged was missing from his branch in Bridlington in East Yorkshire.",
      "When his legal insurance ran out, Mr Castleton had to represent himself in court and was landed with a bill of \u00a3321,000 in legal costs which he couldn't pay and declared bankruptcy.",
      "\"We now know from the Post Office Inquiry that they wanted to make an example of me,\" he said.",
      "\"Lee faced a David versus Goliath battle against the Post Office and we are fully ready to take this all the way to trial should we need to,\" says his lawyer, Simon Goldberg.",
      "During the public inquiry it emerged that that Fujitsu's log of known errors wasn't disclosed to Mr Castleton during his court proceedings.",
      "The application to the court in Lee's case will say that the Post Office, conspiring with others, withheld evidence about the unreliability of the Horizon system. A witness from Fujitsu also gave evidence in his case.",
      "\"What we're effectively going to be saying is that the claim against his was an abuse of process. It was never about recovery of the sum of money - it was to make an example of Mr Castleton\" says Mr Goldberg.",
      "\"We also believe the judgement was obtained by fraud in that the Post Office and Fujitsu knew perfectly well that the Horizon system wasn't working properly,\" he added."

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 01:27:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "Software engineer Jim Frazer, who did not vote for Trump, said the administration's assurances have done little to ease his concerns, as he sees policies change by the hour, the stock market sink, and prices for staples such as eggs rise.",

      "He and his wife recently hit pause on their plan to replace an old loveseat, and have scaled back their ambitions for renovating the bathroom.",

      "Monday brought some positive news. Official data said retail sales grew 4% in the first two months of 2025, a positive sign for consumption data. But, with a few exceptions like Shanghai aside, new and existing home prices continued to decline compared to last year.",
      "While the US and other major powers have struggled with post-Covid inflation, China is experiencing the opposite: deflation - when the rate of inflation falls below zero, meaning that prices decrease. In China, prices fell for 18 months in a row in the past two years.",
      "Prices dropping might sound like good news for consumers. But a persistent decline in consumption - a measure of what households buy - signals deeper economic trouble. When people stop spending, businesses cut prices to attract buyers. The more this happens, the less money they make, hiring slows, wages stagnate and economic momentum grinds to a halt.",
      "That is a cycle China wants to avoid, given it's already battling sluggish growth in the wake of a prolonged crisis in the property market, steep government debt and unemployment.",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "China says it is ready for 'any type of war' with US",
      "The cause of low consumption is straightforward: Chinese consumers either don't have enough money or don't feel confident enough about their future to spend it.",
      "But their reluctance comes at a critical moment. With the economy aiming to grow at 5% this year, boosting consumption is a top priority for President Xi Jinping. He is hoping that rising domestic consumption will absorb the blow US tariffs will inflict on Chinese exports.",
      "So, will Beijing's plan work?",
      "China is getting serious about spending",
      "To tackle its ailing economy and weak domestic demand, Beijing wrapped up its annual National People's Congress last week with increased investment in social welfare programmes as part of its grand economic plan for 2025.",
      "Then came this week's announcement with bigger promises, such as employment support plans, but scant details.",
      "Some say it is a welcome move, with the caveat that China's leaders need to do more to step up support. Still, it signals Beijing's awareness of the changes needed for a stronger Chinese consumer market - higher wages, a stronger social safety net and policies that make people feel secure enough to spend rather than save.",
      "A quarter of China's labour force is made up of low-paid migrant workers, who lack full access to urban social benefits. This makes them particularly vulnerable during periods of economic uncertainty, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Rising wages during the 2010s masked some of these problems, with average incomes growing by around 10% annually. But as wage growth slowed in the 2020s, savings once again became a lifeline.",
      "The Chinese government, however, has been slow to expand social benefits, focusing instead on boosting consumption through short-term measures, such as trade-in programmes for household appliances and electronics. But that has not addressed a root problem, says Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the Rand think tank: \"Household incomes are lower, and savings are higher\".",
      "The near-collapse of the property market has also made Chinese consumers more risk-averse, leading them to cut back on spending.",
      "\"The property market matters not only for real economic activity but also for household sentiment, since Chinese households have invested so much of their wealth in their homes,\" Mr DiPippo says. \"I don't think China's consumption will fully recover until it's clear that the property sector has bottomed out and therefore many households' primary assets are starting to recover.\"",
      "Some analysts are encouraged by Beijing's seriousness in targeting longer-term challenges like falling birth rates as more young couples opt out of the costs of parenthood.",
      "A 2024 study by Chinese think tank YuWa estimated that raising a child to adulthood in China costs 6.8 times the country's GDP per capita - among the highest in the world, compared to the US (4.1), Japan (4.3) and Germany (3.6).",
      "These financial pressures have only reinforced a deeply ingrained saving culture. Even in a struggling economy, Chinese households managed to save 32% of their disposable income in 2024.",
      "That's not too surprising in China, where consumption has never been particularly high. To put this in perspective, domestic consumption drives more than 80% of growth in the US and UK, and about 70% in India. China's share has typically ranged between 50% to 55% over the past decade.",
      "But this wasn't really a problem - until now.",
      "When shopping fell and savings rose",
      "There was a time when Chinese shoppers joked about the irresistible allure of e-commerce deals, calling themselves \"hand-choppers\" - only chopping off their hands could stop them from hitting the checkout button.",
      "As rising incomes fuelled their spending power, 11 November in China, or Double 11, came to be crowned as the world's busiest shopping day. Explosive sales pulled in over 410 billion yuan ($57bn; \u00a344bn) in just 24 hours in 2019.",
      "But the last one \"was a dud,\" a Beijing-based coffee bean online seller told the BBC.  \"If anything, it caused more trouble than it was worth.\"",
      "Chinese consumers have grown frugal since the pandemic, and this caution has persisted even after restrictions were lifted in late 2022.",
      "That's the year Alibaba and JD.com stopped publishing their sales figures, a significant shift for companies that once headlined their record-breaking revenues. A source familiar with the matter told the BBC that Chinese authorities cautioned platforms against releasing numbers, fearing that underwhelming results could further dent consumer confidence.",
      "The spending crunch has even hit high-end brands - last year, LVMH, Burberry and Richemont all reported sales declines in China, once a backbone of the global luxury market.",
      "On RedNote, a Chinese social media app, posts tagged with \"consumption downgrade\" have racked up more than a billion views in recent months. Users are swapping tips on how to replace expensive purchases with budget-friendly alternatives. \"Tiger Balm is the new coffee,\" said one user, while another quipped, \"I apply perfume between my nose and lips now \u2013 saving it just for myself.\"",
      "Even at its peak, China's consumer boom was never a match for its exports. Trade  was also the focus of generous state-backed investment in highways, ports and special economic zones. China relied on low-wage workers and high household savings, which fuelled growth but left consumers with limited disposable income.",
      "But now, as geopolitical uncertainties grow, countries are diversifying supply chains away from China, reducing reliance on Chinese exports. Local governments are burdened by debt, after years of borrowing heavily to invest, particularly in infrastructure.",
      "Xi Jinping has already vowed \"to make domestic demand the main driving force and stabilising anchor of growth\". Caiyun Wang, a National People's Congress representative, said, \"With a population of 1.4 billion, even a 1% rise in demand creates a market of 14 million people.\"",
      "But there's a catch in Beijing's plan.",
      "For consumption to drive growth, many analysts say, the Chinese Communist Party would have to restore the consumer confidence of a generation of Covid graduates that is struggling to own a home or find a job. It would also require triggering a cultural shift, from saving to spending.",
      "\"China's extraordinarily low consumption level is not an accident,\" according to Michael Pettis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"It is fundamental to the country's economic growth model, around which three-four decades of political, financial, legal and business institutions in China have evolved. Changing this won't be easy.\"",
      "The more households spend, the less there is in the pool of savings that China's state-controlled banks rely on to fund key industries - currently that includes AI and innovative tech that would give Beijing an edge over Washington, both economically and strategically.",
      "That is why some analysts doubt that China's leaders want to create a consumer-driven economy.",
      "\"One way to think about this is that Beijing's primary goal is not to enhance the welfare of Chinese households, but rather the welfare of the Chinese nation,\" David Lubin, a research fellow at Chatham House wrote.",
      "Shifting power from the state to the individual may not be what Beijing wants.",
      "China's leaders did do that in the past, when they began trading with the world, encouraging businesses and inviting foreign investment. And it transformed their economy. But the question is whether Xi Jinping wants to do that again.",

      "The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) is urging its members to take action because they have yet to receive any confirmation of an increase in funding for this or next financial year.",
      "Action could involve reducing their opening hours and cutting other services, such as delivering medicines to people's homes.",
      "The government said the move would cause \"unnecessary disruption for patients\" and a settlement with pharmacies was already being worked on.",

      "A pharmacy's NHS contract accounts for about 90% of its revenue, on average.",
      "And with increases in National Insurance, the National Living Wage and business rates, from 1 April, pharmacies say the lack of agreement over their contract is causing worry and uncertainty.",
      "This comes on top of a decade of cuts to funding, which has seen 30 pharmacies close since the start of this year, the NPA says.",
      "Some 3,000 pharmacy owners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland voted in favour of action, in November.",
      "This could involve cutting pharmacy opening times to 40 hours a week, which is the minimum set out in the current NHS contract, with shops less likely to be open at weekends and in the evenings.",

      "\"We want to get on with seeing patients, pay our staff, not have to think about closing, and invest in our business for the future.\"",
      "'Unnecessary disruption'",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said pharmacies had a vital role to play as the NHS's focus shifted away from hospitals and into the community - and negotiations over a contract were making progress.",

    "story": [
      "What happens today, here in Berlin, will impact the entire future of Europe's defence and its ongoing support for Ukraine.",
      "Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, is voting on whether to take the brakes off defence spending. This could pave the way for a massive uplift in military investment just as Russia makes gains in Ukraine and Washington signals that Europe can no longer rely on US protection.",
      "\"This vote in the Bundestag is absolutely crucial,\" says Prof Monika Schnitzer, who chairs Germany's Council of Economic Experts.",
      "\"After the Munich Security Conference, then the Trump-Zelensky row, Europe got a wake-up call. For the first time Europeans may not be able to rely on Washington. A lot of people had sleepless nights after that.\"",
      "\"The outlook for European defence spending hinges on developments in Germany, as the holder of the region's largest defence budget,\" agrees Dr Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defence economics at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Defence spending in Germany rose by 23.2% last year, helping to drive a record 11.7% rise in European defence outlay.",
      "\"The remarkable initiatives announced in Germany are key to enabling further growth,\" adds Dr McGerty.",
      "\"Without them, any progress made on strengthening Germany's military capability may have stalled.\"",
      "Germany's incoming new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is in a race against time.",
      "The new parliament convenes on 25 March and not everyone is in favour of all this money being spent, especially on defence.",
      "Both the far-right AfD party and the far-left Linke have vowed to oppose it. The vote needs two-thirds in favour to go through, so Merz has a better chance of this happening today, under the existing (old) parliament. It then needs to be approved by Germany's upper house.",
      "Meanwhile Europe is still coming to terms with the shock of announcements coming from the Trump administration.",
      "At last month's Munich Security Conference I watched as delegates sat open-mouthed listening to US Vice-President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on migration and free speech.",
      "This was preceded days earlier by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth telling Nato members that America's 80-year-long defensive umbrella for Europe should no longer be taken for granted.",
      "Defence strategists in Europe are already planning for the unthinkable: a semi-victorious Russia making gains in Ukraine, then rebuilding its army and threatening Nato's eastern members, such as the Baltic states, within three years or less.",
      "This, at a time when the US commitment to Europe's defence is looking extremely shaky. President Trump is being urged by some in his circle to pull US troops out of Europe and even to withdraw from Nato altogether.",
      "Historical caution",
      "There is talk of France extending its national nuclear deterrent to cover other European nations.",
      "Meanwhile, most European governments are under pressure to raise defence spending after years of cuts.",
      "The British Army has now shrunk to its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars, over 200 years ago, and experts predict it would run out of ammunition within two weeks of fighting a full-scale conventional war in Europe.",
      "Germany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.",
      "Which brings us back to today's crucial vote in the Bundestag. It is not just about defence. One part is about freeing up \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420bn) for German infrastructure \u2013 fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.",
      "The other part is about removing the restrictions in the constitution on borrowing that could, in theory, free up unlimited billions of euros for defence spending, both for Germany's armed forces and for a pan-European defence fund. On 4 March European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen announced plans for an \u20ac800bn defence fund called The ReArm Europe Fund.",
      "The proposal being voted on in Berlin is that any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP (national wealth) would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now this debt ceiling has been fixed at 0.35 pct of GDP.",
      "Other countries will be watching closely to see if this proposal passes. If it does not, then the EU Commission's 'ReArm Europe' project could be off to a shaky start.",
      "The challenge today for Europe's security is a stark one. If the US no longer has its back, or at the very least cannot be relied upon to come to Europe's defence, then what does the continent need to do to fill the gap?",
      "Let's start with the numbers. According to the Kiel Institute, which meticulously tracks these things, Europe spends just 0.1% of its wealth on helping to defend Ukraine, while the US has been spending 0.15%.",
      "\"That means,\" says the Kiel Institute's Giuseppe Irto, \"that if Europe is to make up the shortfall then it needs to double its contribution to 0.21%.\"",
      "But regardless of what happens today in Berlin this is not just about money.",
      "Many of the most sought-after weapons in Ukraine's armoury have come from the US, like Patriot air defence and long-range artillery systems like Himars. The Kiel Institute puts the proportion of Ukraine's rocket artillery at 86% coming from the US, with 82% of its howitzer ammunition also being US-sourced.",
      "Then there is the whole question of US intelligence aid for Kyiv, much of it derived from satellites and geospatial imagery. If Washington were to permanently switch that off, then Ukrainian forces risk being partially blinded.",
      "If America's nuclear arsenal is taken out of the equation then there is a massive disparity between Russia's 5,000-plus warheads and the combined total of Britain and France's nukes which amount to less than a tenth of that. But that still theoretically leaves enough to act as a nuclear deterrent.",
      "Culture shift",
      "When it comes to \"conventional\", ie. non-nuclear arms, Western defence chiefs are fond of saying that Nato's combined forces are superior to Russia's.",
      "Maybe, but if there is one glaring lesson to come out of the Ukraine war it is that \"mass\" matters. Russia's army may be of poor quality but President Putin has been able to throw such huge numbers of men, drones, shells and missiles at Ukraine's front lines that the Russians are inexorably advancing, albeit slowly and at huge cost.",
      "This should not come as a surprise. Moscow put its economy on to a war footing some time ago. It appointed an economist as its defence minister and retooled many of its factories to churn out vast quantities of munitions, especially explosive-tipped drones.",
      "While many European nations have dragged their feet over raising defence spending much above the Nato-mandated 2% of GDP, Russia's is closer to 7%. Around 40% of Russia's national budget is spent on defence.",
      "So Europe has a fair bit of catching up to do if it is to even come close to shoring up its defence and security.",
      "\"If the vote passes then it will be significant for Germany and for Europe,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank.",
      "\"It will set a precedent and allow others to follow... However, three years on from the invasion of Ukraine the case of Germany is a reminder that more money for defence is necessary but not sufficient.",

      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

      "The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\".",
      "Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\".",
      "\"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also spoke about reducing the duplication of work done by regulators.",
      "'Global headwinds'",
      "In its latest forecast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4% in 2025, from its previous forecast of 1.7%, and to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1.3%.",
      "However, the forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of England, which earlier this month cut its UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.75%.",
      "Economic forecasts are not always accurate but predictions from the OECD are looked at closely.",
      "The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\"",
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\"",
      "Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion.",
      "Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed.",

    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",

      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "From April, slots will be limited to \u00a35 per spin for over 25s. In May, 18-24-year-olds will be limited to \u00a32 per spin.",
      "This follows a government review of the 2005 Gambling Act, and the publication of a white paper which introduces new measures to strengthen gambling harm legislation.",
      "Online slots are web versions of slot machines you see in a casino. The punter enters money and spins a wheel. If the symbols or pictures match, they could win money.",
      "The government said it was bringing in stake limits for them because they are \"a higher-risk gambling product associated with large losses, long sessions, and binge play\".",
      "But in a new documentary series on Radio 4, Stewart Kenny, who resigned from the board of the betting company in 2016, says the speed of the games is what makes them addictive.",
      "He says the gap between investment and results being \"only seconds\" means punters can \"repeat the dose\" at high speed.",
      "In addition to this, he says the machines provide \"plenty of noise and plenty of colours\", as well as near misses, which are \"fundamental to gambling addiction\".",
      "The Department for Culture Media and Sport said the Gambling Commission introduced requirements that changed speed and intensity of slots in 2021: \"This included a minimum speed of 2.5 seconds per spin, a ban on autoplay and features that increase play intensity, such as turbo, quick spin and slam stop, or give the illusion of 'false wins'.\"",
      "Gambling companies make a significant proportion of their profits from online slots. Acording to market data collected by the Gambling Commission up to December 2024, the profits from slots increased 15% year on year to a new high of \u00a3709m. The number of spins increased 9% in the previous quarter to a new peak of \u00a323.9bn.",
      "Paddy Power merged with another betting brand, Betfair, and under the name Flutter Entertainment, is now one of the biggest betting companies in the world.",
      "Stewart Kenny resigned from the board of Flutter, saying he felt the company was not doing enough to protect vulnerable customers using its websites.",
      "Mr Kenny no longer has any financial interest with the company, and receives no payment for taking part in the programmes.",
      "In the documentary series Changing the Odds, Mr Kenny teams up with journalist Lydia Thomas, who has reported on the betting industry for a decade, to chart 20 years since the 2005 Gambling Act. The act paved the way for the UK betting industry to revolutionise gambling and take it online.",
      "For many years, the UK has been the biggest online betting market in the world \u2013 with the industry worth \u00a315.6bn. Only recently has the United States overtaken as more states allow online gambling.",
      "And it is the move online that sparked Mr Kenny's worries when he was sitting on the board. He believes the internet by its very nature can be addictive and that adding online casinos in the mix has \"made the cocktail too strong\".",
      "Mr Kenny still enjoys gambling, and regularly bets on horse and dog racing, which he believes is a less addictive gambling product. But he criticises the industry for encouraging sports betting punters to move to online slots.",
      "\"I have always said I have been very relaxed about my kids opening up betting accounts. But, I would be horrified if my grandchildren open up a betting account.",
      "\"What the bookmakers do is, when you open a betting account at the age of 18 to have a bet, and you're a kid and you want to have a fiver on your local team, within 48 hours, the bookmakers will try and suck you into the highly addictive online casino by sending you free spins.\"",
      "Mr Kenny believes it is up to the government and regulators to make gambling safe.",
      "\"There's a balance here. If you want to bet, you should be allowed to bet. It's a free society. So you don't want to interfere with people's entertainment too much.  It's so easy to blame the betting companies. This is a matter for legislators.\"",
      "Flutter Entertainment said it recognised that the gambling industry had not always got things right in the past but said its UK business had \"evolved significantly in the years since Stewart's involvement, which ended over eight years ago\".",
      "It said in that time, it had been \"a vocal and constructive supporter\" of the Gambling Act Review and the white paper, while \"leading the industry on proactive change\" with its introduction of deposit limits for under-25s and the setting of a \u00a310 stake limit on online slot products.",
      "\"We were pleased that some of these measures were publicly praised by Stewart as we respect his views.\"",
      "Gambling industry body The Betting and Gaming Council said: \"Each month, around 22.5 million people in Britain enjoy a bet and the overwhelming majority do so safely and responsibly. The BGC supported plans to reform stake limits and introduce a mandatory levy to fund research, prevention and treatment.",
      "\"The white paper is a once-in-a-generation moment for change and the proposals contained in it must draw a line under the lengthy and often polarised debates on gambling.\"",

      "\"It's about having your eggs in one basket. And right now, that basket is very reckless and very precarious,\" she continues.",
      "On a tour around one of her firm's two stores, housed in a giant warehouse, Ms Goodman highlights elegantly made-up beds, mannequins in silk pyjamas, and shelves full of sweet-smelling candles \u2013 most of it made in Canada.",
      "But one fifth of the stock currently comes from the US. Ms Goodman is quick to point out, \"you see how big the store is, so even 20% is a lot\".",
      "\"I have a lot of inventory here of American brands that I've had relationships with for 20 years. I'm not going to throw it away,\" she says. \"The question is, will I reorder?\"",
      "To show Au Lit Fine Linens' commitment to Canadian manufacturers, its stores now highlight everything that is Canadian made. This is mirrored on its website, which has a \"shop all made in Canada\" section, and says \"made right here at home\".",

      "Bringing business operations back to home shores, it is the reversal of offshoring.",
      "Business leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is \"really obvious\" to support.",
      "Pupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade \"went right out the window\".",
      "She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.",
      "In that moment Pupatello thought: \"We've got to be prepared for the worst\".",
      "Shortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada.",
      "Pupatello tells the BBC: \"If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it.\"",
      "A Canadian government report from last year found that there had \"not been signs of either large-scale or any notable increased reshoring by businesses\", but things could now be changing.",
      "Ray Brougham has been trying to make inroads into the Canadian car manufacturing sector since establishing his company Rainhouse Manufacturing Canada in 2001. Based in British Columbia, it manufactures parts for a number of industries.",
      "The North American car industry's integrated supply chains can see parts crossing the borders between the US, Mexico, and Canada multiple times before a vehicle is finally assembled.",
      "US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March.",
      "But in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had \"good communications\" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. \"All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies.\"",
      "For Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods.",
      "Others, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces.",
      "His Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border.",
      "Canada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas.",
      "\"We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,\" says Mr Markham.",
      "From critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.",
      "\"Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.\"",
      "So, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada?  Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell.",
      "\"There's a lot more smoke than there is fire when it comes to actual reorganisation of supply chains and moving them domestically,\" says Mr Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Quebec-based Desjardins.",
      "\"I think there has been some movement toward reshoring, but I think there's a lot more narrative around it than there is actual re-establishing of manufacturing capacity.\"",
      "There are major hurdles too.",
      "The highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require \"many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen\", according to Mr Bartlett.",
      "Then there's the reality of global trade.",
      "\"Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,\" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.",
      "He says that Canada should focus on \"those industries where we have a comparative advantage\", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.",
      "Back at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed.",
      "\"We're shipping orders to the US that came in pre-tariffs,\" she explains, before pausing.  \"We did get an order the day of the tariffs starting, and it was a very decent-sized order.\"",

      "As for what comes next?  \"These tariffs could be gone any day. Let's see how it all unfolds, then we'll start making decisions,\" says Ms Goodman.",
      "Like many Canadian businesses, she's waiting for the dust to settle before deciding where to buy, where to sell, and what Made in Canada really means for the future."

      "She takes the hour-long train into her company's Vilnius office once a week, where she uses a car-sharing service to drive herself to client meetings throughout the day.",
      "Through an app, she can find where the nearest available car is, and drive off, paying by the minute - a system she finds convenient and flexible.",
      "Some providers even include parking in the price, and if she takes an electric car, it's even better, as they qualify for free parking around the city.",
      "\"The ability to move around a big city quickly, and not worry about parking, helps me have a more flexible schedule and better control of my time,\" says Ms Mackeviciute, 30, who works in communications.",
      "Yet despite being a regular car-sharing user, Ms Mackeviciute still owns a car in Kaunas, which she regularly uses for visiting family living in the countryside. And even while working in Vilnius, occasional issues with car sharing can disrupt Ms Mackeviciute's day.",
      "\"It can sometimes be hard to find a vehicle nearby. And sometimes, when you're in a rush the closest vehicle can have not one, but a few, maintenance lights on. While I do understand that fleet maintenance is a challenge, especially as a business grows, it is still disappointing,\" she says.",
      "When it comes to cars, most people feel like Ms Mackeviciute - they still want to own one.",
      "Despite brands like Zipcar being around since 2000, industry data shows car sharing to still be a niche service.",
      "There are just two million car sharing users in the UK, while around 35 million people still own a car.",
      "\"Consumers are still tied to exclusive access to their car. Clear scepticism about the ability for car-sharing options to provide a car to hand whenever they need it, and concerns about hassle, are the biggest issues,\" explains Felicity Latcham, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants.",
      "\"This concern gets greater for families and older individuals who are particularly tied to being able to leave things in their vehicle.\"",
      "But the growing electrification of the car sharing market might be attractive to younger, eco-conscious drivers.",
      "In a 2023 McKinsey survey of 4,000 people in the UK, France and Germany, 32% of those in the Gen Z bracket said they wanted to use shared-mobility schemes more, wishing to reduce private car reliance.",
      "The survey also suggested that 50% of Gen Z also want their next car to be fully electric.",
      "The car-sharing industry is heading in that direction.",
      "Almost a quarter of European car sharing companies now offer a 100% electric fleet.",
      "A third of shared cars in the EU are electric vehicles, data from Statista shows. Meanwhile, Zipcar doubled its electric fleet in 2023 in the UK, with plans to go fully electric this year.",
      "Spark, the Lithuanian car-sharing company Ms Mackeviciute frequently uses, launched with a fully electric fleet in 2016.",
      "Its recent performance has been encouraging, with a registered user base up by 30% since 2022, and annual trip numbers up by 11%.",
      "Since July last year, users of the Bolt ride-sharing app - the Baltic states' answer to Uber - can also now book Spark vehicles.",
      "Spark founder Nerijus Dagilis is confident that the increasing availability of electric vehicles can get more people on board with car sharing, especially with the support of the city of Vilnius, which, on top of free parking for electric cars, allows them to be driven in bus lanes, too.",
      "\"Our customer pool is increasing every month, so that means we are creating a certain value for people, who prefer electric cars for sustainability reasons. It's becoming a daily habit for many people, especially families - we see more of them downsizing from two cars to one,\" says Mr Dagilis.",
      "\"The performance of electric cars is improving quickly, so while there is still some scepticism, as soon as an electric car can drive 500km on a single charge, I think people's anxiety should disappear.\"",
      "Canada's Kite is a car sharing company with a twist. Not only is it fully electric, but it partners with property developers to offer Kite cars to apartment building residents as either an included service, or for a subsidised membership fee, akin to a gym or pool.",
      "A Kite hub is installed usually on the first level of the building's underground parking, for residents to book their choice of up to 40 fully charged electric cars.",
      "In some locations, Kite users have the option of returning their car to a different building. Kite is currently live in 20 buildings across Canada, with plans to add 70 more in the next 18 months, adding properties in the US and Europe.",
      "Kite founder, Scott MacWillam, says the convenience and saving they offer to prospective residents is a draw.",

      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",

      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",

      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "summary": "Plans to axe a fifth of the workforce at Dundee University have drawn attention to problems in the sector.",
    "story": [
      "Scotland's universities are hitting a crunch point with their finances, forcing job losses on a scale we used to see from major factory closures and raising questions about whether they can all survive.",
      "Dundee University is cutting 632 full-time jobs \u2013 a fifth of its workforce - as it tries to tackle a \u00a335m deficit, and its underlying financial position looks even worse.",
      "The University of Edinburgh is looking to make \u00a3140m of cuts over the next 18 months. That figure is equivalent to about a tenth of the annual spending at the institution, which now has about 15,000 staff on its payroll.",
      "Aberdeen University has also cut staff through voluntary redundancy programmes, while the city's Robert Gordon University has put 135 roles \"at risk\" - which usually means they are bound to go.",
      "It has been suggested that more than 80 universities across the UK face deficits of between \u00a310m and \u00a350m, with Durham and Cardiff both planning significant spending cuts.",
      "When the Scottish Funding Council publishes its delayed annual assessment of the sector, it is expected to say that more than half of Scotland's institutions are running a deficit.",
      "They all face similar pressures, but some have done better than others at foreseeing the danger and planning for it.",
      "So what are the challenges facing the sector in Scotland?",
      "The level of student funding",
      "Scottish students get \"free tuition\". Undergraduates don't have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.",
      "The Scottish government has committed to pay the tuition costs, which it does through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).",
      "Universities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.",
      "It says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.",
      "The figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.",
      "It says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.",
      "While the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.",
      "But that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.",
      "Using a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.",
      "The IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.",
      "How does that compare with elsewhere?",
      "Undergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.",
      "These are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.",
      "Students from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.",
      "While the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.",
      "However, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.",
      "The maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.",
      "Because England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.",
      "The more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.",
      "The vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.",
      "With these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.",
      "The overseas recruitment drive",
      "UK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "The number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.",
      "The most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",
      "It has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.",
      "Growth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.",
      "It fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.",
      "The volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.",
      "A growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.",
      "Chinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.",
      "Nigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.",
      "But the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.",
      "Dundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.",
      "Numbers were also affected by visa restrictions.",
      "In order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.",
      "It also restricted visas for students' family dependents.",
      "The biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.",
      "These tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.",
      "Some international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.",
      "A further factor is that competition has been growing.",
      "The UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.",
      "That now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.",
      "What about spending?",
      "To increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.",
      "And with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.",
      "Ten years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.",
      "In 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.",
      "That level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.",
      "It becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "An external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.",
      "Its interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".",
      "Dundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.",
      "Subjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.",
      "Language departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.",
      "The Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.",
      "But money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.",
      "Dundee University to cut 632 jobs to plug \u00a335m deficit",
      "Edinburgh University to seek \u00a3140m in savings",
      "Record foreign student numbers at Scottish universities",
      "Some see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.",
      "Others see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.",
      "And there may be value in a crisis such as this.",
      "With a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.",
      "On funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.",
      "What comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.",
      "In the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.",
      "Scotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change."

      "Six years ago, Amber Clare was a devoted One Direction fan.",
      "Scrolling through Twitter for information about the band's solo projects, she saw a reply that said \"Listen to Icy by Itzy\".",
      "Intrigued, she clicked on the link. It changed her life.",
      "\"I'd never listened to K-Pop before that point but I immediately became a fan,\" she says.",
      "\"And now Itzy is the reason I have my job.\"",
      "Today, Clare is the marketing and social media manager for K-Stars, the UK's first and biggest shop devoted to Korean pop music.",
      "Based in Manchester, it started as a small business in Manchester's Affleck's Palace in 2019.",
      "\"You'd order things by PayPal, and then the CEO would pack them up by himself and ship everything out,\" Clare recalls.",
      "Now it's a two-storey emporium, based on Deansgate, with a staff of more than 20 dedicated K-Pop enthusiasts.",
      "It's a sign of how the genre has exploded in the UK, even though radio and television has largely shunned all but the biggest acts, like BTS, aespa and Blackpink.",
      "\"It's still kind of a niche - but it's not a small niche,\" says Clare. \"In my head I'm the only Itzy fan, but when I went to see them in concert, it was sold out.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wow, where have all you people been hiding?'\"",
      "In fact, the UK is now among the top 10 countries that follow K-Pop on Spotify, with the boyband Ateez placing two records in the top five of the UK album charts last year.",
      "This summer, Blackpink will play two nights at Wembley Stadium, with Stray Kids pulling off the same feat in Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Twickenham Stadium will say \"anyong haseyo\" to one of K-pop's longest-running festivals.",
      "Established in 2008, the SM Town Live festival is a showcase for artists signed to the SM Entertainment Label, one of the industry's key players.",
      "To celebrate the company\u2019s 30th anniversary, they're transplanting the event from Seoul to Middlesex.",
      "\"It's essentially a multi-day festival all in one, because you've got so many artists all at the same venue, jam packed into the space of three or four hours,\" says Reese Carter, of boyband Dear Alice, who'll be among the performers in Twickenham.",
      "\"It's non-stop. You've got to prep yourself, because you'll definitely want to dance.\"",
      "\"It's very down to earth but it goes straight to your heart,\" adds Ten from K-Pop group WayV.",
      "Targeting the UK",
      "SM holds a unique place in Korea's musical history. Founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man, it is widely credited with establishing the K-Pop template.",
      "It was the first company to introduce the trainee system, where young talent goes through intensive training that lasts months, or even years, before making their \"debut\".",
      "And it dominated what's known as the \"first generation\" of K-Pop idols, with bands like H.O.T. and S.E.S.",
      "The Twickenham show will pay tribute to that three-decade journey, with a line-up that includes everyone from Red Velvet, EXO and Girl's Generation to current chart-toppers like aespa, Riize and all of the sub-units of boyband NCT - which boasts more than 20 members.",
      "\"That's very rare,\" says Ten, one of the group's most recognisable (and chatty) stars.",
      "\"The last time we had an NCT concert as a whole was two years ago. It's so difficult to schedule every group to be in the same spot at the same time.\"",
      "But that's not all. The concert will also feature what's been billed as \"a group of promising trainees\", known for now as SMTR25 \u2013 showcasing the future of the label.",
      "\"Performing alongside the senior artists we've admired since our trainee days, as well as our talented junior artists, makes this an incredibly meaningful experience for us,\" said aespa in an email to the BBC.",
      "The hope is that shows like this will open a few doors - because, for all the strides K-Pop has made in the last couple of years, bands have consistently prioritised America over Europe.",
      "It's a logical step. The US is the world's biggest music market, so it offers more opportunities for touring and merchandise sales, while an MTV Award performance or a concert for NPR's Tiny Desk series travels further internationally than an appearance at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The situation here isn't as good as what the American industry gets,\" acknowledges Amber Clare.",
      "\"Every single K-Pop group, if they announce a world tour, America will always be on the map - but European countries are always left wondering if they're going to be included or not.\"",
      "Things are changing, though.",
      "In a crowded market, labels are increasingly turning their attention to the UK \u2013 where the anglophone media has international reach, and there's a baked-in affection for boy and girl groups like Take That, Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.",
      "To make inroads, bands have teamed up with some of Britain's biggest artists.",
      "Aespa's 2023 single Better Things was co-written by Raye, while Le Sserafim collaborated with PinkPantheress on club anthem Crazy and with Jungle on their latest song, Come Over.",
      "Last year, SM went one further \u2013 creating a British boyband and putting them through the K-Pop machinery.",
      "That group was Dear Alice, whose gruelling traineeship was documented in BBC series Made In Korea.",
      "Having survived the process, the five-piece finally premiered their debut single, Ariana, at a massive SM Town concert in Seoul in January.",
      "\"These shows are timed down to the second,\" says singer Blaise Noon. \"When we got our time to go on stage, it was literally like, 8:30 and 48 seconds. It just shows how so well thought out is.\"",
      "Bringing the production to London is evidence that SM has its sights trained on the UK, he confirms.",
      "\"In the UK, we produce some really amazing boy groups, so I think we have that connection in the culture. So I think they definitely want to hit it. I can see it getting bigger and bigger every day.\"",
      "Ten, who releases a new solo album, Stunner, next week, says he's already experienced the devotion of UK fans.",
      "When his group WayV last visited England in 2023, \"we were surprised that people could sing along to our songs, because we sing in Chinese\", he says.",
      "\"This opportunity with SM Town, I feel like it's going to open a bigger market for K-Pop in the UK.",
      "\"I hope so, because I'd like to come and perform my solo stuff to my UK fans too.\"",
      "The opportunity is there.",
      "Nine of the 10 best-selling albums in the world last year were by South Korean artists, illustrating the music's broad appeal - but none of those records charted in the UK\u2019s Top 50.",
      "Lack of radio exposure is one factor - but listeners can also be put off by clunky English lyrics or the sudden-but-deliberate stylistic shifts that characterise K-Pop.",
      "If you're willing to dig into the genre, though, you can find some of the most audacious and indelible hooks music has to offer.",
      "One by-product of K-pop\u2019s (relative) obscurity is the bond it creates among fans. There's a sense of belonging that comes from discovering and nurturing your \"bias\", outside the glare of the mainstream.",
      "It\u2019s a relationship bands foster by a fire hose stream of social media content, where dance challenges, video diaries and photoshoots are posted daily.",
      "Dear Alice experienced the impact of that effort at a UK meet-and-greet last weekend.",
      "\"It felt like we were hanging out with a bunch of our mates,\" says Dexter Greenwood.",
      "\"They were just cool people,\" adds James Sharp. \"We're starting to recognise faces and remember people on this journey - and I think there's going to be more and more.\"",

    "summary": "The BBC hears how five raiders escaped with a \u00a34.8m gold toilet, as told by Blenheim Palace staff.",
    "story": [
      "In the early hours of 14 September 2019, Eleanor Paice jolted awake to the sound of smashing glass.",
      "Living in a staff flat above Blenheim Palace, the guest services supervisor was used to strange noises. But when fire alarms began to blare, she knew something was wrong.",
      "She quickly began evacuating to the great courtyard. But unbeknown to her, she was running straight into the final moments of an audacious heist.",
      "Five men had smashed their way into the palace, ripped out a \u00a34.8m solid gold toilet and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.",
      "The working loo, entitled America, had been on display for just two days at the 18th Century stately home, plumbed in as part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "Now, more than five years on, a total of three men have been convicted in connection to the heist.",
      "James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024, while Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday.",
      "Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, was cleared of the same charge.",
      "It was a crime that intrigued art lovers, delighted the press and coined countless potty-themed puns.",
      "Now, the BBC has gained exclusive behind-the-scenes access to staff at Blenheim Palace to understand the heist and security failures from their perspective.",
      "'We've been hit'",
      "It was the night before, Blenheim chief executive Dominic Hare was at a glamorous exhibition launch party being held at the palace, hosted by Cattelan himself.",
      "It was America's first time on display outside of New York and the artwork's presence was creating a buzz.",
      "He remembers slipping away from the festivities, hoping for a turn on the fully usable toilet. But when confronted with a line, he told himself \"that's okay, there's no point queuing. You can come back tomorrow and have a look\".",
      "But just a few hours later, his colleague Ms Paice was witnessing the final moments as the 98kg (216lbs) artwork was being heaved into a boot.",
      "She recalls a confusing and fast-moving scene: \"It was just shadows and quick movement. I just saw them move towards the car, get in the car\u2026.and then the car just sped straight off.\"",
      "From the burglars entering and exiting the courtyard, the audacious heist had taken just five minutes.",
      "Gang guilty over \u00a34.8m gold toilet heist",
      "CCTV of theft of \u00a34.8m gold toilet shown in court",
      "Man pleads guilty to golden toilet palace theft",
      "Police arrived shortly after, and it was only when staff searched the palace they realised what had been stolen.",
      "\"That was when... I felt my stomach drop,\" Ms Paice says. \"And I thought, this is big.\"",
      "Soon, the chief executive's phone was buzzing him awake: \"Dom, we've been hit.\"",
      "He said it took him a few moments to realise he was not dreaming before rushing to the palace.",
      "His relief that staff were unharmed then mingled with the horror of a flooded, shattered crime scene.",
      "\"If the golden toilet in situ had looked beautiful and perfect and majestic and untainted, this was the total opposite,\" Mr Hare said. \"This was brutalised, smashed up. This is a palace. Palaces don't get smashed up\".",
      "When the palace reopened a day later, the controversy was addressed with a theatrical flourish.",
      "Staff re-strung police tape across the shattered cubicle, just metres from the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, and exhibited the crime scene as part of the now toilet-less Cattelan show.",
      "Mr Hare said despite his embarrassment, his anger had prompted him to keep it visible but he also realised it could be a draw to the public.",
      "It worked. In the following days Ms Paice said the palace was \"slammed\", with hordes wanting to glimpse the destruction.",
      "\"People were more interested to see where the golden toilet had been stolen from than to come and see the golden toilet itself,\" she added.",
      "Security failures",
      "Palace staff say they did see the humour in how the press and public approached the crime, but they were still deeply rattled by the raid.",
      "Ms Paice said Blenheim, a safe and secure home for her, did not feel \"settled in the same way\" for a long time.",
      "\"There was always this anxiousness. If that's happened, anything could happen,\" she said.",
      "Mr Hare said he felt both emotional and grateful no-one was harmed, calling the burglars the \"most dangerous people who'd ever visited Blenheim Palace\".",
      "\"That toilet survived New York City. And if it survived New York City, it should have survived Blenheim Palace,\" says Christopher Marinello, an art recovery lawyer brought in by insurers to look at the case.",
      "In his view, Blenheim's security \"failed miserably\".",
      "What is strikingly clear from interviews with palace staff, the 18-carat gold toilet had not been deemed a security risk.",
      "A month before the burglary, Edward Spencer-Churchill, the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, told the Sunday Times: \"It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick.",
      "\"Firstly, it's plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don't plan to be guarding it.\"",
      "Mr Hare said they were \"far more worried\" about other controversial artworks in the exhibition - a statue of a meteor-struck pope, union flags the public walked on and a statue of a praying Adolf Hitler.",
      "He admitted the toilet's status as a quirky art object had eclipsed the fact it was worth \u00a32.8m in gold alone.",
      "It was left unguarded during closing hours, with no CCTV monitoring the cubicle door.",
      "But the gang exploited other security flaws that night, including no patrols and easily breached gates.",
      "Even after the raid, staff did not immediately realise the toilet had been the target.",
      "Ms Paice says she fleetingly imagined they had come for Churchill's childhood lock of hair, which the palace displays.",
      "'Not vulnerable anymore'",
      "In the weeks that followed, Mr Hare was motivated to overhaul security at top speed.",
      "He took full responsibility for the failures that night.",
      "\"It's not a democratic decision that we had a certain level of security, it was really mine. In that sense I made Blenheim vulnerable. And we are not vulnerable anymore,\" he said.",
      "The palace has seen its security overhauled with a \"very significant upgrade\", while it has also been a wake-up call for other stately homes.",
      "The stolen gold has never been recovered but the story will live on as a quirky footnote in the history of one of Britain's most popular palaces.",
      "\"There's big and serious history here, wars which changed the course of history on a continent. Put it against that, it's small fry,\" Mr Hare remarked.",
      "\"[But] in the histories of the normal people of Blenheim, the people who've lived here and breathed life into this place, it was a very threatening moment.",
      "\"I can imagine guides in 150 years' time, it's the sort of story they might refer to.\"",
      "Gang guilty over \u00a34.8m gold toilet heist",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:37:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Herbie Hancock on 80 years of playing the piano and being this year's recipient of the Polar Music Prize.",
    "story": [
      "Herbie Hancock is an all-time jazz great, so it is reassuring to hear that he suffers from the same modern day procrastination problems as the rest of us mere mortals.",
      "\"I fall into rabbit holes on YouTube. A lot of them. New music writing software, things about health, tech things.\"",
      "That is his explanation as to why he has not made an album for 15 years.",
      "\"I get victimised by it, so to speak, but that's life,\" he chuckles.",
      "Speaking from his house in west Hollywood, the ridiculously sprightly 84-year-old pianist has never been afraid to embrace technology, but normally he is the one doing the mastering, not vice versa.",
      "Hancock's half century... and more",
      "Discovered by trumpeter Donald Byrd at the start of the 60s, Hancock signed to Blue Note Records, and wrote jazz standards including Watermelon Man, Cantaloupe Island and Maiden Voyage.",
      "In the 70s he was an early adopter of synthesisers, blending genres with the electro-funk classic Head Hunters.",
      "In the 80s, he had a bona fide worldwide hit single with Rockit after embracing turntablism and scratching, winning five awards at the first ever MTV Awards for its classic dancing robots video.",
      "Deee Lite's Groove Is in the Heart? The riff that drives that song is a sample from Hancock's Blow-Up soundtrack. Madonna, Janet Jackson and NWA are among the plethora of performers to have incorporated his music into their own.",
      "As recently as 2008, he beat Amy Winehouse and Kanye West to win his first album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "The reason we are talking is that Hancock has been announced as one of the recipients of this year's Polar Music Prize, the closest music has to a Nobel prize.",
      "Previous laureates have included Sir Paul McCartney, Dizzy Gillespie, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Quincy Jones.",
      "\"It's a huge, fantastic list of people I've admired,\" says Hancock before expressing particular delight that the saxophonist Wayne Shorter was chosen for the honour in 2017, six years before his death. Together they made up two fifths of Miles Davis's Second Great Quintet.",
      "Working with Miles Davis",
      "Joy comes over Hancock's face when reminiscing about the period between 1964 to 1968, when he toured the world with the man Rolling Stone magazine called \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time\".",
      "\"I was always frightened playing with Miles,\" he laughs.",
      "\"It was very intimidating. I always wanted to be at my best, because I admired him so much. He was such a big part in my own development as a musician.",
      "\"It was fear on one hand. On the other hand, it was exciting. And when things were at their best, it was really inspiring. When were all in sync, that made life worth living.\"",
      "On the pianist's favourite distraction, YouTube, there is a clip that has been viewed almost five million times, showing a furious Davis, on stage in Milan in 1964, stopping his improvised solo to send dagger eyes at Hancock.",
      "Online there is much debate as to what caused this trumpet temper tantrum. But for Hancock, this was a regular occurrence.",
      "\"A lot of times I would be surprised at what would upset Miles, what would make him a little angry. I didn't always know. He was not always easy to figure out, so I got used to that slight discomfort,\" he says grinning.",
      "\"That's life. But I was always looking to learn from those discomforts.\"",
      "And when he embarks on his European tour this summer, which includes three UK dates at London's Barbican, Hancock will be thinking about another lesson he learnt from Davis - this one about the make-up of his audience.",
      "He adopts a low, deep whispering voice and does a full-on Miles Davis impression, recreating the conversation from the mid 1960s, when the trumpeter gave him a stern warning: \"If all you see are dudes in the audience, that means your music is dead.\"",
      "Herbie Hancock is pretending to be Miles Davis to an audience of me. It is a glorious moment.",
      "\"He used more expletives than I just did,\" Hancock chortles. \"But you get the idea,\" clearly enjoying his mimicry as much as I did.",
      "Hancock has been playing the piano for almost 80 years, but the instrument still gives him so much joy, that on occasion, during a session on the keys, he finds himself sobbing.",
      "\"If I've solved some kind of problem that I've had with the tune and made some kind of discovery that surpassed my expectations, I've been known to cry, to have tears coming down my face.\"",
      "I ask what kind of problem leaves him reaching for Herbie hankies.",
      "\"It's difficult to explain,\" he responds, \"But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?'\"",
      "It feels like we have been invited inside Hancock's brain and are seeing the cogs turn. At speed.",
      "He continues: \"There may be something that I want to connect, but all the ways I know of connecting them are not the solution. And I have to find some other means.",
      "\"And sometimes that [means] can come from looking at it in a different way. And not necessarily through music.\"",
      "This answer goes a long way to explaining the difference between someone who is a musical genius and someone who is not.",
      "Hancock went to college to study electrical engineering, so it is no surprise that he has taken a huge interest in the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "He believes our fears about the technology are overblown, and says he prefers to \"embrace it\". Hancock acknowledges concerns that AI lacks an ethical framework but asks: \"Who are the worst examples of understanding ethics and being able to live a life with ethics? We, human beings, we're the worst, right?\"",
      "He is on a roll now.",
      "\"I have this feeling that AI is going to help us all understand and get closer to becoming more ethically responsible people that are helping each other, instead of hurting or killing each other. Helping the planet instead of killing the planet with environmental issues.\"",
      "And the man who once released an album called Future Shock, has some simple advice for us all.",
      "\"When I'm using ChatGPT or Siri on my iPhone, I always say thank you and they usually say, 'You're welcome.'\"",
      "\"I try to treat AI like it's human and it actually manifests itself in an extremely positive way and that makes me feel better.\"",
      "At the age of 84, Herbie Hancock is still determined to try and future-proof himself, by getting the robots on his side.",
      "Finally, I ask him a question on behalf of parents all round the world. My 11-year-old Charlie loves playing the piano, but hates practising. What advice would he give anyone in that situation?",
      "He nods.",
      "\"I understand your pain. I don't like practising either.\"",
      "Hancock, pauses and thinks before adding: \"But you know, I look at it as, 'OK, this is something, even if I don't want to do it, I need to do it.' And once I get into it, then I feel like I've conquered an obstacle in my life.\"",
      "He pauses again, before concluding: \"I don't always win that battle, but I've gotten to this point. So I guess I didn't lose a lot of battles.\"",
      "And has he practised today?",
      "\"No. I didn't today. And I probably won't.\"",
      "Once again he laughs, and with that he departs, ready for the rest of the day and to watch some more YouTube.",
      "Herbie Hancock will be presented with the Polar Music Prize  in Stockholm, Sweden on 27 May 2025."

    "summary": "The BBC said there had been a significant change in audience behaviour away from long-running shows.",
    "story": [
      "BBC Scotland is to scrap its flagship soap River City after more than 20 years.",
      "The drama which began in September 2002 will continue filming for another 12 months before airing its final series in autumn next year.",
      "The BBC said there had been a significant change in audience behaviour away from long-running series and towards shorter runs.",
      "It said total investment in drama would increase over the next three years with the focus on \"world-class productions\" that can be sold internationally.",
      "River City was set in the fictional west of Scotland area of Shieldinch and filmed on a specially-built set in Dumbarton.",
      "It was originally seen as a Scottish competitor to Eastenders and Coronation Street but was never shown on a UK-wide network.",
      "Stephen Purdon, who was nicknamed Shellsuit Bob in the early years of the show, is the only original member of the cast who still appears in the soap.",
      "In its early days, the soap attracted stars such as Stefan Dennis, from Neighbours, and Lorraine McIntosh from pop band Deacon Blue.",
      "Simon Webbe from pop band Blue also had a part in the show as well as young Sam Heughan, the actor who would go on to star in hit show Outlander.",
      "Singer Susan Boyle, broadcaster Lorraine Kelly and Radio 2 DJ Scott Mills are among the celebrities to have made cameo appearances over the years.",
      "BBC Scotland director Hayley Valentine said: \"The team have done a brilliant job and I know they have some big plans for the finale next year.",
      "\"But as viewing patterns change and competition intensifies, this is the right time to invest in the next generation of high-impact drama series from across Scotland showcasing storytelling across the UK.\"",
      "At the same time as announcing the end of River City, the BBC said three new dramas - Counsels, Grams and The Young Team - would create new opportunities across the independent TV production sector.",
      "It said total investment in BBC drama from Scotland over the next three years is expected to rise to over \u00a395m in total.",
      "As well as the new dramas, the BBC said that popular show Granite Harbour will return for a third series as well as Shetland coming back for its 10th series and Vigil for a third.",
      "Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union, which represents TV crew, said the news was \"incredibly disheartening\".",
      "\"The loss of such a long-running production is devastating for the workers impacted and for the local industry,\" she said.",
      "\"As viewing habits change, broadcasters rightly have to make tough decisions, but it's imperative that the impact on the workforce and the diversity of the industry is accounted for,\" Ms Childs added.",
      "The BBC says the decision to bring River City to an end is driven by changing tastes.",
      "Audiences for soap operas and continuing dramas have been declining across the board.",
      "The focus is shifting towards shorter series which make a high impact.",
      "Shows such as Shetland can be \"appointment to view\" TV which are sold abroad, streamed for a long time and repeated on smaller channels.",
      "The falling audiences for soaps - along with the inflationary costs which have faced drama productions - have led to some hard decisions for commissioners, with daytime soap Doctors and the medical drama Holby City coming to an end.",
      "The challenge for the BBC will be to demonstrate that the resources freed up by this move are being spent effectively on other Scottish dramas.",
      "When the programme started in 2002, the hope was that River City would build a strong relationship with its audience  - especially those viewers who may not have felt well-served by the BBC in general.",
      "It is only natural some regular viewers and fans will be disappointed by today's decision.",
      "But there is also the question of the impact on employment - for actors, writers and production staff.",
      "Many of those who work on River City are freelancers.",
      "It will be vital for the BBC to demonstrate that other commissions balance out River City's loss and ensure there are still plenty of employment opportunities.",
      "It is likely to face scrutiny to ensure a creative decision which will disappoint some viewers does not prove to be bad news for the TV production industry."

    "summary": "The theft of an oil sketch from a stately home in Northamptonshire remained a riddle for 70 years.",
    "story": [
      "An Exeter University art historian has solved the 70-year mystery over the theft of an original oil sketch, by Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, from a stately home in Northamptonshire.",
      "The Portrait of Wolfgang Wilhelm of Pfalz-Neuburg was stolen in 1951 from Boughton House, the home of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry.",
      "It was part of a collection - described as \"a puzzle missing a central piece\" - of 17th Century oil sketches that had been housed at the property since 1682.",
      "But the artwork's disappearance was only noted in 1957, when Mary Montagu Douglas Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry, visited one of Harvard University's galleries - and saw it on display.",
      "Now, thanks to an investigation by Dr Meredith Hale, senior lecturer in Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Exeter, the riddle of how the sketch made its way to the US via prominent members of the art world - including Christie's auction house in London - has been solved.",
      "Dr Hale noted how through \"new archival research in the UK, US and Canada\" she was able to \"reconstruct the painting's movements over three generations\".",
      "She said it \"passed through the hands of experts, conservators, auctioneers, dealers, and collectors from London to Toronto\".",
      "\"Not only do these sources reveal a dynamic picture of events as they unfold,\" she added, \"but they highlight the factors that contributed to the success of the theft, foremost among them the conceptual and material complexity of Van Dyck's iconography project - and the audacity of a thief cloaked in the respectability of expertise.\"",
      "The artwork has now been returned and the story of its journey has been chronicled in a new paper in the British Art Journal.",
      "Money for new curtains",
      "The thief, Dr Hale said, was Leonard Gerald Gwynne Ramsey, the editor of the journal The Connoisseur, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.",
      "Ramsey visited Boughton in July 1951 with a photographer in order to gather material for a piece for the journal's year book.",
      "Among the objects housed at the property for safekeeping during the war were the 37 wooden panels from Van Dyck's unfinished iconography project.",
      "Each panel featured an oil-painted sketch of a prominent prince, scholar, military leader or artist, and would have been used to create prints for sale.",
      "Correspondence between Ramsey and art historian Ludwig Goldscheider revealed that the former intended to sell two paintings because he needed the money to buy new curtains.",
      "According to the research, Goldscheider supplied a certificate of authentication and the picture was sold anonymously at Christie's for \u00a3189 in April 1954.",
      "Dr Hale traced the sale of the picture, less than a year later, to an art dealer in New York, before it moved on to a second dealer who sold it for $2,700 to Dr Lillian Malcove; who in turn donated it to the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University.",
      "In her paper, Dr Hale chronicles terse correspondences between the museum's art director, Professor John Coolidge, and Ramsey once concerns had been raised by the duchess.",
      "Ramsey, it shows, claimed he'd bought the picture from a market in Hemel Hempstead, and he also attempted to cast doubt on the authenticity of the picture.",
      "With doubts growing, the museum returned the picture to Dr Malcove in 1960, and after she died in 1981, it was donated to the Art Museum of the University of Toronto.",
      "Dr Hale said the findings have helped to \"resolve the question of whether this was the picture stolen from Boughton\".",
      "It resulted in the executive committee of the University of Toronto voting to return it to the Duke of Buccleuch, 73 years after it was stolen.",
      "\"Without this painting, the Boughton oil sketches were like a puzzle that's missing a central piece,\" said Dr Hale.",

      "She added: \"Adolescence is a deeply moving, deeply harrowing experience.\"",
      "Peck's review in the Times began: \"Wow. Just wow. I'm tempted to type out the word 'wow' a further 700 times or so, followed by, 'Don't miss Adolescence on Netflix,' and then be done with it.\"",
      "The Telegraph's TV critic Anita Singh said it was \"a devastating watch\", adding: \"It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"",

      "The New York Times' Margaret Lyons called it \"a rich work of social critique\", describing the standout episode, the third, as \"one of the more fascinating hours of TV I've seen in a long time\".",
      "On BBC Radio 5 Live's Must Watch, Hayley Campbell said the drama doesn't attempt to solve the problems it raises.",

      "\"The drama is more about the horror of how little control you have over your kid and what they're doing on their phone.\"",
      "Fellow critic Scott Bryan added: \"The performances are absolutely fantastic. I would say this is flawless. The person, though, I think who deserves the most recognition is 15-year-old Owen Cooper.\""

    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",
      "In December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".",
      "\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.",
      "\"But it does depend on the movie.\"",
      "Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.",
      "Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.",
      "\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.",
      "\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.",

      "Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.",
      "Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.",
      "The story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself.",
      "An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.",
      "The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.",
      "The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".",
      "She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".",
      "The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.",
      "\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.",
      "Heckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".",
      "\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.",
      "Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\".",
      "Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\".",
      "But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".",
      "For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience.",
      "\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"",
      "Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".",
      "Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor.",
      "\"The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,\" he says.",
      "Nostalgia fest",
      "The show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman.",
      "While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems.",
      "The Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.",
      "\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.",
      "For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters.",
      "Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.",
      "\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.",

      "However,  Versace \"never set a fashion agenda\" under Donatella as it had under her brother, Armstrong added - but her \"nose for a story could nevertheless produce fashion magic\".",
      "Her magic moments included dressing Jennifer Lopez in the green jungle dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards, generating so much interest that Google created its image search function.",
      "As former Miu Miu design director Dario Vitale takes over, Donatella will now become an ambassador for the Versace brand.",
      "The big question is what that means for both the company and Donatella herself, who has poured her life into the company, dealing with grief, drug addiction and divorce along the way?",
      "Speculation is growing over whether the company will be sold to the Prada Group by its current owner Capri Holdings.",
      "Capri paid \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.67bn) for the fashion house in 2018 and owns other companies such as Michael Kors.",
      "Prada has been credited with developing a strong vision in recent years, which has translated to healthy sales during a climate of slowdown in the fashion economy.",
      "Imran Amed, CEO of The Business of Fashion, told the BBC World Service that \"Versace is one of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry\" and has \"a very clear design and brand DNA\".",
      "He believes it \"would be a mistake to dilute\" the company or merge it with another, so hopes that if Versace is bought, the vision is to grow it into something bigger.",
      "Amed said Versace makes about $1bn (\u00a3772m) a year, while rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci make $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) and $8bn (\u00a36.2bn) respectively.",
      "Some have touted that Versace's failure to expand into the beauty industry and other affordable luxuries is why it has been left behind financially by its rivals.",
      "Luisa Zargani, Milan bureau chief for Women's Wear Daily, said Donatella had probably stepped back because she knows a \"moment of creative upheaval\" is coming for the brand.",
      "\"There has been a lot of talk about the future of Versace and for the last few years she has been very involved with all her charity work, so she will continue to do [that] while continuing to be part of the Versace family,\" she told BBC News.",
      "Zargani said Donatella \"has always championed young designers\" such as Christopher Kane, Jonathan Anderson and Anthony Vaccarello, and she expects her to continue to be involved as Vitale moves from Miu Miu.",
      "\"[Vitale] is a very solid designer, he's very steady, very creative and has been key in building Miu Miu, so I'm sure she has had her input in this,\" Zargani added.",
      "Friedman said Donatella had probably been thinking about her succession plan \"for a while\".",
      "\"There's a lot of turmoil in the luxury industry at large, and she may have decided it was time for a change,\" she told the World Service's Newshour.",
      "Friedman called her replacement \"a very talented designer\", adding: \"He's been working behind the scenes at Miu Miu for two years and it has been the single hottest brand in fashion over that time period.\"",
      "Vitale has helped steer the brand to record profits, which she said was \"mind boggling\" when \"every other brand in the fashion world has declined during that period\".",
      "Versace herself can be proud of how she has successfully transformed from her brother's muse to a fashion powerhouse, Friedman added.",
      "\"She wasn't the person toiling away with pattern-making back in the atelier, but she really did prove herself, and more credit to her.\"",
      "Donatella's final show earlier this month was staged in a tram station in northern Milan, drawing some of the world's biggest celebrities - once again showcasing how her star power has helped keep the brand a talking point in the fashion world.",
      "Friedman said the show, which featured the brand's signature bold aesthetic, \"reflected the fuzziness around the fate of Versace\" by lacking any clear direction.",
      "Her exit was not announced at the show, but many speculated it was coming because the collection featured references to her late brother's final designs from autumn/winter 1997.",
      "Everyone is now talking about what Donatella does next.",
      "A book or documentary about her would undoubtedly be well received. She is also an advocate for several women's and LGBTQ charities, so could increase her input into those in the future. But she will continue to cast a shadow over the catwalk."

      "\"He goes to the West Indies because he's not somebody who has many prospects in Wales or in England,\" said Prof Evans.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:51:56 GMT",
    "summary": "As part of Your Voice, Your BBC, we answer questions from you on government plans to scrap NHS England.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",
      "\"At times, some weeks, almost 20 new instructions, commissions coming from government and ministers into the system,\" he said.",
      "Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",
      "As Mr Meddings was setting out the case for the defence, the debate about the shake-up rages on.",
      "One well-placed source argued that NHS England's leaders had the chance just after the election to re-set the relationship with government but failed to do so as \"there had been too much suspicion of politicians\".",
      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",
      "But one NHS source noted that the government claimed credit for the fall in the overall waiting list for planned treatment since the election and a two million year-on-year increase in the number of appointments and operations \u2013 performance delivered on NHS England's watch.",
      "The same source pointed out that \"with decrepit hospital buildings a new leadership structure won't make it any easier to carry out operations and care for patients\".",
      "These are huge structural changes for the leadership of the NHS and health administration in England. But they will take time to implement.",
      "Moving two large organisations into one and implementing 9,000 redundancies will take up a lot of management time and there are warnings of possible distraction from the day to day running of services. Patients won't see much difference for a while yet.",

    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

      "Sir Laurie said in his report that he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\".",

      "It says claims that a \u00a3700,000 flat in London King's Cross gifted to Siddiq in 2004 was \"in some way the fruits of embezzlement\" were \"absurd\" and \"cannot be true\" because it was 10 years before the nuclear deal.",
      "In his investigation into the allegations, Sir Laurie Magnus said that \"over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\".",
      "She \"remained under the impression that her parents had bought the property for her\", Sir Laurie added, but had to correct the record when she became a government minister.",
      "He describes this as an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which meant the public had been \"inadvertently misled about the identity of the donor of this gift\".",
      "In their letter to the ACC, Siddiq's lawyers confirm that the King's Cross flat was given to her by Abdul Motalif, who is described as \"an Iman and a very close family friend, akin to Ms Siddiq's godfather\".",
      "The letter also contains a detailed rebuttal of allegations made by the ACC to the media that Siddiq was involved in the appropriation of land in Dhaka.",
      "It describes ACC briefings to the media as an \"unacceptable attempt to interfere with UK politics\".",
      "\"At no point have any allegations been put to her fairly, properly and transparently, or indeed at all, by the ACC or anyone else with proper authority on behalf of the Bangladeshi government, \" the letter says.",
      "\"We require that you immediately stop manufacturing false and vexatious allegations against Ms Siddiq and further media briefings and public comments designed to harm her reputation.\"",

      "The ACC has responded to Siddiq's lawyers in a letter to them claiming that she had \"spent most of her adult life residing in homes owned by cronies of the notoriously venal Awami League\" and that this was evidence she had benefitted from the party's corruption.",
      "The MP's \"claims to have been unaware of the nature of the Hasina regime\" strained credulity, the spokesman added, and the ACC would be in touch with her lawyers \"in due course\".",

      "Sweeping changes were unveiled on Tuesday, which ministers say are aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year and encouraging people to work, while protecting those who cannot.",
      "The government's reforms have faced criticism from Labour backbenchers, unions and charities, who fear the changes could push more disabled people into poverty.",
      "But the bill for health and disability benefits is still set to rise, and Conservatives argue ministers have not gone far enough to cut spending.",
      "When asked if the government would need to make further cuts to welfare in the future, Work and Pensions minister Sir Stephen Timms said the reforms outlined on Tuesday would amount to a \"substantial saving\".",
      "\"We do think we've now made the system sustainable and we're committed to maintaining it,\" Sir Stephen said.",
      "But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour's welfare changes were a \"rushed\" attempt to find savings and shore up the government's finances ahead of the Spring Statement next week.",
      "Stride said it was possible \"to make serious savings in welfare\" and insisted his party's plan to cut spending on health-related benefits by \u00a312bn was achievable.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people are likely to be affected by the benefit changes, which will make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments.",
      "Central to the government's reforms is a tightening of eligibility criteria for the personal independence payment (Pip) - a benefit aimed at helping those with increased living costs due to disability or long-term illness.",
      "More than one million people could lose out on this payment under the changes, the Resolution Foundation think tank has estimated.",
      "Its chief executive, Ruth Curtice, told the BBC the government had \"made quite a detailed change to the system\", meaning \"we can't tell exactly who will be affected\".",
      "Writing in the Times newspaper, Sir Keir said the current system had \"wreaked a terrible human cost\", with people who wanted to return to work unable to access the support they needed.",

      "\"This is not about morality, this is about the Treasury's wish to balance the country's books on the back of the most vulnerable and poor people in this society,\" she said.",
      "Sir Keir told her it was a \"moral issue\" that one in eight young people were not in employment, education or training.",

      "David Lammy has said he \"could have been clearer\" in his comments about Israel blocking aid to Gaza and if the action broke international law.",
      "Answering questions in the Commons on Monday, Lammy twice stated Israel's 16-day blockade preventing humanitarian supplies into Gaza was a \"breach\" of international law.",
      "This led to the prime minister's official spokesperson reconfirming that the government's position is Israel was \"at risk\" of breaching humanitarian law.",
      "Lammy told Bloomberg it was a \"matter for the court\" to decide if international law had been broken.",
      "Why has Israel bombed Gaza and what next for ceasefire deal?",

      "Asked if he regretted his statement, Lammy said it was \"difficult to see how denying humanitarian assistance to a civilian population can be compatible with international humanitarian law\".",

      "Since 2 March, Israel has stopped all food, fuel and medicine entering Gaza in an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions.",
      "Asked about the aid blockade by Labour MP Dr Rupa Huq, Lammy said on Monday: \"This is a breach of international law. Israel quite rightly must defend its own security. But we find the lack of aid \u2013 it's now been 15 days since aid got into Gaza -unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying.",
      "\"We urge Israel to get back to the number of trucks we were seeing going in - way beyond 600 - so that Palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support they need at this time.\"",
      "Lammy told MPs he was \"a little jetlagged\" having returned to the UK from a G7 meeting in the US only hours before his Commons appearance.",

      "Asked about Monday's comments that appeared to go further, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: \"Our position remains that Israel's actions in Gaza are at clear risk of breaching international humanitarian law, and we continue to call the government of Israel to abide by its international obligations.\"",
      "They added: \"The government is not an international court, and, therefore, it is up to courts to make judgments.\"",
      "Asked whether the foreign secretary had mistakenly gone beyond official government policy, the spokesperson said: \"I'd refer to the Foreign Office on that, but there's no change in policy here.\"",
      "Asked whether Lammy should apologise, they added: \"I'll leave that to the Foreign Office.\"",

      "The UK is legally committed to reaching net zero by 2050 under a law passed by former Tory Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.",

      "But UK energy bills went up in January, and are expected to rise again in April.",

    "story": [
      "Under-22s with long-term illnesses or disabilities will no longer be able to claim a health top-up on universal credit under government plans.",
      "It was one of the measures announced by Work Secretary Liz Kendall in a shake-up of the benefits system she said would cut UK's growing welfare bill.",
      "Some 66,000 18 to 21-year-olds are currently claiming the benefit and the money saved by stopping it will be reinvested into training for young people, the government has said.",
      "Kendall said the reforms will mean \"fairness\" for long-term sick and disabled people, but disability campaigners have called them \"dangerous cuts\".",
      "Under the current system, those over the age of 18 but under state pension age in England, Wales, and Scotland can get incapacity benefits on top of universal credit if the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) assesses them as too sick to work.",
      "However, in a paper published by DWP on Tuesday, it proposed raising this age to 22.",
      "The paper also proposed raising the age at which people can claim the adult disability benefit, known as the personal independence payment (Pip), up from 18.",
      "The government is looking for feedback on the proposals alongside other suggested reforms in the white paper before the end of June.",
      "None of the reforms would automatically affect Northern Ireland where responsibility for benefits is devolved. However in practice the Stormont government usually follows benefit changes introduced in England and Wales.",
      "'Trapped out of work'",
      "The reforms come as part of a wider push by Labour to cut spending by reducing the number of people on incapacity benefits, which is forecast to reach a record high by the end of the decade.",
      "Experts say the increase is due to a combination of worse mental health since the pandemic and a higher retirement age meaning some are instead claiming incapacity benefits.",
      "Starmer said he is \"not prepared to stand back and do nothing while millions of people \u2013 especially young people \u2013 who have potential to work and live independent lives, instead become trapped out of work and abandoned by the system\".",
      "However, Disability Rights UK said that barring under-22s from claiming the health element of universal credit alongside the proposal to increase assessments \"mark dangerous cuts for all disabled people\".",
      "The charity added that the package of reforms was \"not about supporting disabled people into work, but making brutal and reckless cuts\".",

      "It takes the party's total number of council seats to more than 100.",
      "Speaking at a press conference in Westminster, Farage said the defections demonstrated how his party was \"broadening and deepening\".",
      "However, it comes as some Reform members are expressing concern about the party's leadership and the suspension of MP Rupert Lowe from the party.",
      "On Sunday, Maria Bowtell, a councillor on East Riding of Yorkshire Council, quit the party. She accused the leadership of \"a lack of integrity and resolve\" and said the treatment of Lowe had been \"the final straw\".",
      "Farage acknowledged that his party had experienced a \"little bit of turbulence\" over the past few weeks.",
      "He said the suspension of Lowe had caused \"consternation\" adding: \"Any argument that's seen to happen within the family does, but I can promise you that in terms of our progress and our planning, that upset is very much at the edges.\"",

      "The party also said it had received allegations of bullying in Lowe's parliamentary and constituency office.",
      "Lowe has said the party's allegations are \"untrue and false\". He argued he had been suspended for criticising Farage in a newspaper interview.",
      "Addressing the row, Farage said: \"We've been increasingly concerned about the behaviour of one of our members of Parliament, and when we found out that some serious complaints have gone in, we thought, you know what, let's just suspend the whip and let's find out what the truth is, and we will wait.\"",
      "He said the report they had commissioned into to the allegations could be completed this week.",
      "Farage also criticised \"the online abuse and frankly outright racism\" directed at Yusuf in recent weeks.",
      "He said the public spat with Lowe would not \"put a dent\" in Reform UK's electoral chances, as the party gears up for local elections on 1 May.",
      "\"We're going to be out there canvassing, campaigning, and doing our best to prove that the polls aren't virtual, actually, the real votes exist out there on the ground.\"",
      "The party has said it plans to stand in all the council seats that are due to hold elections in May.",
      "Of Reform UK's 113 councillor seats, 15 have been won through elections, including seven from Labour and four from the Conservatives.",
      "The remaining 98 seats have turned Reform UK through defections - 62 of those defections have happened since the beginning of the year.",
      "The majority of the defections (66) were originally elected as Conservative councillors. Three came from Labour and one came from the Liberal Democrats.",
      "The rest were independent councillors or came from local parties.",
      "Farage has previously spoken about his aim to \"professionalise\" Reform UK and the importance of vetting the party's candidates.",
      "Following Monday's press conference, Farage was questioned about reports that in 2022 his party's head of vetting Jack Aaron had said Adolf Hitler was \"brilliant\" at inspiring \"people into action\".",
      "Asked if Reform UK would be investigating the comments, Farage said: \"No, don't be ridiculous.",
      "\"This is an orthodox Jew who said Hitler was evil but he acknowledged he was very good at getting a crowd.\"",
      "Questioned about his comments by the Times last year, Aaron said: \"Yes, Hitler was as brilliant as he was utter evil. How is that controversial to say, given that he was able to turn the Germans to such destructive acts, including killing many members of my own family?\"",

      "Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Ms Spielman claims \"effective reforms are being reversed\" - referring to potential changes to academy schools' powers.",
      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is set to change the rules around how academies pay their staff and the material they can teach, which critics say threatens their autonomy.",
      "But the Department for Education (DfE) says its \"landmark\" reforms deliver on its mission to ensure all schools can attract and retain the best teachers.",
      "In a piece covering academies, qualifications, the curriculum and Ofsted itself, the ex-chief of the organisation says the education secretary should reconsider the reforms in the bill \"before the damage is done\".",
      "Ms Spielman stepped down as head of Ofsted at the end of 2023.",
      "An inquiry into Ofsted was launched that year, after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, who died by suicide following an Ofsted inspection.",
      "Ms Spielman accuses the education secretary of using \"polished verbiage and jazz hands\" when announcing policies, and claimed some policies had been \"influenced by education union leaders and activists\".",

      "But Ms Spielman claimed the changes to Ofsted were being done \"to please unions\", by making it \"much less likely that inspection will detect weaknesses or convey a negative message.\"",
      "Speaking to Radio 4's World at One programme, Ms Spielman said she thought it was \"surprising\" that education unions were approached for comments on stories about Ofsted.",
      "A government source's comment, which said Ms Spielman should \"spend less time criticising the reforms this government is bringing, and more time reflecting on her failure at Ofsted\", was also put to the ex-Ofsted boss during the interview.",
      "She responded by saying it was \"fascinating because that's a union line\", reiterating her criticism of the organisations which she says have been \"attacking accountability and attacking inspection from long before I became chief inspector\".",
      "In The Telegraph piece, the ex-Ofsted head also says the government's proposals for academies will \"cut the autonomy of schools and school groups right back\".",
      "She says she is \"astonished by the speed and thoroughness with which Bridget Phillipson has moved to dismantle every main pillar of the system\".",
      "The schools bill, due to go before MPs again on Monday, includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.",
      "Several issues covered by the bill, including safeguarding, have been met positively by school leaders.",
      "More controversial and debated elements have been around academy reforms, which may limit academies' powers to manage their pay and working practices differently to schools run by local authorities.",
      "After facing opposition from academy leaders, the government has since clarified that it intends the pay framework to be a \"floor not a ceiling\", meaning academy bosses will still be able to pay teachers more if they choose to.",
      "Phillipson previously called political attempts to halt the bill \"utterly sickening\", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme the children's bill was \"the single biggest piece of children safeguarding legislation in a generation\".",
      "Responding to Ms Spielman's claims, a DfE spokesperson said the bill, alongside other reforms, \"delivers on our mission for every child to have a good, local school, will get high-quality teachers into every classroom, and ensure that all schools can innovate to attract and retain the best talent\".",

    "story": [
      "The chancellor has told regulators there is \"too much bureaucracy\" as she aims to slash red tape to boost economic growth.",

      "It comes as a leading think tank cut its UK growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as it downgraded prospects for the global economy over trade war concerns.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\".",
      "Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\".",
      "\"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said.",

      "'Global headwinds'",
      "In its latest forecast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4% in 2025, from its previous forecast of 1.7%, and to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1.3%.",
      "However, the forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of England, which earlier this month cut its UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.75%.",

      "The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\"",
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\"",
      "Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion.",
      "Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed.",
      "This plan comes alongside 60 measures agreed upon by watchdogs \"following weeks of intense negotiations\" that are designed to make it easier to do business in the UK.",
      "Those measures include:",

      "On Thursday, the Sentencing Council - which is independent but sponsored by the government - said it would look at her objections in detail, but did not commit to reversing course immediately.",
      "Mahmood had criticised the guidelines and said she would not tolerate \"differential treatment before the law\".",

      "The sentencing council agreed to \"consider\" the letter \"before the guideline is due to come into effect\" from April.",
      "The reforms were strongly criticised by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick when they were published last week. He told the Commons they would disadvantage white offenders.",
      "Mahmood said she would pass a new law to overrule the council if necessary, triggering a stand-off between the Ministry of Justice and the organisation it tasks with advising judges.",
      "Initially the Sentencing Council pushed back against complaints from Mahmood and the Conservatives, and said ministers from both main parties had known about its plans for new guidance for judges since 2022.",
      "In a six-page response to Mahmood issued earlier this week, the Sentencing Council chair said the government could not \"dictate\" sentencing guidelines.",
      "Lord Justice Davis said the new guidance aimed to correct disparities which lead to people from ethnic minorities receiving longer sentences on average than white offenders.",

      "The payments will go up in line with inflation this year.",
      "But the eligibility criteria will be tightened up from November 2026, potentially resulting in reduced payments for many.",
      "It will become harder to qualify for the daily living component of Pip, which starts at \u00a372.65 a week. There will be no change to the mobility component.",

      "The work capability assessment that determines who is eligible for incapacity benefits will be scrapped in 2028, under the proposals.",
      "Instead, people applying for health-related financial support and disability benefits will only face one assessment, based on the current Pip system.",
      "Incapacity benefits under universal credit to be halved for new claimants",
      "Incapacity benefits under universal credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at \u00a397 per week from April next year - this means they will not be increased in line with inflation until 2029/30.",
      "The amount will be reduced to \u00a350 per week in 2026/2027 for new claimants.",
      "But those receiving the new reduced universal credit health element after April 2026, who have the most severe, life-long health conditions, who have no prospect of improvement and will never be able to work, will see their incomes protected through an additional premium.",
      "It also means those in that group will not be reassessed in the future.",
      "There will also be an above inflation increase in the standard rate of universal credit for all those seeking work, adding up to \u00a3775 a year extra by 2029/30.",

      "Reduced incapacity benefits for under 22s",
      "Those aged under 22 will no longer be able to claim the incapacity benefit top-up to universal credit under these proposals.",
      "The government says any savings generated from the delay would be reinvested into work support and training opportunities for this age group.",
      "Ministers are also consulting on raising the age at which young people move from Disability Living Allowance for children to Pip from 16 to 18.",
      "The idea is that young people will have work and training \"rather than a pathway to economic inactivity\", the DWP says.",
      "More incentives to work",
      "The government says it wants to ease people's fears about losing benefits if they take a job and it doesn't work out.",
      "Ministers say they will introduce legislation \"as soon as possible\" to guarantee that trying work will not lead to an automatic Pip or work capability reassessment.",
      "It's hoped a newly-designed \"support conversation\" will give people who have a health condition or disability help to access work.",

      "The basic level of universal credit for those seeking work will rise, but people under 22 will no longer be able to claim incapacity benefit.",
      "What is Pip and how are the rules changing?",
      "Pip is paid to more than 3.6 million people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition.",
      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",

      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025 to \u00a350 a week by next year.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will be frozen until 2029-2030.",
      "However, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise, reaching a \u00a3775 annual increase by the year 2029-30.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",

      "Pip is now the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending expected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",

    "summary": "Labour may have ditched its factional in-fighting - but deep welfare cuts could reignite tensions.",
    "story": [
      "The prime minister has just had another moment at the lectern, urging Europe to stand up for Ukraine. He's an increasingly confident leader, but in the coming days No 10 faces what could be a defining fight at home.",
      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",
      "A long-time party observer says: \"Put three Labour people in a room and you'll have a faction.\"",
      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",
      "One of those arguing against them told me the vast majority of Labour MPs were in the \"group of resistance\" \u2013 and \"privately some of the cabinet are very against it.\"",
      "There is a whiff of opportunity to force Sir Keir to back down, some believe. \"There is a chance that the old left and the soft left come together,\" another MP tells me.",
      "A source on the left of the party tells me there's \"potential to broaden this out and team up with people who don't want to see benefits cut after 15 years of austerity. The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health and disability benefits.",
      "The bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting those who can work back into employment.",
      "The plans include cutting the level of some benefits and tightening eligibility for others, along with investment to help people into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget.",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
      "What are the Pip and universal credit changes and who is affected?",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "The government hopes to curb the rise in the overall bill by holding some of the benefits of existing incapacity claimants flat in cash terms - rather than allowing them to rise in line with inflation - until 2030.",
      "It also plans to reduce the benefits of many new claimants outright relative to current levels.",
      "This echoes the policies of previous governments.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits were increased below the rate of inflation to save money.",
      "This included a portion of the payments received by people on incapacity benefit.",
      "However, despite these real terms cuts in many benefits, from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "The Government is also planning to keep a lid on the overall working-age benefit bill by making it harder for people to claim some disability benefits, notably PIP.",
      "This too echoes the policies of previous administrations.",
      "For instance, Rishi Sunak's government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015, and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria.",
      "Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to slash the costs of regulation with an \"active government\".",
      "In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos and he took aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\".",
      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",
      "He announced the government was bringing it back under the control of the Department of Health.",
      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",
      "Why are they controversial?",
      "Campaign groups like the TaxPayers' Alliance have long criticised quangos, claiming they allow ministers to dodge responsibility for mistakes and can be inefficient and costly.",
      "The Institute for Government think tank says in some cases scrapping public bodies can save money and improve how services are delivered.",
      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",
      "But the think tank argues abolitions also cost money and time in the short term, with services disrupted when powers are transferred.",

    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are expected on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The government is also seeking to reorganise the civil service to reduce bureaucracy. It has already announced that NHS England will be scrapped, and other quangos and regulators are also expected to be axed.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",

      "Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish, with the Office for National Statistics describing the situation as one of \"weak growth\".",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "Neither are the first to grumble about the machinery of government.",
      "More than 20 years ago, Sir Tony Blair gave a speech much of which Sir Keir could give today.",
      "\"Sometimes we can be so frightened of the process of accountability, we opt for inertia,\" Sir Tony said in 2004, adding that too often the civil service had acted as \"a shock absorber in order to maintain the status quo\".",

      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",

      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",

      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",

      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally on their way home.",
      "Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems.",
      "The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .",
      "Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.",
      "It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.",
      "The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.",
      "As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.",
      "Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.",
      "Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.",
      "\"They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,\" she told BBC News.",
      "How did Nasa's Suni and Butch fill nine months in space?",
      "Stranded astronauts heading back to Earth after nine months in space",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.",
      "The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.",
      "They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.",
      "\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,\" he said.",
      "Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.",
      "\"I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.\"",
      "The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.",
      "But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.",
      "Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.",
      "\"It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2026. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.\"",
      "Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",
      "Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.",
      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.",
      "Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space.",
      "\"I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss.\""

    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",

      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",

      "Their final insurance bill was around \u00a345,000.",
      "She says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk.",
      "Although she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. \"We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm.",
      "\"We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn't much detail other than flood zone maps.\"",
      "Climate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes.",
      "While it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk.",
      "Last December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future\u202fflood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England.",
      "It used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office.",
      "It also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively.",
      "The new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050.",
      "\"We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,\" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency.",
      "\"When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century.\"",
      "The Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk.",
      "Similar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI.",
      "\"We can no longer rely on historical data,\" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X.",

      "It combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models.",
      "\"While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,\" he says.",
      "\"Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be.\"",
      "While banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments.",
      "\"They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,\" says Mr Ahmed.",
      "Many parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK.",
      "In the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida.",

      "\"We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,\" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes.",
      "\"We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,\" he adds.",
      "Faura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports.",
      "\"Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,\" says Mr Holmes.",
      "Other services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property.",
      "\"If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],\" says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather.",
      "As for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group.",
      "\"Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,\" she advises.",
      "\"Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health. You are supposed to feel safe in your home, it shouldn't be a place of worry and anxiety.\""

      "In a social media video he said he filmed while police were outside his home, he vowed to \"stand resolute\" for the people of Turkey \"and all who uphold democracy and justice worldwide\".",
      "And in a handwritten note posted on his X account after his arrest, he said the people of Turkey would respond to \"the lies, the conspiracies and the traps\" against him.",
      "Protests have erupted on Turkey's streets and university campuses, and in underground stations, with crowds chanting anti-government slogans. It is a display of public anger not seen in years.",
      "There were reports of clashes between protesters and police in Turkey's largest city. Reuters news agency footage shows police using pepper spray pellets to disperse crowds outside Istanbul University.",
      "The government has banned public gatherings in Istanbul as part of the four days of restrictions. But more protests are anticipated nationwide as opposition leaders, including Imamoglu's wife, urge people to \"raise their voices\".",

      "Imamoglu's party, the CHP, even condemned the arrests as \"a coup against our next president\", a sentiment widely echoed by pro-opposition voices.",
      "But Turkey's justice minister criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests.",

      "The CHP's presidential candidate selection, in which Imamoglu is the only person running, is set to take place on Sunday.",

      "According to the Turkish constitution, presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.",
      "Imamoglu called that move \"legally baseless\", adding that universities \"must remain independent, free from political interference and dedicated to knowledge\".",
      "Presidential elections are currently scheduled for 2028. Erdogan cannot currently run for office again, as he is in his second term and previously served as prime minister before that.",
      "The only way Erdogan could contest another election would be to change the constitution, or call an early election before his term ends.",
      "As well as being accused of extortion and fraud, Imamoglu is also alleged to have aided the PKK.",
      "The PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - has waged an insurgency since 1984, and is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.",
      "Earlier this month the group announced its decision to lay down arms, following a call from its imprisoned leader, who had engaged in talks with Turkish officials.",
      "International reaction to the arrest has been negative. Germany's foreign ministry said it was part of \"intensified legal measures\" designed to put pressure on Imamoglu, while France said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the arrests, which could have \"heavy consequences on Turkish democracy\".",
      "The Turkish lira, meanwhile, briefly crashed to an all-time low against the US dollar, as markets reacted poorly to the political uncertainty.",
      "While many were shocked to wake up to the news of Imamoglu's arrest, legal pressure on the popular opposition leader is far from new.",
      "He has faced multiple investigations and was handed a political ban in December 2022 over allegations of insulting Turkey's electoral board in 2019 - a verdict he appealed, with the final ruling still pending.",
      "Additionally, he has been the subject of cases related to alleged tender irregularities during his tenure as mayor of Istanbul's Beylikduzu district.",
      "More recently, on 20 January, a new case was filed against him over his criticism of a prosecutor."

    "story": [
      "The Malaysian cabinet has approved a fresh search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, more than a decade after the aircraft vanished.",
      "The search will cover a 15,000 sq km area in the southern Indian Ocean, under a \"no find, no fee\" agreement with the exploration firm Ocean Infinity.",
      "The company will receive $70m (\u00a356m) if the wreckage is found, transport minister Loke Siew Fook announced.",
      "Flight MH370 disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Its disappearance is one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries, which continues to haunt the families of the passengers.",
      "Despite extensive searches in the years since it vanished, no wreckage has been found. Previous efforts, including a multinational search that cost $150m (\u00a3120m), ended in 2017.",
      "The governments of the three nations involved - Malaysia, Australia and China - said the search would only be resumed \"should credible new evidence emerge\" of the aircraft's location.",
      "A 2018 search for the wreckage by Ocean Infinity under similar terms ended unsuccessfully after three months.",
      "In December, Malaysia's government agreed in principle to resume the search. However, the final negotiations were not completed until March.",
      "Malaysia's final approval on Wednesday will now allow the search to begin.",
      "Loke said in a statement: \"The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers.\"",
      "Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur in the early hours of 8 March 2014. Less than an hour after takeoff, it lost communication with air traffic control, and radar showed that it had deviated from its planned flight path.",
      "Investigators generally agree that the plane crashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, though the reason for the crash remains unclear.",
      "Pieces of debris, believed to be from the plane, have washed up on the shores of the Indian Ocean in the years following its disappearance.",
      "The aircraft's disappearance has given rise to a host of conspiracy theories, including speculation that the pilot had deliberately brought the plane down and claims that it had been shot down by a foreign military.",
      "An investigation in 2018 into the aircraft's disappearance found that the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course, but drew no conclusions behind it.",
      "Investigators said at the time that \"the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found\".",
      "The passengers included people from more than a dozen countries: just under two-thirds were Chinese nationals, followed by 38 Malaysians, with others from Australia, Indonesia, India, France, Ukraine, the US and several other nations.",
      "Family members of missing Chinese MH370 passengers met with officials in Beijing earlier in March to discuss the renewed search for the wreckage and express their hopes for an independent search. Some relatives voiced their frustration over a lack of direct communication from the Malaysian authorities.",
      "\"It was promised that we would be informed immediately [but] we can only find out about this kind of news online,\" said Li Eryou, a 68-year-old father who lost his 29-year-old son.",
      "\"Many families don't even know how to access this information, so they are completely unaware,\" he told AFP.",
      "Grieving families gathered outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on the eleventh anniversary of the flight's disappearance earlier this month, chanting: \"Give us back our loved ones!\"",
      "Cheng Liping, whose husband had been in Malaysia for a film shoot and had been returning to China on MH370, said she hoped Beijing would communicate more with Malaysia to uncover the truth.",
      "\"Everyone has been left trapped in pain,\" she told reporters. \"What exactly happened is still unknown.\"",

      "More shocking claims emerged in the second week.",
      "A local pastor said that as far back as 2023, he had heard Ms Smith - a mother of three - talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100, \u00a3850) each, though she had said she was willing to accept a lower figure of $275.",
      "Joshlin's teacher then alleged in court that Ms Smith had told her during the search that her daughter was already \"on a ship, inside a container, and they were on the way to West Africa\".",
      "These revelations paled in comparison to the explosive details made by Lourentia Lombaard, a friend and neighbour of Ms Smith, who turned state witness.",
      "She took the stand last Thursday and, over three days, detailed the events in the lead up to Joshlin's disappearance that involved a  traditional healer, known in South Africa as a \"sangoma\".",
      "Ms Lombaard alleged that her friend confessed to her: \"I did something silly \u2026 I sold my child to a sangoma\", adding that she had been driven by a desperate need for money.",
      "Joshlin's mother promised those who knew of the plan some money in return for their silence, Ms Lombaard said.",
      "She told the court that she later witnessed Ms Smith pack some clothes for Joshlin into a black bag, which she then saw her carry as the two walked to meet a woman Ms Lombaard believes was the sangoma.",
      "Mother and daughter got into a white car and drove away with the woman, Ms Lombaard said.",
      "Speaking on Monday, her last day on the stand, Ms Lombaard told the court that the \"person who [allegedly took] Joshlin wanted her for her eyes and skin\".",
      "It was not made clear in court why a sangoma would want a child like this.",
      "A woman believed to be a traditional healer was initially arrested and charged alongside Ms Smith and her co-accused last year, but the charges against her were eventually dropped because of a lack of evidence.",
      "Sangomas are legally recognised in South Africa under the Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007, alongside herbalists, traditional birth attendants and traditional surgeons.",
      "It is believed that ancestral spirits are able to provide advice and healing through these culturally respected practitioners.",
      "Some charlatans are involved in unscrupulous traditional so-called cures, and have been known to sell good luck charms that involve body parts.",
      "Ms Lombaard expressed sorrow over her role in Joshlin's disappearance, saying that she had tried, without success, to stop Ms Smith from selling her daughter.",

    "summary": "The files are still being reviewed, but have not so far revealed any smoking gun about the US president's killing.",
    "story": [
      "The US government has released the final batch of documents on the assassination of President John F Kennedy (JFK) - a case that still inspires conspiracy theories more than 60 years later.",
      "It follows an executive order by President Donald Trump that required remaining unredacted files in the case to be made public.",
      "Experts are combing over the papers, not all of which have appeared online. They say the job will take time, and that they do not expect many ground-breaking revelations.",
      "US authorities have previously released hundreds of thousands of JFK documents, but held some back, citing national security concerns. Many Americans still believe the gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not act alone.",
      "Kennedy was shot during a visit to Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963.",
      "Trump said beforehand that 80,000 pages would be unsealed.",
      "Of the 1,123 documents included in Tuesday's release from the National Archives and Records Administration, it was not immediately clear how much material was new. Many documents have previously been released in partially redacted form.",
      "\"You got a lot of reading,\" Trump told reporters on Monday, previewing the release. \"I don't believe we're going to redact anything.\"",
      "But some of the hundreds of files unsealed on Tuesday night did appear to have passages blacked out. Others were hard to read, because they were faded or were poorly scanned photocopies, or appeared to bear little relevance to the JFK case, specialists said.",
      "Non-scholars would probably be \"baffled\", commented David Barrett of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, as he reviewed the released material on Tuesday.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, he said the release was \"useful\", but he was not expecting \"earth-shaking information, either with regard to the assassination or more broadly\".",
      "Other JFK experts suggested the American public might keep wondering about the possible existence of other documents and information.",
      "\"I think there may continue to be more record releases,\" historian Alice George told Reuters. But she went on to say the passage of time made investigations hard: \"It's much harder to find the truth when most of the people involved are dead.\"",

      "A government commission in the aftermath of the killing determined that President Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, a Marine veteran and self-described Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union and later returned to the US.",
      "Opinion polls over decades have indicated that most Americans don't believe Oswald was the sole assassin. But no clear alternative narrative is yet to emerge from the latest batch of unsealed documents.",
      "Unanswered questions have long dogged the case, giving rise to theories about the involvement of government agents, the mafia and other nefarious characters - as well as more outlandish claims.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law to release all documents related to the investigation within 25 years.",
      "Both Trump, in his first term, and President Joe Biden released piles of JFK-related documents - but thousands remained partially or fully secret.",

      "His announcement on Monday that the document release was imminent came as a surprise to his national security team, which had been working since January to prepare the files by removing redactions, according to US media reports.",
      "The Republican president vowed during last year's White House race to release JFK files, shortly after he secured the endorsement of Robert F Kennedy Jr (RFK Jr), the nephew of JFK and son of Robert F Kennedy.",

    "summary": "State newspaper gloated that the network has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".",
    "story": [
      "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.",
      "The decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.",
      "Critics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".",
      "The White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".",
      "Trump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.",
      "They have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.",
      "Although authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.",
      "RFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".",
      "It was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.",
      "VOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.",
      "But China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".",
      "\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.",
      "Hu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"",
      "Such responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by BBC World Service.",
      "\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.",
      "The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".",
      "Founded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.",
      "VOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".",
      "Ms Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.",
      "She rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".",
      "The recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".",
      "She is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.",
      "Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going. It reports in 27 languages from 23 countries, reaching more than 47 million people every week.",
      "RFA chief executive Bay Fang said in a statement that the organisation plans to challenge the order. Cutting funding to these outlets is a \"reward to dictators and despots, including the Chinese Communist Party, who would like nothing better than to have their influence go unchecked in the information space\", he said.",
      "RFA started in 1996 and reaches nearly 60 million people weekly in China, Myanmar, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In China, it also broadcasts in minority languages like Tibetan and Uyghur, apart from English and Mandarin.",
      "\"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.",
      "While Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.",
      "Outside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried.",
      "\"Looking back at history, countless exiles, rebels, intellectuals, and ordinary people have persisted in the darkness because of the voices of VOA and RFA, and have seen hope in fear because of their reports,\" Du Wen, a Chinese dissident living in Belgium, wrote on X.",
      "\"If the free world chooses to remain silent, then the voice of the dictator will become the only echo in the world.\""

      "Mr Dyasi was among about 17,000 people who received a one-off payment of  30,000 rand ($3,900; \u00a32,400 at the time) from it in 2003, but he says that has done very little to help him.",

      "Mr Mphahlele told the BBC that the 30,000 rand pay-out, which he had received for the violations he endured during his 10 years in prison, was an insult.",

    "story": [
      "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.",
      "A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.",
      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",
      "The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.",
      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",
      "Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.",
      "Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.",
      "\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.",
      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.",
      "\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.",
      "\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you\u2026 because there's nothing else \u2013 there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.",
      "Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.",
      "But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.",

      "Trump launched Truth Social in February 2022 after he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden and was temporarily banned from major social networks like Twitter and Facebook, which accused him of inciting violence.",

    "summary": "The King, who is also head of state of Canada, meets the country's new prime minister Mark Carney amid a trade war with the US.",
    "story": [
      "King Charles gave a warm welcome to the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney when he visited Buckingham Palace.",
      "It was another symbolic gesture of support for Canada from a King, wearing a red tie, who has to send coded signals rather than spell things out in words, as Canada faces threats from US President Donald Trump.",
      "But the King has sought to make clear his commitment to Canada - and if it had not been for his cancer diagnosis, the BBC understands he would have travelled there for an intended visit in 2024.",
      "There are also suggestions that once Canada's election is out the way, a visit to Canada will be a priority, where he can further demonstrate his support.",
      "Canada will 'never' be part of US, says Carney in first speech as PM",
      "Canada's Carney makes statement by choosing Europe, not US, for first foreign trip",
      "King's pivotal role in Trump and Ukraine balancing act",
      "The new Canadian prime minister told the King that his Order of Canada pin had broken this morning. The King joked: \"Do you want mine?\"",
      "The King congratulated Carney on becoming the new PM, ushering him to a seat, and perhaps hoping that the broken pin was not a symbol of a Commonwealth relationship under strain.",
      "\"These things are rather important,\" said the King, ahead of a 30-minute conversation with no one else in attendance.",
      "Carney later went on to meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer at Downing Street.",
      "Sir Keir hailed the relationship between the two countries and said they had \"so much in common - shared history, shared values, shared King.\"",
      "Carney said he was \"grateful for the welcomes and the constructive discussions\" with Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron - whom he had met earlier in the day.",
      "At a news conference, he was asked if he felt let down by the lack of public support for Canada from other allies, given Trump's trade war with Canada, and his remarks about making Canada the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"We don't need another country to validate our sovereignty, we are sovereign, we don't need praise from another country, we are proud in and of ourselves,\" he said, adding that Sir Keir had made a point of referring to Canada's sovereignty and to \"our shared sovereign in King Charles III.\"",
      "Symbolic displays",
      "The meeting with Carney is the latest scene in an intricate diplomatic balancing act for a King who is head of state of both the UK and Canada.",
      "King Charles has to show solidarity with Canada without disrupting the UK's relationship with Trump.",
      "The King also has to avoid getting directly involved in politics - and has to speak on advice of ministers. Whatever he might personally believe about Trump's comments about taking over Canada, the King has to keep his thoughts to himself.",
      "Adding to this complicated choreography is that the royals are one of the strongest cards the UK can play with President Trump. He seemed delighted by his second state visit invitation from the King.",
      "So messages from the King are sent in symbolic displays. In case anyone missed the signs over Canada, there have been multiple moments. And then some more.",
      "When the King visited aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, he appeared wearing a set of Canadian medals.",
      "The 60th anniversary of Canada's maple leaf flag might usually have passed without any royal intervention, but there was a fulsome message sent by the King, praising the \"proud, resilient and compassionate country\".",
      "A ceremonial sword for Canada became an event at Buckingham Palace with a formal presentation by the King.",
      "At a tree planting ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the tree chosen was a maple. And when the King sat down at the Commonwealth Service last week, it was on a Canadian chair.",
      "If any of these moments were accidental, they were not being rejected by Buckingham Palace, with royal sources emphasising the King's commitment to Canada.",
      "But there is no avoiding the tensions and contradictions in this balancing act. Emails from Canadians to the BBC's Royal Watch newsletter show that many want a much more robust defence from the King.",
      "\"What a cop out! Throw Canada to the wolves. Giving us back pats for our flag's anniversary doesn't quite cut it. Here sits a monarchist who is seriously rethinking his allegiance to the crown!\" emailed Brian, a Canadian military veteran.",
      "Carol in Vancouver was unhappy at the invitation from the UK for a second state visit by President Trump.",
      "\"I feel ashamed for the Brits feeling they have to follow through with inviting such a boor for dinner.  For the life of me I do not understand why he has this power over you,\" she wrote.",
      "\"As a Canadian, the invitation is a slap in the face to the people of Canada.  If the King is our King (as we are a Commonwealth country), and Trump is basically at war with us, how dare King Charles give him any credence?\" emailed Patricia.",
      "\"As a Canadian I am saddened, appalled, disgusted and angry that King Charles appears to be joining the conga line of supplicants,\" said Jo-Ann in Ontario.",
      "But King Charles will have to keep to the line set by ministers, and if that means maintaining good relations with Trump, he is unlikely to be saying anything more outspoken.",

    "story": [
      "Ekrem Imamoglu, the Turkish presidential hopeful detained on charges including corruption and aiding a terrorist group, is one of the country's most popular politicians.",
      "A leading figure in the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and mayor of Istanbul, the 54-year-old has long been seen as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's most formidable rival.",
      "He stunned Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AK) when he retained control over Istanbul in last year's municipality elections, winning a second successive mandate in Turkey's largest city.",
      "Many political commentators in Turkey have referred to this as \"Erdogan's worst defeat ever\".",
      "But Imamoglu's arrest, which came days before he was due to be selected as a candidate, prompted the CHP to warn of a \"coup attempt against the next president\".",
      "Born in 1970 in Akcaabat, a seaside town in Trabzon province on Turkey's Black Sea coast, Imamoglu moved to Istanbul as a teenager, studied business and then went to work in the construction industry.",
      "Despite his family's centre-right, conservative background, Imamoglu says he \"embraced social democratic values during his time in university\".",
      "A football enthusiast, like Erdogan himself, Imamoglu was also an amateur player in his youth and is well known for his support of his local club, Trabzonspor. A love of the sport is a useful characteristic for a politician in football-mad Turkey.",
      "After a business career, at the age of 43 he turned to politics and was elected mayor of Istanbul's middle-class Beylikduzu district for the CHP.",
      "But he was still relatively little known until he fought and won mayoral elections in Istanbul in 2019, which came as a major shock to Erdogan and the AK.",
      "Imamoglu faced immediate challenges to his victory - the electoral authorities annulled the vote and forced him out of office after the AK alleged irregularities in the voting process. A re-run was ordered.",
      "After the announcement of the re-run, Imamoglu addressed huge crowds of his supporters at a rally, taking his jacket and tie off, rolling up his sleeves and urging them to focus their energy on winning again.",
      "\"Everything will be fine,\" he said, which became his campaign slogan and has been his catchphrase ever since.",
      "And for Imamoglu, \"everything did go fine\" - he secured 54% of the votes in another huge blow to the president.",
      "He had now beaten the AK twice, in a city which the governing party and its Islamist predecessors had run for 25 years.",
      "Istanbul is where Erdogan grew up, selling sesame bread snacks before going into politics in the 1970s. It was here that he rose through the ranks to become mayor, prime minister and ultimately president.",
      "This loss would have stung him personally and hurt his party too. Istanbul is home to a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million and responsible for a significant portion of its economy, including trade, tourism and finance.",
      "Many experts predicted a similar rise to power for Imamoglu after he won a second mandate in 2024. For many, he was becoming a threat to Erdogan's grip on Turkey's top office.",
      "Erdogan secured a third term in presidential elections in 2023 and under the constitution he cannot govern beyond 2028.",
      "But his critics say he might change the constitution in order to seek yet another term. The next poll is scheduled for 2028, but likely to happen earlier.",
      "Broad appeal",
      "During his political campaigns, Imamoglu has been praised for his soft, humorous approach to politics, which contrasts with that of many rivals in Turkey's polarised political landscape.",
      "Broadening the CHP's secular base, he has managed to appeal to some of Turkey's more pious, conservative voters, who had traditionally voted for the AK, by including visits to mosques in his election campaigns and recently announcing the restoration of a historic mosque in Istanbul's popular Karakoy district.",
      "His wife Dilek Imamoglu has also become a popular figure with her active presence on social media, involvement in charity work for the disabled and appearances alongside her husband during his campaign.",
      "The main opposition's primary election was scheduled for 23 March, at which Imamoglu had been expected to be chosen as its candidate for the 2028 presidential vote.",

      "Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his \"war\" against criminal gangs.",
      "He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels.",
      "He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater.",
      "Violence has soared in Ecuador in recent years, with gangs battling to control drug trafficking routes. Most of the world's cocaine is trafficked through Ecuador's ports.",
      "President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels \u2013 but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil and Europe.",
      "Security \u2013 and how he is dealing with it \u2013 is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April.",
      "Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons \u2013 however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed.",
      "During his term, the murder rate decreased by approximately 16% from 2023 to 2024 but it remains far higher than previous years, and in January 2025 killings hit a record 781 in one month.",
      "In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: \"We need to have more soldiers to fight this war.\"",
      "\"Seventy per cent of the world's cocaine exits via Ecuador. We need the help of international forces.\"",
      "He said what started as \"criminal gangs\" are now \"international narco-terrorist\" groups of 14,000 armed individuals.",
      "Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them.",
      "Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: \"I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are.\"",
      "Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with \"allied nations\" to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again.",
      "As well as constitutional changes, it would require other nations to be willing to offer this. Deploying armies abroad can be risky and expensive but there is some precedent for it. The US had a military base for its anti-narcotic operations in Ecuador until 2009, before these were banned by former President Rafael Correa.",
      "President Noboa's challenge will be convincing figures like Donald Trump in the US, or leaders in Europe where many drugs are shipped to, that it is in their interests too to stop cartels and drug trafficking.",
      "On the alliance with Trump ally Erik Prince, which he announced a few days ago, he said: \"We're fighting an unconventional, urban guerilla war. He has the experience. He's advising our armed forces, our police.\"",
      "Mr Prince founded the private military firm Blackwater that has provided security services to US governments but has also been embroiled in controversy. He sold the company in 2010.",
      "Four Blackwater contractors were convicted and jailed for killing 14 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007 and were later pardoned by Trump in 2020.",
      "Does President Noboa want Mr Prince to bring mercenaries to the country?",
      "\"Not necessarily mercenaries,\" he said. \"We are talking about armies. US, European, Brazilian special forces. This could be a great help for us.\"",
      "While some supported the move, some Ecuadoreans cited Mr Prince's past record and feared rights abuses in the country.",
      "When asked about some of Erik Prince's past controversies, Mr Noboa said Ecuador's laws must be respected and warfare conducted legally.",
      "But, he added, cartels had \"violated every single human right possible for the last five years\".",
      "\"They've mutilated people. They've raped thousands of women. They've trafficked human organs. They've traded illegal gold. And moved more than 1,000 tonnes of cocaine a year.\"",
      "Last year, his iron-fist approach came under fire after four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft and later found mutilated and burned.",
      "Noboa said those soldiers were in jail pending an investigation but that he would \"fight until the end\" to convict those responsible.",
      "He maintained the armed forces were acting proportionately in tackling crime and noted an imbalance between his 35,000-strong military and 40,000 armed gang members.",
      "With the record number of killings in January, leading critics argue his strict approach is failing.",
      "During a campaign rally, his left-wing challenger Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez said: \"The campaign promises made in 2023 were to be delivered in a year and a half. Not two. Not three. Did he deliver? No!\"",
      "Noboa said it was normal to see rising violence before elections in his country, but reiterated that Ecuador could not fight this problem alone: \"This is a transnational crime without a transnational security policy.\"",

      "A Nigerian senator who alleged she was sexually harassed by one of the country's top politicians has told the BBC the Senate operates like a \"cult\".",
      "A fortnight ago, Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan was suspended for six months after submitting a petition saying she had been harassed by Senate President Godswill Akpabio, which he denies.",
      "His office also rejected the cult comparison - the latest twist in a row that has gripped Nigeria, raising questions about gender equality in the socially conservative  nation.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan said she was being punished for speaking out against the system and that she now feared for her and her two-year-old's safety as her security detail had been stripped.",
      "\"The Nigerian Senate operates like a cult. The Senate president runs the Senate like a dictator, not a democrat. There is no freedom of speech, there is no freedom of expression and anyone who dares to go against him gets cut to size,\" the 45-year-old said in the first TV interview since her suspension.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Senate's Deputy Chief Whip Onyekachi Nwebonyi said Senator Akpoti-Uduaghan was not being silenced and that \"her own legislative activities disprove this claim\".",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan, who represents the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), alleged that the sexual harassment started in 2023, when she visited Akpabio's country home with her husband.",
      "She said the Akpabio \"squeezed her hand suggestively\" and said \"I will make an opportunity for us to come here and have a good moment\".",
      "Nwebonyi, who says he was also present during the visit, stated: \"At no time during the period in question did the Senate president make any unwanted sexual advances to Senator Akpoti at his country house.\"",
      "But Akpoti-Uduaghan alleged that this was just one incident of many and that the harassment continued for several months.",
      "She said that, while with other senators on the Senate's premises, Akpabio made a comment to the effect of: \"Natasha your husband is really enjoying, it looks like you'll be able to make good movements with your waist.\"",
      "\"The Senate president said this,\" Akpoti-Uduaghan told the BBC.",
      "\"He makes very sexist statements then they [senators] all laugh. He says in the Senate we're all men, she should be used to this.\"",
      "On his part, Nwebonyi said these allegations were \"completely false\".",
      "Nigeria has one of the lowest numbers of female parliamentarians in Africa.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan one of four female senators in a parliament of 109 members and she is also the first female senator in her state.",
      "Her petition against Akpabio was dismissed due to \"procedural errors\".",
      "Then, on 6 March, the ethics committee handed Akpoti-Uduaghan a six-month suspension without pay, citing \"unruly and disruptive\" behaviour during a debate in the Senate.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan told the BBC that she no longer had access to security as a result of the suspension.",
      "\"In the Nigerian space, we have had people over the past decades who have been killed for having strong views against the government,\" she said.",
      "\"If I'm taking my kid for a walk - because I have a two-year-old - will I be killed? Will I be attacked?\"",
      "Civil society groups in the country have expressed concerns over Akpoti-Uduaghan's treatment, calling for a transparent investigation into her allegations.",
      "\"All we can say is that today is a sad day for Nigerian women fighting for emancipation. Out of 109 senators, only four are women and one is now suspended,\" women's rights activist Hadiza Ado told the BBC when the suspension was imposed.",
      "While rights groups and some social media users have expressed their support for Akpoti-Uduaghan, she also has her fair share of detractors.",
      "After she was suspended, two groups of protesters gathered near parliament in the capital, Abuja - one backing the senate president and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go''.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan had also been subjected to an onslaught of misogynist abuse on social media since making the allegations, she told the BBC.",
      "The scandal is the latest episode in a political career that has been rocky from the outset.",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan first ran for governor of Kogi state in 2019 and alleged that her candidacy was challenged over her mixed-race heritage.",
      "She eventually appeared on the ballot, but was subjected to physical and verbal attacks during her campaign.",
      "In 2023, she ran for Senate and lost the election. The poll was marred by violence and after Akpoti-Uduaghan took the matter to court, the election result was overturned.",
      "\"I thought the worst was over with the elections,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"But for a woman I guess it's never really over right? It's just different parts, different chapters.\"",
      "Akpoti-Uduaghan has taken legal action in an attempt to have her suspension overturned and plans to petition the Senate again with her sexual harassment allegations.",
      "Despite the heavy emotional toll, she said she did not regret speaking out.",
      "She said she feels encouraged by her husband, child and the masses of supporters outside her family, which include female politicians from other African countries.",
      "\"I have gotten calls on a daily basis from women connecting with me and telling me they are experiencing the same thing in their parliament, but that they can't speak up,\" she said.",
      "\"They say, Natasha, do this for us. This is my story and my story is that of many women in Nigeria that do not have the courage to speak up.\"",

      "In local press, Israeli military sources have also talked about seeing an increase of Hamas activity to regroup their forces in recent days.",
      "While the truce mostly held until last night, officials at the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza have said that over 140 people have been killed by Israel in the two months since it came into effect in January.",
      "In recent weeks, the Israel military has said it's repeatedly struck targets they've identified as Hamas fighters posing a threat to its troops stationed in Gaza.",

      "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained",
      "What happened to ceasefire talks?",
      "The 19 January ceasefire deal was thrashed out over many months, with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation, and a detailed three-phase plan for how the truce should move forward.",
      "The first phase saw Hamas release 33 hostages in return for Israel releasing around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and allowing aid and other goods to enter the Gaza Strip.",
      "As the guns fell silent and thousands of displaced Gazans returned home, Hamas and Israel were due to begin negotiations to commence the second phase.",
      "The parties had agreed that the second phase negotiations would include the release of all remaining hostages as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza Strip, leading to a permanent end to the war.",
      "The first phase finished on 1 March, but the negotiations for the next stage had made no progress.",
      "Instead, Israel imposed a total halt on all aid entering Gaza causing widespread international alarm - and said that it backed a new proposal put together by the United States.",
      "In Qatar last week, Israeli and Hamas delegations gathered to negotiate how the ceasefire would progress and US envoy Steve Witkoff put forward his new \"bridging proposal\" that would have extended the expired first phase.",
      "More hostages would return home in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners being released - but, crucially, negotiations over a permanent end to the war would be delayed.",
      "Here lies a central element to why the truce has broken down.",
      "Israel's two key objectives - to return the hostages and to defeat Hamas - aren't both fully achievable together.",
      "Hamas, to put it crudely, has one card to play in the negotiations: the hostages. They don't want to release any further hostages in a next stage of the ceasefire unless it entails Israeli troops beginning to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, as agreed in the original truce.",
      "Israel is resisting this. The new, US proposal is an attempt to retrieve more hostages while delaying a commitment to ending the war and the question over whether Hamas will remain in some form.",
      "In recent days, the US and Israel have cast Hamas's preference for sticking close to the terms of the original ceasefire deal - instead of renegotiating its terms - as a \"refusal\" to extend the ceasefire.",
      "Witkoff accused Hamas of \"publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "While, in late February, Israeli officials had already briefed local press that its military wouldn't withdraw from key sites in Gaza in a breach of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "While we cannot know the detail of the negotiation talks that have taken place behind closed doors - what we do know is that Israel halting aid entering Gaza 17 days ago was an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions.",
      "That hasn't worked so far and now it appears Israel has returned to violence in order to try to extract a new deal, one that is more favourable for its political leaders, and one that offers fewer wins to Hamas.",
      "From now on, the situation in Gaza is likely to look different to the past two months of the truce.",
      "This morning the Israeli military has published a map, ordering Palestinians to leave a huge area along the perimeter of the Gaza Strip, where no doubt thousands of Gazans had returned to.",
      "Hamas, for its part, has called for a halt to Israel's military operation and, at the time of writing, has not said it will return to fighting.",
      "However, a BBC journalist near the Israel Gaza border today was told by a soldier that a call has gone out for 40,000 reservists to the Israeli army to present for duty. This seems to confirm reports in Israeli press that the military has been preparing for a renewed ground invasion in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Pursuing a renewed campaign in Gaza also presents a political boon for Prime Minister Netanyahu. This morning the hard right Jewish Power party has announced it will return to the coalition, its members including, former minister Itamar Ben Gvir, resigned in protest over the ceasefire. Having their cooperation will be crucial for the government as it seeks to pass its current budget.",
      "Israel's operations last night may have been a one-off attempt to force Hamas to concede at the negotiating table. It may, however, also herald the beginning of a fierce wave of fighting on the ground again, alarming Gaza's weary families and concerned Israeli hostage families alike.",

    "summary": "President Trump claims \"many\" of Biden's pardons are void because they were signed automatically and not by hand.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said \"many\" pardons issued by Joe Biden are void because the former president signed them with \"autopen\" - a device which reproduces a person's signature - rather than by hand.",
      "Trump did not provide evidence for his claim - which was posted on Truth Social.",
      "BBC Verify has found several instances of Biden signing pardons by hand rather than by autopen.",
      "And a sample presidential signature is used on US government documents when they are stored in the Federal Register - a digital archive. This was the case under Trump as well as under Biden.",
      "Legal experts also told us that there is nothing in US law which would invalidate pardons signed by autopen.",
      "Did Biden sign pardons using autopen?",
      "On Truth Social, Trump said that: \"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\".",
      "Trump didn't specify which pardons he was referring to but he has previously referred to the house select committee investigating the 6 January riots as the \"unselect committee\", and has criticised Biden for pardoning family members.",
      "BBC Verify looked through official photographs of Biden in the White House and ones posted on the official White House X account and found a number of examples of him signing pardons by hand.",
      "In October 2022, Biden was pictured signing an order pardoning those in jail for marijuana possession.",
      "In the same year, he also signed a pardon for non-violent offenders.",
      "It is not known whether Biden has signed any pardons only using autopen.",
      "In May last year, CNN did report that he signed a bill for a one-week extension for federal aviation funding using autopen.",
      "BBC Verify has asked Biden's office for his record of using autopen and the White House for the evidence behind Trump's claim.",
      "Trump appears to have taken his cue from the Oversight Project - part of the Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation - which has claimed that Biden's 19 January pardons - of some family members and political figures including Anthony Fauci - all had the same autopen signature.",
      "We have asked the Heritage Foundation for its workings. Previously, it has highlighted other Biden documents which it says had autopen signatures, along with screenshots taken from the Federal Register.",
      "The register is the official, daily publication of various presidential and other government documents - which all have a standard signature created from a single sample.",
      "A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checking website Snopes that: \"At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register,\"",
      "We looked through presidential documents archived by the Federal Register under both Trump administrations and found identical signatures on documents.",
      "That includes Trump's pardons for the 6 January rioters.",
      "Trump had already signed these pardons by hand, as this video showed in January.",
      "Presidential pardons are also published by the US Department of Justice. We have asked it how these documents are archived.",
      "Are documents signed with autopen legally binding?",
      "Legal experts who we spoke to told us that there is nothing in US law which says official documents signed by US presidents - including pardons - are not legally binding if they were signed with autopen.",
      "Andrew Moran, a politics professor at London Metropolitan University, says that previous presidents have used autopen before.",
      "\"On lower-level importance documents, it's not unusual for an autopen to be used.",
      "\"But I would have thought that with something as serious as a pardon Biden would have actually signed it [by hand]\", he said.",
      "A 2005 memo from the Department of Justice during the Bush administration stated that the President does not have to physically sign a bill for it to become law.",
      "\"The President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen\", the memo said.",
      "Although George W. Bush did not use autopen himself, President Obama used it in 2011.",
      "Autopen has also been used by earlier presidents including JFK and Harry Truman.",
      "Can presidents declare pardons void?",
      "Professor Erin Delaney, director of the Global Centre for Democratic Constitutionalism at UCL, says that an attempt by Trump to rescind Biden's pardons would be a \"violation of unwritten constitutional norms\".",
      "Critically, he would not be able to pursue this action without prosecuting, or re-prosecuting the individuals who were given immunity, she argues.",
      "Legally challenging Biden's pardons because of autopen would also call into question other aspects of US governance that use automatic signatures, such as bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, she added.",
      "Professor Moran says that a president revoking his predecessor's pardon is extremely rare.",
      "\"Historically, the only example I'm aware of is towards the end of Andrew Johnson's presidency in the 1860s, when he issued some pardons which were revoked before they were accepted. But that's a very small number.",
      "\"If he [Trump] decides that he wants to go after the people who were pardoned, that will end up in the courts and then that would become the point where the constitution is really tested\", he said.",

      "Ukrainian troops \"are trying to leave - columns of troops and equipment. Some of them are burned by Russian drones on the road. It is impossible to leave during the day.\"",
      "Movement of men, logistics and equipment had been reliant on one major route between Sudzha and Ukraine's Sumy region.",
      "Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. By 9 March it was \"all under the fire control of the enemy - drones around the clock. In one minute you can see two to three drones. That's a lot,\" he said.",
      "\"We have all the logistics here on one Sudzha-Sumy highway. And everyone knew that the [Russians] would try to cut it. But this again came as a surprise to our command.\"",

      "Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk \u2013 including about 12,000 North Koreans.",
      "Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to \"take fire control of the main logistics routes\".",
      "They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.",

      "The third soldier spoken to by the BBC was serving in the headquarters for the Kursk front.",
      "He too highlighted the damage caused by Russian FPV drones. \"We used to have an advantage in drones, now we do not,\" he said. He added that Russia had an advantage with more accurate air strikes and a greater number of troops.",
      "Anton said supply routes had been cut. \"Logistics no longer work \u2013 organised deliveries of weapons, ammunition, food and water are no longer possible.\"",
      "Anton said he managed to leave Sudzha by foot, at night \u2013 \"We almost died several times. Drones are in the sky all the time.\"",
      "The soldier predicted Ukraine's entire foothold in Kursk would be lost but that \"from a military point of view, the Kursk direction has exhausted itself. There is no point in keeping it any more\".",
      "Western officials estimate that Ukraine's Kursk offensive involved about 12,000 troops. They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.",
      "Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was \"fully under our control\" and that Ukraine had \"abandoned\" much of its material.",
      "Dmytro: Inches from death",

      "Vehicles were often hunted by multiple drones, he said.",
      "He described his own narrow escape when the car he was travelling in got bogged down. He and his fellow soldiers were trying to push the vehicle free when they were targeted by another FPV drone.",
      "It missed the vehicle, but injured one of his comrades. He said they had to hide in a forest for two hours before they were rescued.",
      "Dmytro said many Ukrainians retreated on foot with \"guys walking 15km to 20km\". The situation, he said, had turned from \"difficult and critical to catastrophic\".",

      "Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to \"more favourable positions\", remain in Kursk, and would do so \"for as long as it is expedient and necessary\".",
      "He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.",
      "However, the situation now is very different to last August. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.",
      "Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.",
      "Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had \"accomplished its task\" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.",

    "summary": "The prime minister hopes to achieve solid support as he visits the UK and France, writes Lyse Doucet.",
    "story": [
      "Two European politicians, dressed symbolically in red and white, sent a message last week to Canada on social media declaring \"we've got your back\".",
      "Also signalling support was King Charles, who planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and wore his Canadian medals during a high-profile visit to a naval warship.",
      "Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Paris before heading to London on Monday - a day after his 60th birthday - for his first foreign visit hoping to achieve more than symbolic encouragement. He wants solid support from allies.",
      "Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.",
      "\"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,\" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians \u2013 Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's \"51st state\".",
      "The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security \u2013 a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant \"to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships\".",
      "His itinerary is full of great symbolism too.",
      "Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed \"the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British\".",
      "So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour \u2013 Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to \"reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty\".",
      "Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.",
      "And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.",
      "His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.",
      "And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top.",
      "But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.",
      "His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a \"Trump bump\" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.",
      "Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.",
      "\"I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,\" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.",
      "Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.",
      "Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors.",

      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Canada's new top talker has been talking tough.",
      "A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. \"Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney declared to rousing applause.",
      "\"Make no mistake, Canada will win.\"",
      "But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as \"the greatest crisis of our lifetime\". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.",
      "And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.",
      "\"The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,\" he remarked. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"",
      "Carney says he \"looks forward\" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.",
      "On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his \"deepest affection\" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister.",
      "In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.",
      "Sir Keir has described Canada as \"an ally, and a very important ally too\". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the \"shocking attacks\" on its sovereignty.",

      "Out of the 261 people deported, 137 were removed under the Alien Enemies Act, a senior administration official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.",
      "This broad, centuries-old law was invoked by President Donald Trump. He accused Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" on US territory.",
      "The move has been criticised by rights groups, and came despite a temporary block issued by a judge. The White House said the judge's order itself was not lawful and was issued after the group was deported.",

      "White House denies defying judge's order over deportations",
      "What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?",
      "What is the act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an \"enemy\" nation without following the usual processes.",
      "It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.",
      "The act states that \"whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened\" against the US, all \"subjects of the hostile nation or government\" could be \"apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies\".",
      "When else has it been used?",
      "The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.",
      "It was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.",
      "People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.",
      "Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.",
      "What's Trump said - and what's been the reaction?",
      "Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.",
      "At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\".",
      "In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an \"invasion\" against the US. He declared its members \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies\".",
      "Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: \"There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.\"",
      "A federal judge attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had had \"no lawful basis\", and that the removals had already taken place.",
      "Reacting to a news article covering the judge's order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"",
      "Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\".",
      "Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.",
      "\"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings\", she added."

    "story": [
      "In September 2023, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro sent 11,000 soldiers to storm the Tocor\u00f3n Prison in the northern state of Aragua. But they were not dispatched to quell a riot.",
      "The troops were taking back control of the jail from a powerful gang that had turned it into something of a resort, complete with zoo, restaurants, nightclub, betting shop and swimming pool.",
      "But the gang's boss, Hector Guerrero Flores, escaped.",
      "Now the Tren de Aragua organisation is in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's drive to remove foreign criminals from the US as part of his pledge to deliver mass deportations of illegal immigrants.",
      "Here is what we do know about Tren de Aragua.",
      "How did the gang start?",
      "Tren de Aragua was originally a prison gang that Hector Guerrero Flores turned into a \"transnational criminal organisation\", according the US state department, which is offering a reward of $5m for information that could lead to his arrest.",
      "Guerrero Flores, 41, was in and out of Tocor\u00f3n for more than a decade.",
      "He escaped in 2012 by bribing a guard and was then rearrested in 2013. Upon his return, he transformed the prison into a leisure complex.",
      "And he expanded the gang's influence far beyond the jail's gates, seizing control of gold mines in Bolivar state, drug corridors on the Caribbean coast, and clandestine border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, according to the US state department.",
      "The gang's name translates as \"Train of Aragua\", and it may have come from a railroad workers' union. Aragua, on Venezuela's Caribbean coast, is one of the country's 23 states.",
      "Luis Izquiel, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, told the BBC that the union controlled a section of the railway that crossed Aragua and would extort contractors and sell jobs on work sites.",
      "Tren de Aragua has under Guerrero Flores's leadership expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and diversified from extorting migrants into sex-trafficking, contract killing and kidnapping.",
      "How big is the gang?",
      "By most accounts, Tren de Aragua spread out of Venezuela when the country entered a humanitarian and economic emergency in 2014 that made crime less profitable, and now is believed to have nodes in eight other countries, including the US.",
      "The group, in part, operates by forming alliances and partnerships with local criminal organisations.",
      "In Ecuador, for example, the gang is believed to work with groups loosely affiliated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, while in Colombia some have alleged that they have worked with members of the left-wing National Liberation Army guerrilla group, or ELN.",
      "Ronna R\u00edsquez, a journalist who has written the definitive book on the group, estimated last year that the organisation has 5,000 members and annual profits of between $10m and $15m.",
      "Others have estimated its membership at roughly half that figure.",
      "A prosecutor in Chile has called Tren de Aragua a \"brutal organisation\" that uses murder and torture to achieve its aims.",
      "While it is smaller or less wealthy than other criminal groups in Latin America, Tren de Aragua is often compared to the ultra-violent MS-13 gang from El Salvador.",
      "Tren de Aragua members have been accused of dressing up as Chilean police officers and then kidnapping Venezuelan opposition military officer Ronald Ojeda, whose body was found buried in Santiago, Chile, in March 2024.",
      "The US Treasury, under then-President Joe Biden, sanctioned Tren de Aragua last summer, saying that the gang was involved in sex-trafficking across the US border.",
      "Is there a threat to the US?",
      "On Saturday, Trump invoked the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act as he accused Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".",
      "He said the gang was engaged in \"irregular warfare\" against the US at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, Trump also declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation, placing the group in the same category as the Islamic State and Boko Haram, Nigeria's Islamist militants.",
      "In Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois, alleged Tren de Aragua members have been arrested in recent months and charged with crimes ranging from murder to kidnapping.",
      "In one notable example, two suspects arrested for beating a police officer in Times Square were believed to be members of the gang, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "A Tren de Aragua member is also suspected in the kidnap and murder of a 48-year old Florida resident - a Venezuelan national - in early 2024, according to local media reports.",
      "Last summer NBC News reported that the Department of Homeland estimated that 600 Venezuelan migrants in the US had connections to the gang, with 100 believed to be members.",
      "As of 2023, there were 770,000 Venezuelans living in the US, representing slightly less than 2% of all immigrants in the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "Most had been given protected status by the US government.",
      "Customs and Border Protection reports encountering 313,500 Venezuelan migrants at the border in 2024.",
      "Trump has often said that Venezuela's crime rate has fallen to record lows because the country \"emptied out its prisons\" by sending migrants to the US.",

    "summary": "Dhaka and Islamabad are growing closer after years of mistrust, but what does this mean for India?",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic political developments in Bangladesh that led to prime minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year have thrown up many surprises - including Dhaka's growing closeness with one-time foe Pakistan.",
      "Last month, after decades of troubled relations, the two countries began directly trading for the first time, with Dhaka importing 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan. Direct flights and military contacts have also been revived, visa procedures have been simplified, and there are reports of co-operation on security matters.",
      "The countries - separated by the landmass of India - have deep, painful historical ties. The animosity between them goes back to 1971, when Bangladesh - then known as East Pakistan - launched a struggle to gain independence from Islamabad. India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh.",
      "While the scars from that period run deep, Dhaka had cordial relations with Islamabad between 2001 and 2006, when a coalition of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami governed the country.",
      "This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing.",
      "\"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\".",
      "The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.",
      "Relations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her.",
      "Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move.",
      "\"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London.",
      "There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade.",
      "Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months.",
      "And then there is a growing military relationship.",
      "A high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir. The Bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by Pakistan off the Karachi coast in February. .",
      "Veena Sikri, who was India's high commissioner to Bangladesh between 2003 and 2006, describes the growing closeness between Dhaka and Islamabad as a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment.",
      "During her tenure in Dhaka, she said, India repeatedly raised the issue of \"Indian insurgents getting trained inside Bangladesh with the support of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency] and a section of the Bangladeshi military\".",
      "\"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said.",
      "Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time.",
      "The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases.",
      "So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri.",
      "\"It's not just the military relationship. The Pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with Bangladeshi Islamist parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Islamabad during Bangladesh's independence war,\" she adds.",
      "The Yunus administration's press office has flatly rejected Indian media reports that senior ISI officials have visited Dhaka. It has also described reports that claim Pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an Indian insurgent group in Bangladesh as \"baseless\".",
      "Pakistan's military did not respond to BBC questions on India's concerns over the future role of the ISI in Bangladesh.",
      "Analysts say Bangladeshi politicians are aware that, given the close economic and linguistic ties, Dhaka cannot afford to take an anti-India stance.",
      "And despite apprehensions in Delhi, Bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with Pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved.",
      "During the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad.",
      "Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so.",
      "\"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\"",
      "Even former Pakistani military officers like Ikram Sehgal accept that \"the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the Bangladeshis that Pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971\".",
      "However, the retired Pakistan army major insists that Bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by Bengalis on Urdu speakers during the struggle for independence.",
      "\"I was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the Urdu-speaking Bihari people [in East Pakistan],\" Mr Sehgal, who now lives in Karachi, told the BBC.",
      "While history casts a shadow over ties between Dhaka and Islamabad, economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade, which currently stands at less than $700m (\u00a3540m), mostly in favour of Pakistan.",
      "\"Pakistan's more than 250 million population is a solid market for Bangladesh in the medium to long term,\" says Sabrin Beg, an associate professor of economics at the University of Delaware.",
      "Currently, there are constraints including high tariffs on both sides and businesses and exporters face visa and travel obstacles, she points out. However, Ms Beg says \"improved bilateral political and trade relations will ease these constraints\".",
      "Some of these issues may be discussed during Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Dhaka in April. By the end of the year Bangladesh is expected to hold general elections and a new government may have a different set of foreign policy priorities.",
      "But, whatever happens, the stakes are high for Delhi, which strongly feels that a stable and friendly Bangladesh is necessary to maintain peace and stability in its north-eastern states.",

      "Details continue to emerge about the deaths of\u00a0Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog after they were\u00a0found dead in their home\u00a0in New Mexico on Feb. 26.",
      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death. Here's what we know from officials.",
      "What did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die from?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Cellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.",
      "Based on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",

He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",

      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Terry Jon Martin   stole them.  Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions.",

      "Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. Martin's attorneys described the theft as \"one last score\" for the aging reformed mobster. But Martin got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

An estimated 19.7 million viewers watched the 97th Academy Awards ceremony earlier this month, according to broadcaster ABC, with a big lift among people aged 18 to 49, driven by mobile and laptop watches from younger viewers. It was also the most watched prime-time entertainment show of 2025.",

      "WILLIAM: When I was a boy, my father, an Air Force fighter pilot, would tell me stories before bedtime, making up characters and weaving them into exciting tales of adventure. Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",

      "KELLY: I've always understood the power of storytelling, but as a new mother, I'm even more aware of how crucial it is to continue our family tradition of reading to my daughter. At a time when reading levels are declining and screen time is on the rise, it's more important than ever to share stories that teach valuable lessons in fun and engaging ways.",

    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

      "A political moderate, Republican Senator Alan Simpson (Sept. 2, 1931-March 14, 2025) served three terms representing Wyoming, from 1979 to 1997, and played a key role in rallying GOP support around the party's legislative agenda.",
      "At 6-foot-7 (he was the tallest Senator up to that time) with a quick wit, Simpson was able to bridge partisan impasses, and foster relationships across the aisle at a time of increasing political acrimony. \"The word 'politics' is interesting,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, \"because it comes from the Greek, you know that? Poly, meaning many, and tics, meaning blood-sucking insects!\"",
      "Simpson maintained his own views even when they crossed Republican orthodoxy. A deficit hawk, Simpson also supported abortion rights. He served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.",
      "After leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he urged college students to become politically involved.",
      "In 2022, President Joe Biden awarded Simpson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",
      "One of Simpson's closest friends was a Democrat, Norman Mineta, a Congressman from California who also served as Commerce Secretary under President Bill Clinton and as Transportation Secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "The two had met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyo., during World War II. Simpson and Menieta bonded over playing pranks on the other Scouts, including a bully whose tent they sabotaged: \"It was raining to beat hell and we kinda channeled the water down into this guy's tent,\" Simpson told \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "The two friends would not see each other until decades later, when Mineta (who had become Mayor of San Jose, Calif.), won election to Congress. \"And there we were, and we started right over just like that,\" Simpson said.",
      "Mineta said, \"We'd have fights in the sub-committee, the full committee, and yet we'd slap each other on the back and say, 'Come on, let's go have dinner, let's go have a drink.' And they don't do that [today]. They just don't have that kind of personal relationship.\"",
      "In 1988 Simpson and Mineta joined forces to help pass the Civil Liberties Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, which for the very first time formally apologized to Japanese-Americans, and granted reparations to those who had been imprisoned."

      "Washington \u2014 The White House is withdrawing former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon's nomination to be the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a White House official confirmed Thursday.",
      "An administration official who was asked about why Weldon's nomination was withdrawn responded, \"It was clear he did not have the votes in the Senate.\"",
      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",

      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly signaled of late that policymakers are in no hurry to lower borrowing costs\u00a0for consumers and business. His bigger challenge: How to provide a measure of certainty on the direction of monetary policy as investors try to peer through the fog of uncertainty enveloping the global economy.",
      "Stocks edged up in morning trade ahead of the Fed's decision, with the S&P 500 rising 39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,653, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5% and 1%, respectively.",
      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners. The barrage of tariffs President Trump has aimed at Canada, China, Mexico, Europe and other countries has yet to make a deep mark on the U.S. economy, but experts warn the trade measures could drive up inflation and slam growth \u2014 a toxic stew known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "Despite signs that the economy is weakening, most Wall Street economists don't expect a recession anytime soon. And in spite of market turbulence caused by Mr. Trump's tariff threats, some experts think stocks are likely to gain strength in the months to come, although not without periodic bouts of volatility.",
      "\"We continue to expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of the year supported by Fed easing, healthy economic and profit growth, as well as AI spending and adoption,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email on Wednesday. \"Investors should consider buying the dip in quality AI stocks, and utilize structured strategies to manage downside risks in their equity exposure.\"",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report ahead of the Fed meeting that \"markets may have recently become overly pessimistic.\" Although he doesn't expect a recession, he forecasts slower economic growth and described the economy as \"vulnerable.\"",
      "The impact of tariffs and the health of the economy will, of course, help shape the Fed's decision on interest rates, and for policymakers the task amounts to threading the needle. Easing borrowing costs sooner rather than later would shore up growth, but also boost inflation \u2014 anathema to consumers worn down by nearly three years of high prices. By contrast, waiting too long to cut rates could cause the economy to stall.",
      "Investors now think there's a good chance the Fed will lower the federal funds rate three times this year, or a total of three-quarters of a percentage point, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.",

While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.",
      "There has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",

Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.",

      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",

Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.",
      "President Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"",

In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"",

      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Another possibility: stagflation",
      "Still, some economists are warning of another, potentially worse outcome for the U.S. economy: stagflation. That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in the monthly report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes were back in the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 60 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,615, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 260 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 305 points, or 1.7%.",
      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes. Over the first three months of 2025, the country's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 1.2%, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.",
      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",
      "And despite the market turbulence, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst with eToro, notes that nine of 11 S&P sectors remain in positive territory in 2025. The two sectors that have sunk \u2014 technology and consumer discretionary \u2014 have fallen 7% and nearly 12%, respectively.",
      "\"Because investors' favorite stocks (and those with a heavy weighting in the index) have suffered so much, it's likely impacting investor sentiment disproportionately vs. an otherwise more orderly decline,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Historically, similar levels in sentiment have coincided with at least a short-term bottom in U.S. stocks, although it's not clear that we've seen a capitulatory type move that generally marks the bottom.\"",

      "During the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties. The company reiterated that stance in a lawsuit filed late last week, describing itself as a logistics provider rather than a distributor.",
      "\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.",

    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

      "\"The fixer-upper buyer is often more price-conscious to begin with, so the tariff premium is a tough pill to swallow,\" she said.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, obtained wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a Canadian company that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "But by sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago, he told the Associated Press.",
      "\"I'm not about to go out of business, but it's looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\" he said.",
      "Still, Kraut notes there are limits to how much homebuilders can lift prices to offset their own rising costs. \"You can only pass through so much to the consumer, and if the Walmarts and Targets and homebuilders say we can't afford these prices, they'll say you have to lower lumber prices coming out of Canada or we aren't going to buy it.\"",

    "summary": "The first weeks of the new Trump administration have sparked stock market jitters and recession fears. Here's advice from top experts.",
    "story": [
      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",
      "Broad-based tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, plus 25% levies on steel and aluminum threaten to raise costs for both businesses and consumers. Smaller companies with tighter profit margins have a harder time absorbing greater input costs compared to larger ones.",
      "Canary in the coal mine",
      "The Russell 2000 comprises small companies across a variety sectors, and is widely considered to be a benchmark for small U.S. stocks. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, it is not weighted toward a particular industry.",
      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",
      "\"These companies have much thinner margins, so a rise in input costs hurts them more,\" Carey Hall said.",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration could soon lose as many as 10,000 workers, according to former agency leaders who expect a large portion of federal workers to accept a buyout offer from the agency.",
      "The SSA last month\u00a0announced a restructuring initiative that gives all employees the option to accept \"voluntary separation incentive payments\" to leave the agency, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE's effort to cut costs\u00a0by culling the federal workforce. Led by billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has\u00a0abruptly terminated thousands of federal workers\u00a0over the last three weeks, causing turmoil across multiple departments.",
      "The deadline for SSA workers to accept the \"voluntary separation incentive payments\"\u00a0is Friday, March 14. Those who opt in must leave the agency by April 19.",
      "Last month, the agency said it aims to cut the size of its workforce by 7,000 people, focusing on workers and jobs that don't \"provide mission critical services.\"",
      "Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be closer to 10,000 workers. The agency currently employs roughly 57,000 people.",
      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",
      "\"They are all going to take it,\" he said, adding that employees who choose to stay, will risk losing their jobs without a bonus.",
      "\"They are communicating to people if you don't take the cash and get out now, you are taking the chance of being fired and playing the game of Russian Roulette that follows,\" said O'Malley, who believes the changes being implemented at the agency will \"cause a total system collapse of social security.\"",
      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",
      "O'Malley is also concerned that offering to buy workers out in the name of efficiency amounts to the \"greatest amount of waste in operational history by paying people not to work.\"",
      "Security vunerabilities",
      "Former SSA commissioner Michael Astrue added that the staff cuts could lead to vulnerabilities at the agency, if employees tasked with protecting sensitive data choose to exit.",
      "\"We should be petrified about privacy and the theft of data,\" he said at the NASI panel discussion.",
      "In the past, attempts made by adversaries to access proprietary information \"have been consistently thwarted\" with staff in place to safeguard data, Astrue noted. \"It is a daunting thing to imagine what a foreign power might do with broad access to this kind of data.\"",

    "summary": "The president threatened to take retaliatory action in response to EU tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on wines, Champagnes and other alcoholic products imported to the U.S. from France and other European countries in response to raised tariffs the European Union placed on American whiskey.",
      "In a post to Truth Social, the social media company the president owns, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will retaliate against the European Union after it announced Wednesday that it would be increasing tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey to 50%.",
      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

      "Workers linked to DOGE have examined how they might use the IRS' tax data, according to the Wall Street Journal, which noted that such information could be used to check if an individual qualifies for federal benefits and for immigration enforcement.",
      "The IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivized buyouts as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The administration is closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \"deferred resignation program\" to quickly reduce the government workforce.",
      "Already, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with roughly one year or less of service were laid off from the organization in February.",
      "But the mass layoffs of probationary workers are now in doubt after a federal judge in California on Thursday ruled that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful and ordered six federal agencies to reinstate\u00a0the employees. The decision by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco followed a legal challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration.",

      "After 30 years of service, Michelle King, the SSA's acting commissioner, stepped down from her role in February after refusing to provide DOGE access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. King was replaced by Leland Dudek, who oversaw the SSA's fraud investigation office.",
      "\"The series of IRS officials who have put the law above their personal job security join a line of public servants, stretching back to Treasury and IRS leaders during the Nixon era, who have resisted unlawful attempts by elected officials to weaponize taxpayer data and systems,\" Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University School of Law, said in a statement.",

Her LinkedIn page lists her as a\u00a0U.S. Digital Service\u00a0senior adviser, and she has a background in consulting and the medical field. Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",
      "\"USDA can confirm it has provided notice to States, Territories and Tribes that the FY 2025 funding previously announced for the pandemic-era Local Food for Schools and Child Care Cooperative Agreement and pandemic-era Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement program is no longer available and those agreements will be terminated following 60-day notification,\" a spokesperson with the\u00a0agency said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste.

      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",

      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ftc-amazon-lawsuit-request-for-delay/",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:02:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission says agency needs to seek trial delay in case against Amazon due to staffing and budgetary challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\"Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\" Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\"",
      "When the judge asked if the agency's challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \"Fork in the road\" email sent by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \"things are going to be different in two months\" with the issues the agency is experiencing.",
      "Cohen responded by saying he \"cannot guarantee if things won't be even worse.\"",
      "\"But there are a lot of reasons to believe ... we have been through the brunt of it, at least for a while,\" he said.",
      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",
      "\"We really want to keep the date\" for the trial, Hueston said.",
      "Amazon Prime enrollment",
      "The lawsuit, which was brought under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, alleged Amazon had enrolled consumers in the Prime program without consent and made it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.",
      "The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets. Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",
      "In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he was \"optimistic\" about Trump's second term. The same month, the company said it would donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Bezos, along with other tech leaders, was also a guest at the inauguration.",
      "This week, Amazon's Prime Video service began streaming \"The Apprentice,\" the long-running TV show that boosted Trump's profile before he ran for president. The company is also working on a documentary that offers an \"unprecedented behind-the-scenes look\" into the life of first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Bezos has made changes to The Washington Post, which he owns, that some critics have cast as favorable to Trump.",
      "Before the election, Bezos defended the newspaper's decision not to endorse a presidential candidate as \"right\" and \"principled.\" He rejected speculation that he ordered the non-endorsement to protect his business interests.",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on the phone Wednesday morning in a call that lasted roughly an hour, Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\"Just completed a very good telephone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine,\" the president\u00a0wrote. \"It lasted approximately one hour. Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track, and I will ask Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and national security adviser Michael Waltz, to give an accurate description of the points discussed. That statement will be put out shortly.\"",
      "The call comes a day after Mr. Trump's lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Mr. Trump said Putin agreed to a 30-day ceasefire against Ukraine's energy and infrastructure. The commitment fell short of the full ceasefire pushed by the U.S. and agreed to by Ukraine. Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday night that \"only a real halt to Russia's attacks on civilian infrastructure can signal a genuine desire to end this war and bring peace closer.\"",
      "Wednesday's call is the first known conversation between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy their\u00a0disastrous Oval Office meeting last month that resulted in U.S. officials telling Ukrainians to leave the White House early.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he believes Putin wants peace, with little evidence to support that claim, three years after Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "On Wednesday, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said Putin is operating in \"good faith\" and the Russian leader issued an order following his call with Mr. Trump directing Russian forces not to attack Ukrainian energy infrastructure.",
      "Zelenskyy has expressed skepticism toward the idea that Putin wants peace.",
      "\"We are skeptical when it comes to trusting the Russians,\" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. \"There is no trust to Putin. That's why I am saying we need to understand how it will work technically so that it will not depend on their desire only. That is it.\"",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said \"technical teams\" are heading to Saudi Arabia on Monday to try to hammer out terms of a ceasefire.",
      "\"I spoke today with my Russian counterpart Yuri Ushakov about President Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine,\" Waltz wrote on X. \"We agreed our technical teams would meet in Riyadh in the coming days to focus on implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire President Trump secured from Russia.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has repeatedly said the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 250 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",
      "The Associated Press was the first to report Friday that the U.S. and Israel had contacted Sudan, Somalia, and also Somaliland, about resettling Palestinians from Gaza.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination files release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents, totaling some 80,000 pages, had been released before, with sections redacted for national security purposes. The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on an initial review by CBS News. But the unveiling of key portions of the records was cheered by researchers and academics who had long argued that the details in certain reports by the CIA and FBI should have been disclosed years ago.",
      "\"This is the most positive news on the release of JFK files since the 1990s,\" said Jefferson Morley, an investigative journalist and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, which hosts a repository of JFK-related documents. He called the release an \"encouraging start\" while noting that other troves of documents still remain under wraps.",
      "The records were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of files related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "The records are unredacted versions of documents that have been released in redacted form in the past. Agencies like the CIA and FBI have argued over the years that the release of the information would harm national security, even decades after the fact.",
      "According to Morley, roughly 3,500 documents in the government's official collection of JFK files contained redactions before the latest release. There were 1,123 documents of varying lengths unveiled Tuesday, meaning about a third of the remaining redacted documents have been released in full. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 IRS records have been withheld from public release entirely.",
      "\"These new records shed new light on the events leading to JFK's assassination, including his mistrust of the CIA, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and propaganda operations involving Oswald before and after JFK was killed,\" Morley said in a statement referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. Oswald sought a visa to return to the Soviet Union in October 1963 while in Mexico City, and technical details of the CIA's surveillance operations were revealed for the first time in Tuesday's release.",
      "Another notable document released in full for the first time is a\u00a0memo prepared by Kennedy adviser Arthur Schlesinger Jr. about a potential reorganization of the CIA after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The\u00a0previously redacted\u00a0section details the number of CIA personnel stationed undercover overseas, with Schlesinger expressing concern that covert CIA activities were encroaching on the State Department.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had\u00a0discovered\u00a0roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action. Those records did not appear in Tuesday's release, according to Morley.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. The IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination, a fact that the CIA withheld from the Warren Commission. Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and the documents released Tuesday detail some technical aspects of the CIA's surveillance of Oswald and Cuban and Soviet officials.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 09:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes ruled in favor of transgender active-duty service members and transgender people in the process of enlisting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a new Defense Department policy barring transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by transgender active-duty service members and transgender people who are in the process of enlisting. The judge's order temporarily blocks Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the military services from implementing President Trump's executive order and additional guidance that prohibits transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "But the judge put her order on hold until March 21 to give the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, issued her decision after holding several hours of hearings earlier this month, during which she sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about the Defense Department's justifications for the ban.",
      "\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in her 79-page decision, later adding, \"The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple.\u00a0 In the self-evident truth that 'all people are created equal,' all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\"",
      "Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights for GLAD Law, one of the lead attorneys in the case, called the ruling \"decisive\" and said it \"speaks volumes.\"",
      "\"The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal,\" Levi said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department called the ruling \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people, who decisively voted to elect President Trump.\"",
      "The policy arose out of an executive order Mr. Trump issued in late January that directed Hegseth to implement a policy for transgender service members based on troop readiness. The order stated that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "The executive order also\u00a0revoked a measure implemented in January 2021 by then-President Joe Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive, Hegseth issued a memorandum in early February that halted recruitment of new service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria and paused gender-affirming care for transgender troops. The Pentagon then said in a late February document that the U.S. would begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "The memo said that individuals with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \"are no longer eligible for military service.\" It also said that pronoun usage when referring to a service member must reflect his or her sex and barred the use of Pentagon funds for gender-affirming care.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a January report from the Congressional Research Service. While a Justice Department lawyer told the court earlier this month that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a February 26 memo from the Pentagon.",
      "The lawsuit before Reyes was filed in late January by a group of more than a dozen transgender active-duty service members, one person enlisted in U.S. Army basic training and five transgender people who were in the process of enlisting. They argued that the ban was unconstitutional and sought a court order blocking its enforcement.",
      "In her decision, Reyes found that the challengers were likely to succeed on their claim that the ban fails a higher level of judicial scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and transgender status. The judge also held that the Trump administration's policy is likely driven by unconstitutional animus.",
      "\"The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" she wrote. \"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\"",
      "Reyes wrote that Mr. Trump and the Defense Department \"could have crafted a policy that balances the nation's need for a prepared military and Americans' right to equal protection. They still can. The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"",
      "The judge said government's policy is \"overbroad\" and also includes \"derogatory generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons.\" Such generalizations, Reyes wrote, \"do not suffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness and unit cohesion.\"",
      "The decision from Reyes is likely to be appealed by the Justice Department, but it is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration, since several of its policies have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. A second challenge to the Mr. Trump's military ban is currently underway in Washington state.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, in 2017, but an initial Pentagon policy was blocked by federal courts. The plan was then revised in 2018, and it took effect the following year and remained in place until the start of the Biden administration.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 22:21:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were tapped by the treasury secretary to lead reform efforts at the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has promoted two agents with the Internal Revenue Service who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about political interference into their investigation of Hunter Biden's tax crimes.",
      "IRS special agents Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were assigned to Bessent's office as senior advisers for IRS reform, and Shapley was named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",
      "The promotions stand in stark contrast to President Trump's decision on Monday to revoke Secret Service protections for Hunter Biden, despite an executive order signed by his father, former President Joe Biden, extending those protections through July.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler first came forward in 2023, alleging the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father. They were removed from the case \u2014 and temporarily sidelined with pay.",
      "The duo's disclosures came ahead of a series of court decisions that ultimately led President Biden to pardon his son for the crimes related to the agents' investigation. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to those crimes after a Delaware judge rejected a plea deal that would have given him broad immunity.",
      "\"We have been motivated by one singular mantra: do what's right,\" Shapley said in a statement. \"It's never been easy, and there have been more pitfalls than one would hope, but we appreciate the opportunity Secretary Bessent is giving us to utilize our skills and firsthand knowledge of the agency to further the work of the administration to root out waste and fraud from the federal government and make a difference.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Bessent said he is giving Shapley and Ziegler \"a year to investigate the wrongdoing that's going on at the IRS,\" adding that they will make sure \"this Hunter Biden nonsense\" doesn't repeat itself.",
      "The new assignments come as the IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through layoffs, attrition and buyouts, part of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government. And the prominent postings are an abrupt departure from the tenuous relationship the two IRS whistleblowers previously had with the tax agency.",
      "In December, the federal watchdog that investigates whistleblower complaints substantiated claims by Shapley and Ziegler alleging the IRS had retaliated against them when agency leadership had removed the two agents from the Hunter Biden case at DOJ's request.",
      "The retaliation claim was part of an effort by Shapley and Ziegler to push back against what they believed was a wide-ranging effort by Hunter Biden's attorneys to discredit them. In September, the two men sued Abbe Lowell \u2013 one of Hunter Biden's attorneys \u2013 for defamation. Lowell responded by strenuously disputing the allegations and calling Shapley and Ziegler \"disgruntled.\"",
      "As for Hunter Biden, he recently was granted approval by a California judge to drop a lawsuit he filed against a former Trump White House aide he accused of illegally publishing private photos, emails, and other materials from his now-infamous laptop.",
      "In court documents, Hunter Biden cited financial reasons for dropping the lawsuit. He said his \"income has decreased significantly\" as sales of his art have dried up in the past year, and he was forced out of the house he was renting due to the fires that ravaged Los Angeles in January.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The chief justice's statement came after President Trump called for a federal judge to be impeached.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday defending federal judges who have issued decisions against the Trump administration, saying that \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement\" with a court's decision.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement distributed by the Supreme Court's public information office. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts' statement comes after President Trump attacked a federal district judge on Truth Social and called for his impeachment. The judge, James Boasberg, temporarily\u00a0blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from using the wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport noncitizens.",
      "Boasberg had issued an oral order from the bench requiring planes carrying 261 people that were on their way to Central America to return to the U.S. The Trump administration had alleged that 137 of the people on board the planes had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite Boasberg's order, two planes landed in El Salvador, sparking allegations that the Trump administration had defied a court order.",
      "\"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn't WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn't WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn't WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Mr. Trump wrote in his post.",
      "The president added that Boasberg and \"many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before\" should be \"IMPEACHED!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's targeting of Boasberg, who was appointed to the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., by President Barack Obama, is an escalation in the ongoing attacks on federal judges who have been overseeing the dozens of challenges to the president's policies. Some of those judges have ordered the Trump administration to put its plans on hold while legal proceedings move forward, sparking condemnations from the president's allies and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department has appealed many of those rulings and sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court\u00a0in three court fights\u00a0so far.",
      "Federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed from the bench if they are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. Just 15 judges have been impeached in U.S. history, most recently in 2010. Eight of those 15 have been convicted and removed from office.",
      "Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president, has taken to social media repeatedly to call on the judges to be impeached, claiming they are \"evil.\"",
      "In a\u00a0post last month on X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges.\" In\u00a0another post, he wrote that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also\u00a0introduced impeachment resolutions\u00a0against at least three judges because of rulings they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "In response to the attacks on members of the judiciary, two Republican-appointed judges warned last week that they strike at judicial independence.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" Judge Richard Sullivan, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, said during a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Judge Jeffrey Sutton, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, said it's a \"shame\" to see judges attacked simply for doing their jobs.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" he said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before, namely in his year-end report issued to close out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "Roberts is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the judiciary. Such statements from the chief justice are rare, but it is not the first time Roberts has pushed back against Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "In 2018, after the president complained about a federal judge who ruled against an asylum policy during his first term and referred to him as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts said the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"",

      "Hours after the call, air raid sirens sounded and explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. The White House and the Kremlin both said they agreed to begin negotiations \"immediately\" to achieve a fuller ceasefire. A Russian readout of the call from the Kremlin said a key condition for working toward a resolution to the conflict \"should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.\" The White House readout did not contain that information, or Mr. Trump's response.",
      "\"My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine. ... Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end.\"",

The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Mr. Trump has his number and can call him at any time.",

    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration over use of a war authority to deport alleged gang members warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "The lawyers for Venezuelan migrants suing the government said Tuesday in an appellate court filing: \"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"",
      "Those subject to the 1798 Alien Enemies Act can be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday, and used it to send two planes carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "In a hearing Saturday, D.C. U.S. Chief District Judge James Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate Justice Department appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer provided new details about the Trump administration's deportation flights of alleged gang members, but continued to argue the government had a right to reject a judge's order directing the planes to return to the U.S., even if they were already in the air.",
      "According to a sworn declaration by Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of ICE's enforcement and removal operations, the two planes \"departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 p.m.\" on Saturday \u2014 40 minutes after D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be returned to the U.S. during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "The government reiterated Tuesday that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration had also argued in a hearing on Monday that Boasberg did not have authority to redirect the planes because the judge had not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing. The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "Cerna said the government's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to justify the removal of alleged Tren de Aragua members was signed Friday evening, a day before the flights were publicly announced on Saturday by the White House.",
      "His testimony is part of a court-mandated series of responses to Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday. The rest of the answers Boasberg requested are likely to remain private because of \"operational issues,\" a Justice Department attorney told the court, declining to provide the court with this information publicly.",
      "Those details are likely to include whether additional planes have left the U.S. with alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Cerna's sworn testimony did not provide all of this information, though he noted that 54 members of Tren de Aragua are in detention in the U.S., and approximately 172 are on the non-detained docket, which means they are not being detained by the government as their immigration proceedings continue. There are also approximately 32 are in criminal custody who have active detainers \u2014 that is, ICE has asked that they be held for up to 48 hours after they're scheduled to be released.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",

    "story": [
      "London - Some court documents related to a freedom of information request to access Prince Harry's U.S. immigration files were released on Tuesday, under an order issued by a Washington D.C. district court, after the conservative Heritage Foundation alleged that the British royal\u00a0may have concealed past drug use when he applied for his visa. Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "The documents released included court filings from several federal agencies responding to the Heritage Foundation's request. They did not include the prince's immigration records. Portions of the documents relating to him or his immigration status were heavily redacted.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S.",
      "\"There's a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation alleges that Harry may have lied about his past drug use on his application. Their allegations center around claims Harry made in his memoir, published in January 2023, where he described using various types of drugs.",
      "Cocaine \"wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,\" Harry wrote.",
      "He also wrote: \"Marijuana is different. That actually really did help me.\"",
      "The Heritage Foundation lodged a freedom of information request with the Department of Homeland Security in 2023, not long after his book was published, seeking access to Harry's immigration documents.",
      "\"Harry has publicly admitted to extensive illegal drug use. What do we submit this means? That Harry seems to have received special treatment: the DHS looked the other way if the Prince answered truthfully, or it looked the other way if the Prince lied on his visa application. Either action would be wrong,\" Nile Gardiner from the Heritage Foundation said in an online post in 2024.",
      "Harry and Meghan moved to the U.S. in 2020 after stepping down as working members of Britain's royal family.",
      "Meghan is a U.S. citizen, but it is unclear what visa Harry entered the country on. The prince has not responded publicly to the Heritage Foundation's assertions.",
      "In February, President Trump ruled out deporting Harry, saying he would \"leave him alone,\" adding, \"He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.\"",
      "Meghan has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Most Americans dislike the idea of celebrities being treated differently from anyone else, and Harry's fame and profile makes this case the ideal window into DHS conduct,\" the Heritage Foundation's Gardiner argued. \"If DHS granted Harry special treatment, the implications are obvious: it has likely granted such treatment in the past to others sufficiently famous or sufficiently politically aligned, and will likely continue to do so.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:29:26 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed former and current USAID employees and contractors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

      "During an investigation, the attorney general's office found that Rojas owned and operated multiple clinics under the names Clinica Waller Latinoamericana in Waller, Clinica Latinoamericana Telge in Cypress, both northwest of Houston, and Latinoamericana Medical Clinic in Spring, just north of Houston.",
      "The press release from Paxton's office alleged that Rojas' clinics employed unlicensed people who \"falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals.\"",
      "Jose Manuel Cendan Ley was also taken into custody on Monday and charged with an unlawful performance of an abortion and unlicensed practice of medicine. According to Paxton, Ley performed illegal medical procedures and assisted Rojas in at least one abortion procedure.",

I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individual endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,\" Paxton said. \"Texas law protecting life is clear and we will hold those who violate it accountable.\"",

      "Following Rojas' arrest, Paxton's Healthcare Program Enforcement Division filed for a temporary restraining order to shut down all of the clinics Rojas owned and operated.",
      "Marc Hearron, interim associate director of U.S. litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement: \"While details of this case remain unclear, we know that Texas officials have been trying every which way to terrify healthcare practitioners from providing care and to trap Texans. Their ultimate goal is to end abortion access for all Texans entirely\u2014and they will throw people in jail to get there.\"",
      "Paxton also announced Tuesday that Rubildo Labanino Matos, 54, had been arrested on March 8 in connection to the investigation. Paxton said Matos is a nurse practitioner whose license is currently on probation by the Board of Nursing. He was charged with conspiracy to practice medicine without a license.",
      "What is the Texas Human Life Protection Act?",
      "Under the Texas Human Life Protection Act of 2021, the Texas attorney general has the authority to seek civil penalties of at least $100,000 per violation for the unlawful performance of an abortion.",

      "Attorney Will Vaughn, who is not involved in the case, told CBS Houston affiliate KHOU it could lead to a legal challenge of the state law. \"We can all foresee this being a constitutional challenge at the U.S. Supreme Court, and that would be not so much challenging the conviction, if there were one, but challenging the constitutionally of the statute as a whole,\" Vaughn said.",

But a day later, he reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage. The move has prompted frustrations among some within his party, and questions about his leadership, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision.",
      "\"I knew when I took this vote there'd be a lot of protests, but I felt I had to do it for the future, not only of the Democratic Party, but the country,\" Schumer said, adding that \"as bad as that CR bill was \u2014 and it was bad \u2014 a shutdown is 10 times worse.\"",

      "On the question of his leadership, Schumer said he isn't going anywhere, citing his record as leader on winning Senate seats, including in 2021, when Democrats secured a majority in the upper chamber with two surprise runoff victories in Georgia. Schumer came to Congress in 1981, representing New York in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He's led Democrats as leader in the Senate since 2017.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The government-funded news agency stopped broadcasting after its employees were put on leave or terminated.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's dismantling of the government-funded Voice of America will pave the way for America's adversaries to have greater influence abroad, predicted the agency's director Michael Abramowitz.",
      "After Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.",
      "\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.\"",
      "VOA reports news about the U.S. in nearly 50 languages \u2014 with much of its focus trained on countries that lack a free press. By law, the broadcasts do not air inside the U.S., but news programming is viewed widely \u2014 with an audience of about 360 million people per week worldwide.",
      "\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. \u2026 So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"",
      "\"That has never been more important with a sea of lies and disinformation that are going on around the world,\" he added.",
      "Still, Abramowitz acknowledged\tthat VOA, which has a $270 million annual budget, could be reformed and that it should \"not be resistant to change.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying it has to be the way it's always been,\" Abramowitz said. \"Change is great. Change is needed. Change is required.\"",
      "\"I don't personally think it's a waste of taxpayer money,\" he argued. \"Does that mean that it has to be a $270 million budget? Maybe it could be [$240 million], maybe it could be [$200 million]. Look, we are in an era where the taxpayer expects a smaller, more modernized, more streamlined government.\"",
      "He defended VOA's journalists as non-partisan and said if they harbored any bias, it is against totalitarianism, tyranny and authoritarianism.",
      "\"If you care about a free Iran, if you care about more openness in China, if you care about freedom in Russia, if you care about freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua, then you have an incredibly important tool in VOA to help push back and to get accurate and objective information into these places that don't have it,\" he said. \"That is incredibly important.\"",

      "President Trump announced that tens of thousands of pages of the JFK assassination files would be released to the public Tuesday.",
      "\"People have been waiting decades for this,\" the president said of the release of files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Trump, who was speaking at the Kennedy Center Monday, added that he didn't believe the material, \"approximately 80,000 pages,\" would be redacted.",
      "\"I said during the campaign that I'd do it, and I'm a man of my word,\" the president said of the impending release.",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had discovered roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action ordering files related to the 1963 killing to be declassified.",
      "The bureau said that the documents, which have been inventoried and digitized, \"were previously unrecognized as related to the JFK assassination case file.\" The FBI in February was transferring the records to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the ongoing declassification process that has been ongoing. The bureau did not say what the records contain.",
      "In his first week in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that called for the declassification of these files and also those related to the assassinations of his brother Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "The order gave the director of national intelligence and attorney general 15 days to present a plan to the president for the \"full and complete release of records\" related to Kennedy's assassination.",
      "Congress in 1992 enacted the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which required all assassination-related material be kept in a single collection within the National Archives and be publicly released. The law gave federal agencies 25 years to process and disclose the documents, with exceptions. The collection at the National Archives consists of more than 5 million pages of records.",
      "The National Archives has over the last three decades made material related to Kennedy's assassination available to the public, with the latest batch disclosed in August 2023.

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:44:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The government claimed it was not bound by the judge's order to block flights carrying gang members to El Salvador because it wasn't in writing.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge admonished the Justice Department Monday for disobeying his order to turn around two planes en route to El Salvador that were carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. He also demanded explanations about removal flights ordered since President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act\u00a0Saturday.",
      "During a hearing on the Trump administration's compliance with his order, D.C District Chief Judge James Boasberg demanded answers by Tuesday at noon to clarify what occurred Saturday \u2014 both before and after he blocked the government's removal flights. He asked the government whether additional planes have left the U.S. with Tren de Aragua gang members, and he wants a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Boasberg also demanded detailed timing on when President Trump's order invoking the Alien Enemies Act was signed and went into effect. The 1798 act is a wartime authority allowing the president to detain and deport noncitizens. Mr. Trump is utilizing the act to detain and deport all Venezuelan migrants 14 years of age and older who are suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "A Justice Department attorney argued that because the judge did not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing, the government was not bound by it, but he added that even if the order had been written, the president had the authority to keep the flights en route to their final destination.",
      "\"You're telling me your first argument is when I said those things, because I didn't say it in a minute order that the plaintiffs didn't have to turn around, you didn't have to comply?\" Boasberg said. \"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\"",
      "The attorney did not provide details about how many deportation flights left Saturday, claiming that there were \"operational issues\" prohibiting him from answering. When Judge Boesberg mentioned the two flights that departed Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. local time, the attorney said that he was \"not at liberty\" to provide information about the flights.",
      "It sparked a tense back and forth between Judge Boesberg and the government over whether or not it was asserting the flight information was classified.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, that Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "The Trump administration said the two planes had left before the judge made his decision, and a third plane left for El Salvador shortly afterwards, though details about the passengers on that plane are unclear.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday,137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The judge's ruling responded to a federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials filed Saturday by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. federal court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are being held in the District of Columbia.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Saturday night that the \"written order and the Administration's actions do not conflict,\" and said a \"single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"",
      "Wrapping up the hearing, Boasberg said he'd issue a written order quickly because \"apparently my oral orders don't seem to carry much weight\" with the Justice Department.",
      "Before the hearing, the Justice Department filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting Boasberg's removal from the case, arguing that his actions in the case have been an \"inappropriate exercise of jurisdiction\" and claiming he had followed \"highly unusual and improper procedures,\" in his hearing on Saturday evening.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

    "summary": "Among the CISA cuts were top recruits tasked with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from foreign and domestic cyber attacks.",
    "story": [
      "For Kelly Shaw, unemployment is unfamiliar territory. \"I've never been in this situation before. I've never been fired,\" Shaw said, suddenly quiet, while seated at her kitchen table in Northern Virginia.",
      "Nearly three years ago, the longtime senior intelligence analyst left the Navy, after being recruited by the nation's top cyber defense agency and rising up through the ranks. Eventually, Shaw helped establish a congressionally mandated program designed to continuously monitor and detect cyber breaches of the nation's power grid, pipelines and water system \u2013 installing sensors across critical infrastructure designed to detect insider threats and foreign adversaries like China, Russia and Iran.",
      "\"It was all about the information we can get within networks to find the bad guys \u2013 any indicators of compromise, evidence of the adversary, moving through a network and attempting to do bad things. That's what we did,\" Shaw said, pausing. \"Well, that's what some will still do.\"",
      "The former manager for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency's \"CyberSentry\" program, Shaw was also among the 130 probationary CISA workers mass fired in the \"Valentine's Day Massacre\" during the holiday weekend last month.",
      "That weekend, the form letter termination notices arrived for over 4% of CISA's workforce, telling them they were \"not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\" Among them were the nation's threat hunters, incident response team members, disabled veterans and employees who'd already signed onto the federal government's deferred resignation program.",
      "Others were former private sector workers who left lucrative jobs making seven-figure salaries to join the federal government and officials recruited into DHS' innovative hiring program \u2014 dubbed the \"Cyber Talent Management System\" \u2014 and analysts with top secret security clearances.",
      "\"I waited literally 13 months from the moment I got my offer letter to the moment I started this job,\" said former cybersecurity specialist Paula Davis, recounting her arduous security clearance process. Before her termination letter arrived in her email inbox, Davis said she was required to send agency leadership an email justifying her position, but she never received a response.",
      "Davis spent her days analyzing code for state and local municipalities, identifying risks or abnormalities across the nation's aging critical infrastructure.",
      "\"We're being targeted daily, hourly and every single minute,\" Davis said, citing suspected cybercriminals' attempts to infiltrate water systems and the power grid. She called her role fighting those intrusions her \"dream job.\"",
      "\"I didn't take an oath to the Constitution just to start getting a paycheck,\" Davis said, \"Or else I would have just gone back into the private sector. I would have stayed at a big corporation.\"",
      "Since last month, the rapid-fire firings have shaken lawmakers and high-ranking officials, leaving many current and former employees dumbfounded. CBS News has spoken with over a dozen current and former CISA employees, including several who were granted anonymity in interviews, due to fear of reprisal.",
      "\"These are the people that are the first line of defense in responding to incidents like Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon, and if we go even further back, SolarWinds,\" said one former CISA employee, referencing a string of foreign cyber espionage campaigns dating back to President Trump's first administration.",
      "\"These are elite hunters that look across critical infrastructure and government networks to figure out if these bad actors are active in these networks,\" the former employee continued. \"The people who find how deeply they've penetrated and 'how do we get them out of there?'\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned at a hearing Wednesday that lawmakers are hearing that \"significant cuts are coming for the remaining workforce\" at CISA.",
      "\"That kind of talent, you just don't find it every day,\" Thompson told CBS News. \"You have to convince many of those individuals to leave lucrative private sector employment and come and accept the public mission of securing our cyber security systems and protecting our country.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn, last month, Former CISA Director Jen Easterly wrote that the agency had hired over 2,000 new employees during her more than three-year tenure.",
      "Since 2021, CISA's \"strategic recruitment\" program \u2013 congressionally mandated and more than seven years in the making \u2013 has competed with the private sector to attract and retain world-class talent to execute a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CISA. Cyber Talent Management System or \"CTMS\" hires were by law employees with \"measurable or observable\" attributes including \"knowledge, skills, abilities and behaviors.\"",
      "A former human resources employee for CISA who was among those fired told CBS News that before his termination, he was tasked with compiling a list of probationary employees, and among them were over 100 CTMS staff members.",
      "\"Everybody in CTMS is automatically in a three-year probation, so it's easier to get rid of them,\" the former HR employee told CBS News. \"Close to 99% of our CTMS employees were probationary.\"",
      "\"You are extinguishing the best and brightest in one fell swoop,\" a current CISA employee said.",
      "A CISA spokesperson told CBS News in a statement that the agency had 142 employees as part of its talent recruitment program, but did not disclose the number of employees fired.",
      "Shaw was among the first recruits to the \"CTMS\" program, entering with 12 years of government service, two master degrees in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, plus at least nine different specialized cyber certifications.",
      "\"I had such confidence,\" Shaw said. \"With all my prior experience. I just completed my doctorate in May of last year. So I thought I was well positioned to stay at CISA\u2026.But when I saw that executive order come through about probationary employees, I kind of panicked.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration is \"making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer.\"",
      "\"To me, knowing how sleek and how well organized of an engine we had at CISA, that's a lie,\" Shaw said of the effort to slash federal spending by eliminating federal workers. \"I don't know who else is going to be cut loose from our nation's cyber defense organizations. But I'm worried about that. I'm worried about that. This should be the last place that we should be cutting this expertise.\"",
      "Along with firing scores of probationary workers, over the last month, CISA has put on leave at least a dozen employees who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections, part of a wider trend of dismantling U.S. efforts to fight foreign meddling in elections.",
      "But concerns stemming from cybersecurity workforce cuts extend beyond the CISA workforce.",
      "Former NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce raised \"grave concerns\" that aggressive threats to cuts of U.S. government probationary employees will have a \"devastating impact on the cybersecurity and our national security.\"",
      "\"At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,\" Joyce said. \"Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.\"",
      "To help assist fired employers at her former agency, Easterly has created a matching website to connect former CISA alumni and prospective employers.",
      "For his part, Thompson has started a hotline to encourage fired employees at the Department of Homeland Security and its components to share their stories.",
      "After the Trump administration tapped the Office of Personnel Management to fire federal employees en masse, a federal judge temporarily blocked it, citing OPM's lack of authority to fire employees at other agencies. This week, OPM updated its guidance to reflect that firing decisions are made by individual departments and agencies, spurring the rehiring or reinstatement of batches of fired workers in the weeks since. CISA has yet to follow suit.",
      "Asked if she'd return to the agency, Shaw paused. \"I would have to go back,\" she finally said, citing CISA's essential mission and a regular paycheck. \"I mean, they'd have to earn my trust back. But I don't know how you do that.\"",

      "The notice was sent to all \"full-time VOA employees,\" including reporters and \"all the way up to senior managers,\" a source with VOA told CBS News in a phone interview.",
      "A second source later told CBS News that VOA personal services contractors, who are also full-time, had received the same administrative email as federal employees. Contractors received termination notices on Sunday.",
      "As of Saturday, all employees could not access VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "All VOA freelancers and stringers worldwide, and those with monthly contracts or assignments, have to stop working because there is now no way to pay them, the source added.",
      "Some VOA employees were walking to their studios when they received the notice and were told \"No, go home.\"",
      "The move comes after President Trump signed an executive order late Friday that seeks to make sweeping cuts at USAGM and several other agencies, including the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Minority Business Development Agency.",
      "\"Such entities shall reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law,\" the order states.",
      "\"I am deeply saddened that for the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,\" Michael Abramowitz, director of Voice of America, said in a statement provided to CBS News Saturday. \"I learned this morning that virtually the entire staff of Voice of America\u2014more than 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff\u2014has been placed on administrative leave today. So have I.\"",
      "Abramowitz acknowledged that the agency needs \"thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard. But today's action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission. That mission is especially critical today, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.\"",
      "VOA first began broadcasting in 1942 and reaches an audience of 361 million worldwide in 49 languages and some regions that are \" deeply underrepresented.\" Prior to Saturday's action, it had a total of about 2,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $260 million.",
      "\"The American people deserve to know,\" one VOA journalist who received Saturday's notice told CBS News, adding that this is another example of the U.S. \"losing soft power\" to Russia and China.",
      "Another VOA journalist, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News: \"I always keep the best U.S. interests in mind when explaining official policies and why democracy is the best political system to foreign audiences who do not understand English.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday night temporarily blocked President Trump from removing immigrants under a wartime law known as the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u00a0after the president announced earlier in the day that he would enforce the law. Despite the ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador on Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The White House and Justice Department have said they had already been removed from the country when the judge made his ruling.",
      "The judge's ruling was in response to a federal civil lawsuit filed Saturday by a group of five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails against President Trump and other administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the 227-year-old wartime law earlier Saturday.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by attorneys with the ACLU and Democracy Forward argues the Alien Enemies Act is \"a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation's history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\"",
      "In a new filing late on Sunday, the plaintiffs in the case accused the Trump administration of violating the judge's order, alleging that the court had made it clear any planes in the air at the time the order was issued should return to the U.S. In the motion filed overnight, the plaintiffs requested \"that the Court immediately direct the government to submit one or more sworn declarations from individuals with direct knowledge of the facts clarifying\" the timing of the flights carrying the individuals to Ecuador in relation to the issuance of the court's order.",
      "Presidents are given the extraordinary power by the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act\u00a0to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the District Court for the U.S. District of Columbia, on Saturday implemented a temporary restraining order preventing their deportations for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are in the district. Four are being held in detention in Texas and one in New York. They further argued that invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is \"speculation.\"",
      "Then, following an emergency hearing Saturday evening, Boasberg expanded his order to include \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are covered by Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation, following Boasberg's decision. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "Boasberg also appeared to verbally indicate that any deportation flights that were currently in the air with migrants subject to this order on board should be returned to the U.S., although that directive was not part of his written order.",
      "Social media posts from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele indicated at least one flight carrying deported individuals had arrived in his country after the order. In one post, Bukele commented on a news story about the ruling by writing, \"Oopsie\u2026 Too late.\" That post was shared by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Communications Director Steven Cheung.",
      "The Trump administration insists it did not defy the court order. The Justice Department, which has appealed the ruling, said in a court filing that several people \"had already been removed from United States territory under the Proclamation before the issuance of this Court's second order.\" It noted that the five men covered by the first temporary restraining order had not been deported.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Sunday said, \"The Administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" also saying the order came after the deportation flight to El Salvador had left the country.",
      "The lawsuit states that Mr. Trump is \"expected to authorize immediate removal of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without any opportunity for judicial review.\"",
      "\"It also contorts the plain language of the Act: arrivals of noncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' by a 'foreign nation or government,' where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently akin to a foreign nation or government,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "As such, the government can identify any Venezuelan in the U.S. as a member of that gang, regardless of facts, and seek to deport them, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement responding to the ruling that, \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "The lawsuit further argued that the Alien Enemies Act \"has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country \u2014 Venezuela \u2014 with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who is being detained by federal immigration authorities, is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, served as a negotiator on behalf of students during Columbia University's 2024 student encampment protests. He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "Rubio said after the arrest that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "On Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"",
      "The secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"",
      "\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",
      "A top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Rubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"",
      "More broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.",
      "Asked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"",
      "\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that U.S. airstrikes in Yemen on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels are targeting the group's ability to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. military, and are \"doing the world a favor.\"",
      "\"We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump announced the strikes Saturday, saying the U.S. would use \"overwhelming lethal force\" until the Houthis cease shipping attacks. U.S. Central Command confirmed the strike in a social media post Saturday, and it's prepared to extend the campaign on the Houthis from the air and the sea for potentially weeks depending on reaction from the Houthis and Iran, a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "U.S. fighter aircraft shot down about 11 drones the Houthis launched over the course of several hours Sunday morning local time, a U.S. official said. The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S. Truman, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump in January signed an executive order re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. Mr. Trump had designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization in Jan. 2021, but former President Joe Biden removed the designation shortly afterward due to limitations it would place on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, although the Biden administration went on to label the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terror Group\" in 2024.",
      "Saturday's strikes came as the Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit in an important Red Sea transit point for global shipping for months, and the group said earlier this week that it would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza. The U.S., Israel and the United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Rubio said that while the Biden administration responded to previous attacks with retaliatory strikes, the new strikes are \"not a one-off.\"",
      "\"This is not a message,\" Rubio said. \"This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping.\"",
      "The secretary of state said that over the last 18 months, the Houthis have \"struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States,\" along with 145 attacks on commercial shipping.",
      "\"So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world,\" Rubio said. \"That's just not sustainable.\"",
      "Asked how long the campaign will last, Rubio said it will continue until the Houthis \"no longer have the capability to do that.\" He also acknowledged that he's heard no talk of ground raids so far and doesn't think there's \"a necessity for it right now.\"",
      "Rubio said as of Saturday night, \"some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us,\" adding that \"some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue.\"",
      "\"We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy,\" Rubio said. \"It's not going to happen. Not under President Trump.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the swift detention and deportation of all Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang, treating them like wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "In his proclamation, the president argued the Venezuelan gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for invoking the 227-year-old war authority.",
      "The president directed the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \"apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every\" Venezuelan migrant, 14 or older, who is deemed to be part of Tren de Aragua and who lacks U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.",
      "Those subject to the law would be eligible to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without any of the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, which include opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they would be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws.",
      "But Mr. Trump's directive was dealt an almost immediate blow on Saturday, after a federal judge agreed to block the government from deporting anyone in U.S. immigration custody subject to the president's Alien Enemies Act proclamation.",
      "At the request of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, James Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked those deportations through a 14-day temporary restraining order. Deportation flights in the air with deportees subject to Mr. Trump's decree should return to the U.S., Boasberg indicated during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Boasberg issued another order blocking the deportation of five Venezuelan migrants in immigration detention who the ACLU said were at risk of being expelled under Mr. Trump's directive.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "The Justice Department forcefully denounced the court order. \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump's proclamation was litigated in Washington, the U.S. deported more than 260 migrants to El Salvador over the weekend, including Venezuelans with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video showing some of the deportees being escorted by armed soldiers and police, having their heads shaved and marched into a prison.",
      "A senior administration official said 137 of the 261 deportees sent to El Salvador were alleged Venezuelan gang members expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 Venezuelans were deported under regular immigration law, the official said. The group, the official added, also included 21 Salvadorans accused of MS13 gang membership and two \"special cases\" that Bukele described as gang leaders wanted by El Salvador's government.",
      "In a filing on Sunday, the Justice Department said the alleged Venezuelan gang members \"had already been removed from United States territory\" under the Alien Enemies Act before the court order barring the expulsions.",
      "The White House denied it had defied the judge's order. \"The Administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.\"",
      "Leavitt added, \"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history. The law it cites, enacted 22 years after the Declaration of Independence, references invasions and incursions staged by \"any foreign nation or government.\"",
      "The centuries-old statue has been invoked only a few times in American history, including during World War I and World War II, when U.S. officials cited it to surveil and detain foreigners from Italy, Germany and Japan.",
      "But never before has the Aliens Enemies Act been invoked to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war or with the premise that a non-state actor is staging an invasion or incursion of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in his order argued Tren de Aragua is \"closely aligned\" with the repressive government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "\"(Tren de Aragua) has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime's goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",

    "story": [
      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

    "summary": "Scientists are conducting experiments to generate clean energy through fusion, the same sub-atomic reaction that powers our Sun, with the aim of constructing plants that produce more energy than they consume.",
    "story": [
      "If it looks like the set of some Hollywood sci-fi show, perhaps that's fitting, because what they are doing here is making stars on Earth. \"We are able to make miniature stars, 'cause fusion is the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars,\" said Tammy Ma, who leads the Fusion Energy Initiative at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California. It's part of the same government laboratory that ensures the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile.",
      "\"Every time we do a fusion experiment on the NIF, we are actually the hottest place in the entire solar system, hotter than the center of the Sun,\" Ma said.",
      "The scientists here are using the largest laser ever built. It's 1,000 times more powerful than the entire U.S. electrical grid, and is housed in a massive room the size of a three football fields. Here, 192 laser beams travel nearly a mile, and then focus in on a tiny target, or fuel pellet, smaller than a peppercorn. \u00a0When the lasers hit the pellet, the atoms \"fuse\" together, releasing energy in the process.",
      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",
      "But fusion is hard. After 60 years of research by scientists at NIF, they finally generated a reaction (also called \"ignition\") that produced more energy than it consumed. The breakthrough, in 2022, crucial to ever creating a fusion power plant, made headlines around the world. Humans had unlocked the power of the stars.",

      "They have achieved ignition several times since then, and now the race is on to generate enough energy to consistently power a commercial fusion plant.",
      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different. The technology is advancing as fast as the need for clean energy is rising \u2013 stars aligning in the quest to create stars here on Earth.",
      "\"This is not a paper exercise for us,\" Mumgaard said. \"We're putting this machine together, we're buying the parts, we're machining the parts, and it's all coming together at the exact time the world really needs something like this. I think that's a really cool story.\"",

      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",

      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",

Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "How did the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their ISS crewmates farewell, the returning astronauts floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the Harmony module's space-facing port early Tuesday, at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Starting at 5:11 p.m., the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "Twenty-seven minutes later, approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, the Crew Dragon reached the discernible atmosphere, enduring heat shield temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees as the spacecraft rapidly slowed in the thickening air.",
      "Nine minutes after entry, the Crew Dragon's three main parachutes unfurled for the capsule's final descent to splashdown in the Gulf.",
      "From the recovery ship, all four Crew-9 fliers were to be flown to shore by helicopter, where a NASA jet was waiting to ferry them back to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for reunions with family members and more extensive medical checks.",
      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",

By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers ruled that option out. Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",

      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

      "Stargazers who looked up at the sky last night and early this morning might have spotted the\u00a0March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\"\u00a0a total lunar eclipse that colored the moon in shades of red, orange and yellow.",
      "March's full moon is called the \"Worm Moon,\" according to the Farmer's Almanac, which has documented the history of how full moons are named. Moons that take on these reddish hues during a total lunar eclipse are called \"Blood Moons.\" The combined nicknames have resulted in some calling it the \"Blood Worm Moon.\"",
      "The moon rose in its totality early Friday, and is expected to be visible through Saturday morning, according to\u00a0NASA. Pictures captured during the event on Friday show the strangely colored lunar body large in the sky as it passed through the Earth's shadow.",
      "Pictures of last night's total lunar eclipse",
      "During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth passes directly between the moon and the sun. The alignment blocks most sunlight from reaching the moon for a brief period, though the moon remains visible during this time.",

      "Pictures of last night's \"Blood Worm Moon\"",
      "In some images from early Friday morning, the moon appears red.",
      "The reddish hues appear because some light still reaches the moon when it's fully in Earth's shadow, but those wavelengths are red, orange and yellow, NASA said. They reflect on the moon's surface and create the colorful phenomenon.",
      "When will the next total lunar eclipse take place?",
      "The next total lunar eclipse will take place on Sept. 7 and 8, according to timeanddate.com. The totality of that eclipse won't be visible in the Americas, though. Another total lunar eclipse will occur in early March 2026, and is expected to be visible in the United States.",

    "story": [
      "March's full \"Blood Worm Moon,\" a phenomenon that makes the moon appear red during a total lunar eclipse, is visible this week for Americans and others in Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The full moon reaches peak illumination at 2:55 a.m. ET on Friday, March 14. The total lunar eclipse will make the moon appear red on Thursday, March 13 into the following day, depending on the time zone, according to NASA.",
      "When and where to see the \"Blood Worm Moon\"",
      "While this month's full moon will rise early Friday, the appearance of a full moon started around Wednesday evening and will last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday at 11:57 p.m. ET. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",
      "The moon will exit from Earth's full shadow between 3:31 and 4:48 a.m., and will leave the last of the partial shadow at 6 a.m., ending lunar eclipse.",
      "Viewers in North and South America will catch the best views of the \"Blood Worm Moon,\" though parts of Europe and Africa may catch a glimpse.",
      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "This month's full moon is also called the Worm Moon. The nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomy fans are in for a treat this March as the full moon will appear to turn red during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 04:55:51 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA will wait at least another two days to launch its next space station crew, delaying the return of Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams a bit longer.",
    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

      "So, it came as a shock when he read the news that Susann Sills had suddenly died on Nov. 13, 2016, from an apparent accidental fall. \"It didn't seem plausible to me that she just fell down the stairs with a migraine headache,\" Solimine said. But that was the story Dr. Sills had told the 911 operator that morning when he called and reported finding his wife face down on the staircase. Solimine says he wondered if there was more to the story.",
      "Rick Leeds, another friend of Susann Sills, said she had left him a troubling message about a month before her death. \"She sounded like she was whispering,\" Leeds said. \"It was so different from the happy, jovial, excited voicemails I got before.

      "Smith goes inside the investigation in an encore of\u00a0\"The Puzzling Death of Susann Sills,\" airing Saturday at 10/9c* on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. (*basketball delay in the east and central time zones/)",
      "Detectives interviewed the couple's 12-year-old twins, Mary-Katherine and Eric Sills. Everyone described the marriage as \"loving.\" The children said their parents rarely fought and were never violent. And they all confirmed that Susann Sills had been suffering from a migraine all weekend. Mary-Katherine, whose room was the quietest, said she had cleaned and tidied it up to look like a hotel suite so that her mom could rest, while Mary-Katherine slept in her parents' bedroom.",
      "In his 911 call, Scott Sills said his wife's shoe had come off on the stairs, suggesting she had gotten up in the middle of the night, tripped and fell. A collection of items around Susann Sills' body seemed to support the story of an accidental fall. There was a large stainless-steel cooking pot, which seemed odd at first, but Susann Sills' family had explained she would sometimes carry a bowl when she felt nauseated. And there was an empty bottle of Tramadol, a pain medication, which Scott Sills said Susann Sills often took to treat her migraines. And off to the side was a red and white scarf. Mary-Katherine told investigators her mother had been wearing it around her neck when she was discovered in the morning. But she had taken it off so as not to impede her mother's breathing.",
      "During a preliminary examination of Susann Sills' injuries, the deputy coroner had noticed some other injuries to her neck that didn't appear to be consistent with a fall. \u00a0\"Her neck had a pretty pronounced ligature mark,\" Holloway said,",
      "Smith asked, \"Is it possible that she could have fallen down the stairs and then somehow the scarf strangled her?\"",
      "\"Could have caught on a banister ... sure, I suppose so,\" Holloway said, \"but we didn't have any evidence of that.\"",
      "Instead, investigators say, they found something suspicious. There was blood in Mary-Katherine's room where Susann Sills had been staying that night, on the curtains, the wall, and the nightstand. And they discovered that Scott Sills, who had been wearing a beanie on his head, had a cut on his head, and a bruise on his forearm. He said he had injured himself while working on his car with his son Eric. Meanwhile Eric told the detectives he'd heard his parents arguing in the early hours of the morning. Scott Sills admitted he had argued with Susann, but said it was because he was upset that she was working late on her laptop, which aggravated her migraines.",
      "Smith asked, \"When you came to the house, it was a death investigation...By the time you left, was it a murder investigation?",
      "\"No,\" said Holloway, \"It wasn't just as clear-cut as that.\"",
      "DNA tests on the blood in the bedroom eventually came back positive for Scott Sills, with a smudge on the wall that showed a mixture of both Scott and Susann's DNA. \"They were both there,\" said Holloway, \"There's a fight.\" And forensic analysis of Susann's phone suggested there was tension in the marriage. In texts sent in late August, less than three months before her death, Susann wrote, \"I am trapped\" ... \"You are killing me\" ... \"I just want out\" and \"We just aren't right for each other.\"",
      "In November 2017, a year after her death, the coroner's office cited Susann Sills' cause of death as ligature strangulation, and the manner as homicide. Dr. Sills was now the prime suspect.",
      "When investigators interviewed Scott Sills again in August 2018, he denied killing Susann Sills, and for the first time he offered an explanation for the blood in Mary-Katherine's room. He said he'd cut himself while changing a window screen.",
      "But on the day of Susann Sills' death, detectives had found something else -- a possible motive. In Scott Sills' home office was a printout of an online exchange between Susann Sills and a male member of Patrick.net dated Aug. 30, 2016. They were discussing that topless photo Susann Sills had posted. The man, who went by \"tenpoundbass\" wrote: \"All I've got to say is you must have a super cool Husband.\" Susann, aka \"turtledove\" replied, \"He's exhausted, actually. It isn't easy being married to a woman who is partially naked and posing, alluringly, all the time ...\"",
      "Scott Sills had denied printing the chat. But investigators had later found a copy of the same exchange on his phone.",
      "\"Does this sound like this could lead to motive?\" asked Smith.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Holloway. \"If it's ... something that's building up in him, some kind of anger ... or jealousy about ... what his wife's doing online without him.\"",
      "\"Enough to kill her?\" asked Smith. \"Mm-hmm,\" Holloway replied.",
      "In April 2019, Dr. Scott Sills was arrested on his way to surgery and charged with the alleged murder of his wife.",
      "At his trial in late 2023, Sills' defense attorney Jack Earley argued there was no motive for murder. And that topless photo? He told Smith, \"It wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "\"It's not striking to you that he had this photo in two places on his phone and then on the printer?\" she asked. \"No,\" he said. \"First of all, I don't know really who printed this stuff up.\"",
      "And Earley offered a unique theory to explain how the forensic pathologist could have found ligature strangulation. He said one or both of the family's dogs had tugged on the scarf that was wrapped around Susann's neck after she fell on the stairs.",
      "\"Mary-Kate ... saw the dogs pulling on the scarf,\" Earley told Smith.",
      "\"Do you honestly think that the dogs pulled hard enough to strangle her to death?\" Smith asked.",
      "\"No,\" he said. \"That was not the main theory.\"",
      "Instead, Earley focused on another injury identified in Susann's autopsy: a fractured C3 vertebra near the base of the neck, which can be fatal, or at least have left Susann incapacitated.",
      "\"Their breathing is compromised,\" Earley explained. \"If they're then choked, it doesn't take much to kill 'em.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve famously hates to surprise financial markets. That's why Wall Street forecasters overwhelmingly expect the U.S. central bank to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged when the Fed announces its latest policy statement today at 2 p.m. EST.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly signaled of late that policymakers are in no hurry to lower borrowing costs\u00a0for consumers and business. His bigger challenge: How to provide a measure of certainty on the direction of monetary policy as investors try to peer through the fog of uncertainty enveloping the global economy.",
      "Stocks edged up in morning trade ahead of the Fed's decision, with the S&P 500 rising 39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,653, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5% and 1%, respectively.",
      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners. The barrage of tariffs President Trump has aimed at Canada, China, Mexico, Europe and other countries has yet to make a deep mark on the U.S. economy, but experts warn the trade measures could drive up inflation and slam growth \u2014 a toxic stew known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "Despite signs that the economy is weakening, most Wall Street economists don't expect a recession anytime soon. And in spite of market turbulence caused by Mr. Trump's tariff threats, some experts think stocks are likely to gain strength in the months to come, although not without periodic bouts of volatility.",
      "\"We continue to expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of the year supported by Fed easing, healthy economic and profit growth, as well as AI spending and adoption,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email on Wednesday. \"Investors should consider buying the dip in quality AI stocks, and utilize structured strategies to manage downside risks in their equity exposure.\"",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report ahead of the Fed meeting that \"markets may have recently become overly pessimistic.\" Although he doesn't expect a recession, he forecasts slower economic growth and described the economy as \"vulnerable.\"",
      "The impact of tariffs and the health of the economy will, of course, help shape the Fed's decision on interest rates, and for policymakers the task amounts to threading the needle. Easing borrowing costs sooner rather than later would shore up growth, but also boost inflation \u2014 anathema to consumers worn down by nearly three years of high prices. By contrast, waiting too long to cut rates could cause the economy to stall.",
      "Investors now think there's a good chance the Fed will lower the federal funds rate three times this year, or a total of three-quarters of a percentage point, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.",

Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",

    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination files release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents, totaling some 80,000 pages, had been released before, with sections redacted for national security purposes. The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on an initial review by CBS News. But the unveiling of key portions of the records was cheered by researchers and academics who had long argued that the details in certain reports by the CIA and FBI should have been disclosed years ago.",
      "\"This is the most positive news on the release of JFK files since the 1990s,\" said Jefferson Morley, an investigative journalist and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, which hosts a repository of JFK-related documents. He called the release an \"encouraging start\" while noting that other troves of documents still remain under wraps.",
      "The records were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of files related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "The records are unredacted versions of documents that have been released in redacted form in the past. Agencies like the CIA and FBI have argued over the years that the release of the information would harm national security, even decades after the fact.",
      "According to Morley, roughly 3,500 documents in the government's official collection of JFK files contained redactions before the latest release. There were 1,123 documents of varying lengths unveiled Tuesday, meaning about a third of the remaining redacted documents have been released in full. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 IRS records have been withheld from public release entirely.",
      "\"These new records shed new light on the events leading to JFK's assassination, including his mistrust of the CIA, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and propaganda operations involving Oswald before and after JFK was killed,\" Morley said in a statement referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. Oswald sought a visa to return to the Soviet Union in October 1963 while in Mexico City, and technical details of the CIA's surveillance operations were revealed for the first time in Tuesday's release.",
      "Another notable document released in full for the first time is a\u00a0memo prepared by Kennedy adviser Arthur Schlesinger Jr. about a potential reorganization of the CIA after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The\u00a0previously redacted\u00a0section details the number of CIA personnel stationed undercover overseas, with Schlesinger expressing concern that covert CIA activities were encroaching on the State Department.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had\u00a0discovered\u00a0roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action. Those records did not appear in Tuesday's release, according to Morley.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. The IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination, a fact that the CIA withheld from the Warren Commission. Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and the documents released Tuesday detail some technical aspects of the CIA's surveillance of Oswald and Cuban and Soviet officials.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes ruled in favor of transgender active-duty service members and transgender people in the process of enlisting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a new Defense Department policy barring transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by transgender active-duty service members and transgender people who are in the process of enlisting. The judge's order temporarily blocks Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the military services from implementing President Trump's executive order and additional guidance that prohibits transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "But the judge put her order on hold until March 21 to give the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, issued her decision after holding several hours of hearings earlier this month, during which she sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about the Defense Department's justifications for the ban.",
      "\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in her 79-page decision, later adding, \"The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple.\u00a0 In the self-evident truth that 'all people are created equal,' all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\"",
      "Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights for GLAD Law, one of the lead attorneys in the case, called the ruling \"decisive\" and said it \"speaks volumes.\"",
      "\"The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal,\" Levi said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department called the ruling \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people, who decisively voted to elect President Trump.\"",
      "The policy arose out of an executive order Mr. Trump issued in late January that directed Hegseth to implement a policy for transgender service members based on troop readiness. The order stated that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "The executive order also\u00a0revoked a measure implemented in January 2021 by then-President Joe Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive, Hegseth issued a memorandum in early February that halted recruitment of new service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria and paused gender-affirming care for transgender troops. The Pentagon then said in a late February document that the U.S. would begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "The memo said that individuals with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \"are no longer eligible for military service.\" It also said that pronoun usage when referring to a service member must reflect his or her sex and barred the use of Pentagon funds for gender-affirming care.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a January report from the Congressional Research Service. While a Justice Department lawyer told the court earlier this month that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a February 26 memo from the Pentagon.",
      "The lawsuit before Reyes was filed in late January by a group of more than a dozen transgender active-duty service members, one person enlisted in U.S. Army basic training and five transgender people who were in the process of enlisting. They argued that the ban was unconstitutional and sought a court order blocking its enforcement.",
      "In her decision, Reyes found that the challengers were likely to succeed on their claim that the ban fails a higher level of judicial scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and transgender status. The judge also held that the Trump administration's policy is likely driven by unconstitutional animus.",
      "\"The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" she wrote. \"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\"",
      "Reyes wrote that Mr. Trump and the Defense Department \"could have crafted a policy that balances the nation's need for a prepared military and Americans' right to equal protection. They still can. The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"",
      "The judge said government's policy is \"overbroad\" and also includes \"derogatory generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons.\" Such generalizations, Reyes wrote, \"do not suffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness and unit cohesion.\"",
      "The decision from Reyes is likely to be appealed by the Justice Department, but it is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration, since several of its policies have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. A second challenge to the Mr. Trump's military ban is currently underway in Washington state.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, in 2017, but an initial Pentagon policy was blocked by federal courts. The plan was then revised in 2018, and it took effect the following year and remained in place until the start of the Biden administration.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 09:14:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Here are the latest updates on what's known about Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.",
    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing in early March during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe faces questioning, says he is cooperating",
      "Riibe has been in Punta Cana for questioning since the investigation got underway. He was confined to a hotel for more than a week, with officers escorting him anywhere he went, but a judge in the Dominican Republic ruled March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities confiscated Riibe's passport as he faced questioning, including direct interrogation by Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso. The judge's ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, and when he would be able to travel back to the U.S. remained unclear.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

      "Worrying test results",
      "The development came as Consumer Reports shared results\u00a0on Tuesday of tests by the group that found found potentially harmful chemicals in roughly half of 41 infant formula products, including acrylamide, arsenic, BPA, lead and PFAS. The remaining products were found to have low levels of, or no, concerning chemicals.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's ties to the Trump administration have provoked protests and violent attacks on Tesla across the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla, whose pioneering electric vehicles were once a symbol of forward-thinking sustainability, increasingly finds itself the target of public furor.",
      "Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.",
      "There has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.",
      "\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They're rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.",
      "String of attacks",
      "The attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.",
      "And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.",
      "\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.",
      "A number of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.",
      "An Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building's front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some Tesla owners in conservative-leaning states are also facing acts of vandalism, including one Texas man whose Tesla was recently keyed while parked at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.",
      "\"I just bought it because it was an electric car,\" Dallas resident Jeff Nguyen told CBS News Texas. \"This one is pretty fun to drive. It has really just nothing to do with politics or anything like that.\"",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn't have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Mr. Trump's adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump's election but has since shed all those gains and this year has tumbled 44%, prompting expressions of concern from Wall Street analysts. Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.",
      "President Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"",
      "\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \"Musk Or Us\" protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \"it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\"",
      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle's new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \"I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\" or \"I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\"",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla's most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "\"We're coming after you\"",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Mr. Trump's political interests. Mr. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \"domestic terror,\" and he has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \"going to go through hell.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she'd opened an investigation \"to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\"",
      "\"If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\" Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"",
      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\"It's not the type of act that I would prioritize,\" Clarke said. \"Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\"",
      "Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.",
      "\"Hate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that's fine and dandy, it's your choice,\" she said. \"It doesn't justify ruining somebody's property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There's other ways to get your voice heard that's more effective.\"",
      "Someone recently slapped a \"no Elon\" sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn't intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",
      "\"I love my car. It's the safest car,\" Ramsdell said. \"I'm not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\"",

    "summary": "Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, was put to death Tuesday evening in Louisiana's first execution in 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "Louisiana used\u00a0nitrogen gas to put Jessie Hoffman Jr., 46, to death Tuesday evening in the state's first execution in 15 years. Nitrogen gas has been used just four other times to execute a person in the United States \u2014 all in Alabama, the only other state with a protocol for the method.",
      "\"It is unfortunate that bad people exist, and they do real bad things. When these acts of violence happen, society must not tolerate it,\" Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement following the execution, adding, \"If you commit heinous acts of violence in this State, it will cost you your life. Plain and simple.",
      "Hoffman declined to give a final statement before the gas began flowing and he subsequently was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Authorities said the nitrogen gas flowed for 19 minutes during what one official called a \"flawless\" execution, although one witness spoke of the inmate convulsing during the process.",
      "Hoffman's attorneys had sought to halt the execution, saying in a series of court filings leading up to his death the method is unconstitutional, violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. They also said it infringes on Hoffman's freedom to practice religion, specifically his Buddhist breathing and meditation in the moments leading up to his death.",
      "Louisiana officials maintain that the method is painless and say it is past time for the state to deliver justice promised to victims' families after a decade-and-a-half hiatus. Attorney General Liz Murrill says that she expects at least four people on Louisiana's death row to be executed this year.",
      "On Monday, Hoffman's attorneys filed a slew of additional challenges in state and federal courts as a last-ditch effort to stop the execution. The 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard \"Chip\" Moore considered one of the challenges at a hearing Tuesday morning, which involved the question of whether the execution as planned violated Hoffman's religious freedom under the Preservation of Religious Freedom Act. But the state judge in Baton Rouge ultimately declined to the halt the impending procedure, CBS News affiliate\u00a0WAFB reported.",
      "The judge on Monday had issued a temporary restraining order \u2014 preventing the state from executing Hoffman \u2014 pending the Tuesday morning hearing. The restraining order was to expire at 9:30 a.m., with the execution scheduled to take place hours later on Tuesday evening.",
      "After court battles earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily halted Hoffman's execution by nitrogen gas last week, issuing a preliminary injunction to stop the state from immediately carrying out his death sentence. An appeals court quickly reversed that injunction, and in the wake of Tuesday's hearing, Hoffman's attorneys had just one final appeal out to the United States Supreme Court to halt the execution. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that effort on Tuesday, declining to intervene by a 5-4 vote, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hoffman was convicted of the 1996 murder of Mary \"Molly\" Elliott, a 28-year-old advertising executive, in New Orleans.",
      "Under the Louisiana protocol, which is nearly identical to Alabama's, officials had earlier said Hoffman would be strapped to a gurney before a full-face respirator mask fitted tightly on him. Pure nitrogen gas was then pumped into the mask, forcing him to breathe it in and depriving him of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.",
      "The protocol called for the gas to be administered for at least 15 minutes or five minutes after the inmate's heart rate reaches a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer.",
      "Each inmate put to death using nitrogen in Alabama had appeared to shake and gasp to varying degrees during their executions, according to media witnesses, including an Associated Press reporter. The reactions are involuntary movements associated with oxygen deprivation, state officials have said.",
      "Currently, four states \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma \u2014 specifically authorize execution by nitrogen hypoxia, according to records compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Alabama first used the lethal gas to put Kenneth Eugene Smith to death last year, marking the first time a new method had been used in the U.S. since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.",
      "In an effort to resume executions, Louisiana's GOP-dominated Legislature expanded the state's approved death penalty methods last year to include nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution. Lethal injection was already in place.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, a small group of execution opponents held a vigil outside the rural southeast Louisiana prison at Angola, where the state's executions are carried out. Some passed out prayer cards with photos of a smiling Hoffman and planned a Buddhist reading and \"Meditation for Peace.",
      "Over recent decades, the number of executions nationally has declined sharply amid legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs and waning public support for capital punishment. That has led a majority of states to either abolish or pause carrying out the death penalty.",

    "summary": "With the first licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms issued in Colorado, excitement and questions build about the fungi's potential, affordability and safety.",
    "story": [
      "Colorado regulators are issuing licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms and are planning to authorize the state's first \"healing centers,\" where the mushrooms can be ingested under supervision, in late spring or early summer.",
      "The dawn of state-regulated psychedelic mushrooms has arrived in Colorado, nearly two years since Oregon began offering them. The mushrooms are a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law except for clinical research. But more than a dozen cities nationwide have deprioritized or decriminalized them in the past five years, and many eyes are turned toward Oregon's and Colorado's state-regulated programs.",
      "\"In Oregon and Colorado, we're going to learn a lot about administration of psychedelics outside of clinical, religious, and underground settings because they're the first to try this in the U.S.,\" said William R. Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.",
      "Psychedelic mushrooms and their psychoactive compound psilocybin have the potential to\u00a0treat people with depression and anxiety, including those unresponsive to other medications or therapy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, says the risk of mental health problems caused by ingesting mushrooms in a supervised clinical setting is low, but may be higher outside of a clinical setting. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media post last year, before his nomination as U.S. health secretary, that his \"mind is open to the idea of psychedelics for treatment.\"",
      "Medical experts say more research is needed, particularly in people with a diagnosis or family history of psychotic or bipolar disorder. Adverse effects of psilocybin, including headache and nausea, typically resolve within one to two days. However, extended difficulties from using psychedelics can last weeks, months, or years; anxiety and fear, existential struggle, social disconnection, and feeling detached from oneself and one's surroundings are most common. After the decriminalization and legalization in Oregon and Colorado, psychedelic mushroom exposures reported to poison control centers ticked up in these states and nationally.",
      "In February, about 40 people organized by the psychedelic advocacy group the Nowak Society gathered in Boulder to talk about the coming changes in Colorado. They included Mandy Grace, who received her state license to administer psychedelic mushrooms, and Amanda Clark, a licensed mental health counselor from Denver, who both praised the therapeutic power of mushrooms.",
      "\"You get discouraged in your practice because the current therapies are not enough for people,\" Clark said.",
      "Colorado voters approved Proposition 122 in 2022 to\u00a0legalize natural psychedelics, after Oregon voters in 2020 approved legalizing psilocybin for therapeutic use. Colorado's program is modeled after, but not the same as, Oregon's, under which 21,246 psilocybin products have been sold as of March, a total that could include secondary doses, according to the Oregon Health Authority.",
      "As of mid-March, Colorado has received applications for at least 15 healing center licenses, nine cultivation licenses, four manufacturer licenses, and one testing facility license for growing and preparing the mushrooms, under rules developed over two years by the governor-appointed Natural Medicine Advisory Board.",
      "Psychedelic treatments in Oregon are expensive, and are likely to be so in Colorado, too, said Tasia Poinsatte, Colorado director of the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, which supports state-regulated programs for psychedelic therapy. In Oregon, psychedelic mushroom sessions are typically $1,000 to $3,000, are not covered by insurance, and must be paid for up front.",
      "The mushrooms themselves are not expensive, Poinsatte said, but a facilitator's time and support services are costly, and there are state fees. In Colorado, for doses over 2 milligrams, facilitators will screen participants at least 24 hours in advance, then supervise the session in which the participant consumes and experiences mushrooms, lasting several hours, plus a later meeting to integrate the experience.",
      "Facilitators, who may not have experience with mental health emergencies, need training in screening, informed consent, and postsession monitoring, Smith said. \"Because these models are new, we need to gather data from Colorado and Oregon to ensure safety.\"",
      "Facilitators generally pay a $420 training fee, which allows them to pursue the necessary consultation hours, and roughly $900 a year for a license, and healing centers pay $3,000 to $6,000 for initial licenses in Colorado. But the up-front cost for facilitators is significant: The required 150 hours in a state-accredited program and 80 hours of hands-on training can cost $10,000 or more, and Clark said she wouldn't pursue a facilitator license due to the prohibitive time and cost.",
      "To increase affordability for patients in Colorado, Poinsatte said, healing centers plan to offer sliding-scale pay options, and discounts for veterans, Medicaid enrollees, and those with low incomes. Group sessions are another option to lower costs.",
      "Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state. But it allows adults 21 and older to grow, use, and share psychedelic mushrooms for personal use.",
      "Despite the retail ban, adjacent businesses have mushroomed. Inside the warehouse and laboratory of Activated Brands in Arvada, brown bags of sterilized grains such as corn, millet, and sorghum and plastic bags of soil substrate are for sale, along with genetic materials and ready-to-grow kits.",
      "Co-founder Sean Winfield sells these supplies for growing psychedelic or functional mushrooms such as lion's mane to people hoping to grow their own at home. Soon, Activated Brands will host cultivation and education classes for the public, Winfield said.",
      "Winfield and co-founder Shawn Cox recently hosted a psychedelic potluck at which experts studying and cultivating psychedelic mushrooms discussed genetics, extraction, and specialized equipment.",
      "Psychedelic mushrooms have a long history in Indigenous cultures, and provisions for their use in spiritual, cultural, or religious ceremonies are included in Colorado law, along with recognition of the cultural harm that could occur to federally recognized tribes and Indigenous people if natural medicine is overly commercialized or exploited.",
      "Several studies over the past five years have shown the long-term benefits of psilocybin for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and the Food and Drug Administration designated it a breakthrough therapy. Late-stage trials, often a precursor to application for FDA approval, are underway.",
      "Smith said psilocybin is a promising tool for treating mental health disorders but has not yet been shown to be better than other advanced treatments. Joshua Woolley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California-San Francisco, said he has seen the benefits of psilocybin as an investigator in clinical trials.",
      "\"People can change hard-set habits. They can become unstuck. They can see things in new ways,\" he said of treating patients with a combination of psilocybin and psychotherapy.",
      "Colorado, unlike Oregon, allows integration of psilocybin into existing mental health and medical practices with a clinical facilitator license, and through micro-healing centers that are more limited in the amounts of mushrooms they can store.",
      "Still, Woolley said, between the federal ban and new state laws for psychedelics, this is uncharted territory. Most drugs used to treat mental health disorders are regulated by the FDA, something that Colorado is \"taking into its own hands\" by setting up its own program to regulate manufacturing and administration of psilocybin.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado declined to comment on its policy toward state-regulated psychedelic programs or personal use provisions, but Poinsatte hopes the same federal hands-off approach to marijuana will be taken for psilocybin in Oregon and Colorado.",
      "Winfield said he looks forward to the upcoming rollout and potential addition of other plant psychedelics, such as mescaline. \"We're talking about clandestine industries coming into the light,\" he said.",

      "At around 2:45 a.m. local time, officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department responded to multiple reports of Tesla vehicles being set on fire at a Tesla Collision Center. Police found at least five Tesla vehicles damaged, including two which were engulfed in flames, and the word \"RESIST\" in capital letters spray painted in red on the center's doors.",
      "The suspect also fired at least three rounds into the vehicles and is believed to have used Molotov cocktails for the fire, according to police.",
      "Investigators are still searching for the suspect and said the individual approached the Tesla facility wearing black clothing. The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating alongside the Las Vegas police.",
      "The Las Vegas incident follows a string of protests and violence at Tesla facilities nationwide over Tesla CEO Elon Musk's role in President Trump's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Other incidents have included graffiti on a Tesla dealership sign, Molotov cocktails thrown in another dealership's lot, and Tesla charging stations set on fire.",

    "summary": "Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were tapped by the treasury secretary to lead reform efforts at the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has promoted two agents with the Internal Revenue Service who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about political interference into their investigation of Hunter Biden's tax crimes.",
      "IRS special agents Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were assigned to Bessent's office as senior advisers for IRS reform, and Shapley was named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",
      "The promotions stand in stark contrast to President Trump's decision on Monday to revoke Secret Service protections for Hunter Biden, despite an executive order signed by his father, former President Joe Biden, extending those protections through July.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler first came forward in 2023, alleging the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father. They were removed from the case \u2014 and temporarily sidelined with pay.",
      "The duo's disclosures came ahead of a series of court decisions that ultimately led President Biden to pardon his son for the crimes related to the agents' investigation. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to those crimes after a Delaware judge rejected a plea deal that would have given him broad immunity.",
      "\"We have been motivated by one singular mantra: do what's right,\" Shapley said in a statement. \"It's never been easy, and there have been more pitfalls than one would hope, but we appreciate the opportunity Secretary Bessent is giving us to utilize our skills and firsthand knowledge of the agency to further the work of the administration to root out waste and fraud from the federal government and make a difference.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Bessent said he is giving Shapley and Ziegler \"a year to investigate the wrongdoing that's going on at the IRS,\" adding that they will make sure \"this Hunter Biden nonsense\" doesn't repeat itself.",
      "The new assignments come as the IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through layoffs, attrition and buyouts, part of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government. And the prominent postings are an abrupt departure from the tenuous relationship the two IRS whistleblowers previously had with the tax agency.",
      "In December, the federal watchdog that investigates whistleblower complaints substantiated claims by Shapley and Ziegler alleging the IRS had retaliated against them when agency leadership had removed the two agents from the Hunter Biden case at DOJ's request.",
      "The retaliation claim was part of an effort by Shapley and Ziegler to push back against what they believed was a wide-ranging effort by Hunter Biden's attorneys to discredit them. In September, the two men sued Abbe Lowell \u2013 one of Hunter Biden's attorneys \u2013 for defamation. Lowell responded by strenuously disputing the allegations and calling Shapley and Ziegler \"disgruntled.\"",
      "As for Hunter Biden, he recently was granted approval by a California judge to drop a lawsuit he filed against a former Trump White House aide he accused of illegally publishing private photos, emails, and other materials from his now-infamous laptop.",
      "In court documents, Hunter Biden cited financial reasons for dropping the lawsuit. He said his \"income has decreased significantly\" as sales of his art have dried up in the past year, and he was forced out of the house he was renting due to the fires that ravaged Los Angeles in January.",

    "story": [
      "Two long-delayed Starliner astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Tuesday, finally closing out a repeatedly extended 286-day odyssey in space. They shared the ride home with two outgoing space station crewmates, Crew-9 commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Seventeen hours after undocking from the International Space Station, the Crew Dragon settled to a gentle, on-target splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast near Tallahassee at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "\"Splashdown! Good mains release,\" Hague radioed SpaceX flight controllers in Hawthorne, California, after the four main parachutes were released from the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Copy, splashdown,\" a SpaceX engineer replied. \"We see main chutes cut. Nick, Alex, Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home.\"",
      "\"What a ride,\" Hague said. \"I see a capsule full of grins, ear to ear.\"\ufeff",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship was stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew could be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks. The side hatch was opened at 6:38 p.m. EDT and the crew began to emerge into the fresh air and sunshine about 10 minutes later. Williams and Wilmore were the last ones out.",
      "For the two Starliner astronauts, it closed out a marathon mission that was originally supposed to last about eight days but stretched to nine-and-a-half months, covering 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles since launch last June 5 aboard a problem-plagued Boeing capsule. Their flight ranks sixth on the list of longest single NASA missions.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov spent 171 days in orbit since their launch last September aboard the Crew 9 ferry ship.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day in orbit exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "How did the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their ISS crewmates farewell, the returning astronauts floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the Harmony module's space-facing port early Tuesday, at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Starting at 5:11 p.m., the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "Twenty-seven minutes later, approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, the Crew Dragon reached the discernible atmosphere, enduring heat shield temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees as the spacecraft rapidly slowed in the thickening air.",
      "Nine minutes after entry, the Crew Dragon's three main parachutes unfurled for the capsule's final descent to splashdown in the Gulf.",
      "From the recovery ship, all four Crew-9 fliers were to be flown to shore by helicopter, where a NASA jet was waiting to ferry them back to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for reunions with family members and more extensive medical checks.",
      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The chief justice's statement came after President Trump called for a federal judge to be impeached.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday defending federal judges who have issued decisions against the Trump administration, saying that \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement\" with a court's decision.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement distributed by the Supreme Court's public information office. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts' statement comes after President Trump attacked a federal district judge on Truth Social and called for his impeachment. The judge, James Boasberg, temporarily\u00a0blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from using the wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport noncitizens.",
      "Boasberg had issued an oral order from the bench requiring planes carrying 261 people that were on their way to Central America to return to the U.S. The Trump administration had alleged that 137 of the people on board the planes had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite Boasberg's order, two planes landed in El Salvador, sparking allegations that the Trump administration had defied a court order.",
      "\"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn't WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn't WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn't WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Mr. Trump wrote in his post.",
      "The president added that Boasberg and \"many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before\" should be \"IMPEACHED!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's targeting of Boasberg, who was appointed to the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., by President Barack Obama, is an escalation in the ongoing attacks on federal judges who have been overseeing the dozens of challenges to the president's policies. Some of those judges have ordered the Trump administration to put its plans on hold while legal proceedings move forward, sparking condemnations from the president's allies and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department has appealed many of those rulings and sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court\u00a0in three court fights\u00a0so far.",
      "Federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed from the bench if they are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. Just 15 judges have been impeached in U.S. history, most recently in 2010. Eight of those 15 have been convicted and removed from office.",
      "Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president, has taken to social media repeatedly to call on the judges to be impeached, claiming they are \"evil.\"",
      "In a\u00a0post last month on X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges.\" In\u00a0another post, he wrote that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also\u00a0introduced impeachment resolutions\u00a0against at least three judges because of rulings they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "In response to the attacks on members of the judiciary, two Republican-appointed judges warned last week that they strike at judicial independence.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" Judge Richard Sullivan, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, said during a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Judge Jeffrey Sutton, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, said it's a \"shame\" to see judges attacked simply for doing their jobs.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" he said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before, namely in his year-end report issued to close out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "Roberts is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the judiciary. Such statements from the chief justice are rare, but it is not the first time Roberts has pushed back against Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "In 2018, after the president complained about a federal judge who ruled against an asylum policy during his first term and referred to him as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts said the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:36:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Some information demanded by a judge about flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members is likely to remain private, the Justice Department said.",
    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration over use of a war authority to deport alleged gang members warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "The lawyers for Venezuelan migrants suing the government said Tuesday in an appellate court filing: \"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"",
      "Those subject to the 1798 Alien Enemies Act can be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday, and used it to send two planes carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "In a hearing Saturday, D.C. U.S. Chief District Judge James Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate Justice Department appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer provided new details about the Trump administration's deportation flights of alleged gang members, but continued to argue the government had a right to reject a judge's order directing the planes to return to the U.S., even if they were already in the air.",
      "According to a sworn declaration by Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of ICE's enforcement and removal operations, the two planes \"departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 p.m.\" on Saturday \u2014 40 minutes after D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be returned to the U.S. during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "The government reiterated Tuesday that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration had also argued in a hearing on Monday that Boasberg did not have authority to redirect the planes because the judge had not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing. The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "Cerna said the government's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to justify the removal of alleged Tren de Aragua members was signed Friday evening, a day before the flights were publicly announced on Saturday by the White House.",
      "His testimony is part of a court-mandated series of responses to Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday. The rest of the answers Boasberg requested are likely to remain private because of \"operational issues,\" a Justice Department attorney told the court, declining to provide the court with this information publicly.",
      "Those details are likely to include whether additional planes have left the U.S. with alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Cerna's sworn testimony did not provide all of this information, though he noted that 54 members of Tren de Aragua are in detention in the U.S., and approximately 172 are on the non-detained docket, which means they are not being detained by the government as their immigration proceedings continue. There are also approximately 32 are in criminal custody who have active detainers \u2014 that is, ICE has asked that they be held for up to 48 hours after they're scheduled to be released.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-do-economists-identify-recession-stagflation/",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:13:23 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's how economists identify a recession, and where the U.S. economy currently stands amid market turmoil caused by tariff threats.",
    "story": [
      "As tariff uncertainty continues to\u00a0roil the stock market, some economists believe the U.S. could be headed toward a recession, a possibility that even the Trump administration has declined to rule out.\u00a0But how close are we to a recession, and how will we know when we're in one?",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, to determine a business cycle is recessionary.",
      "\"There's no one agreed-upon definition of a recession, but the most commonly used metric is two back-to-back periods of negative economic growth,\" said CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. \"That would mean that we would see negative growth in U.S. gross domestic product or GDP, over two consecutive quarters.\"",
      "Notably, a financial quarter's growth measure only becomes clear after it's concluded, \"so we wouldn't officially know we're in a recession until we were already in it,\" O'Grady said.",
      "Recessions are generally marked by rising unemployment and a significant decline in economic activity across sectors as consumers cut back on spending and businesses put a freeze on hiring. Since 1929, there have been 14 recessionary periods in the U.S. Most recently, the U.S. economy entered a brief, two-month long recession from February to April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Although U.S. unemployment ticked up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, it remains low by historical standards. Employers added 151,000 jobs in February, a sign that businesses are still looking to hire.\u00a0Retail sales rose in February, albeit less than expected.",
      "For now, the warning signs aren't yet flashing red, economists say.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Another possibility: stagflation",
      "Still, some economists are warning of another, potentially worse outcome for the U.S. economy: stagflation. That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

    "story": [
      "Investors are bailing out of U.S. stocks \u2014 big time.",
      "A new survey from Bank of America shows that global fund managers are moving out of domestic companies in what analysts at the financial giant describe as the \"biggest drop in U.S. equity allocation ever.\" The reason: growing pessimism about the country's economic outlook as the Trump administration beats the drum for a trade war with Canada, Mexico, China and other countries.",
      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in the monthly report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes were back in the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 60 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,615, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 260 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 305 points, or 1.7%.",
      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes. Over the first three months of 2025, the country's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 1.2%, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.",
      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",
      "And despite the market turbulence, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst with eToro, notes that nine of 11 S&P sectors remain in positive territory in 2025. The two sectors that have sunk \u2014 technology and consumer discretionary \u2014 have fallen 7% and nearly 12%, respectively.",
      "\"Because investors' favorite stocks (and those with a heavy weighting in the index) have suffered so much, it's likely impacting investor sentiment disproportionately vs. an otherwise more orderly decline,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Historically, similar levels in sentiment have coincided with at least a short-term bottom in U.S. stocks, although it's not clear that we've seen a capitulatory type move that generally marks the bottom.\"",

      "The Trump administration provided a detailed accounting\u00a0of the number of probationary employees, generally considered those who were in their jobs for less than one year, who were targeted in the president's drastic plans to scale back the federal workforce in court filings Monday. The information was submitted as part of the administration's compliance with a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge James Bredar last week.",
      "Justice Department lawyers provided declarations from human resources officials at 18 different agencies who were covered by Bredar's order, which detailed the number of probationary workers who were fired last month and then had to be reinstated to their roles.",
      "Bredar, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, temporarily blocked the mass firings of probationary workers and ordered them to be reinstated. He is the second judge to order the Trump administration to rehire fired federal workers.",
      "The Justice Department has appealed both decisions. But on Monday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put one of the orders, from a federal district judge in California, on hold while proceedings move forward.",
      "In their declarations, the human resources officials across the federal government said they were working to comply with Bredar's order. But they all warned that reinstating removed employees would cause \"significant confusion\" and turmoil for those workers. The officers also noted that an appeals court could reverse the district court's order, subjecting affected employees to multiple changes in their employment status in just a few weeks.",
      "Most of the employees who were rehired were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits, the human resources officials said. In a separate filing in a case challenging the mass firings brought in California, Justice Department lawyers said that the administrative leave placement is \"a first part of a series of steps to reinstate probationary employees\" and an \"intermediate measure taken by a number of the agencies in order to return probationary employees to full duty status.\" The judge in that case last week ordered the Trump administration to reinstate fired probationary workers at six agencies.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

      "Amazon is suing the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission over the government agency's order requiring the online retailer to recall hundreds of thousands of potentially hazardous products sold by other sellers on its platform.",
      "The commission in July 2024 ruled that Amazon was distributing products that are defective or fail to meet federal safety standards. The CPSC also said Amazon was legally responsible for the recall of more than 400,000 products, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hairdryers without electrocution protection and children's sleepwear that violates federal flammability standards.",
      "The CPSC ruling and order came three years after it authorized an administrative complaint against Amazon that alleged it distributed certain products that could pose a danger to consumers. Amazon said its lawsuit comes in response to a final order filed by the CPSC on January 17.",
      "During the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties. The company reiterated that stance in a lawsuit filed late last week, describing itself as a logistics provider rather than a distributor.",
      "\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.",
      "Amazon also alleges that the CPSC's structure is unconstitutional because it lets commissioners \"act as judge, jury and prosecutor in the same proceeding.\"",
      "Amazon declined to comment on its litigation, but a spokesperson said that the company had notified customers that they should stop using products flagged by the CPSC for recall and refunded them. Amazon launched a product recall\u00a0page\u00a0in 2023.",

      "Consumer Reports blasts Amazon",

      "\"What's even worse is that the company is attacking the legal foundation on which the CPSC rests,\" he added. \"Amazon's suit suggests the company thinks the people of the United States would be better off without an independent, bipartisan safety agency to enforce our laws and protect consumers from dangerous products.\"",

      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The student, 20, was last seen in the early morning hours of March 6\u00a0on a beach near the resort town's Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel where she and her friends and had been staying. Surveillance video from the night she disappeared showed Konanki walking toward the beach with a group of three women and two men, one of whom authorities identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, who is presumed to be the last person to see her alive. She and Riibe stayed behind on the beach after the four others left, a police source told CBS News, citing video footage.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and struggled in rough waters. He said he believed Konanki made it out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "Konanki lives in the D.C. suburb Loudon, Virginia, and attends the University of Pittsburgh. Her disappearance sparked a missing persons investigation and massive search effort by authorities in the Dominican Republic and the United States, with agencies probing land, sea and air in hopes of locating her. The Dominican Republic National Police said they created a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, while Interpol issued a missing person alert to police around the world.",
      "Authorities in the U.S. and the Dominican Republic have repeatedly emphasized that this is so far not a criminal investigation. Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said investigators are exploring whether Konanki may have drowned but have not ruled out the possibility of foul play. In their request that law enforcement declare her dead, Konanki's family referenced the lack of evidence suggesting foul play so far.",
      "Since Konanki vanished, Reynoso has directly interrogated Riibe, a student at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is originally from Iowa, the law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, told CBS News. Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport while holding him for questioning in Punta Cana and assigning him \"permanent\" police escorts, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said.",
      "Riibe's attorney has been pushing for his release, noting in legal filings that his client has not been charged with a crime, local media reported. A hearing on that issue was set for later Tuesday.",
      "Chapman described Riibe as \"very forthcoming\" in interviews with two of the sheriff's detectives who traveled to Punta Cana last week to discuss the case with him. In a \"CBS Mornings\" interview, Chapman said Riibe \"didn't seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way,\" echoing previous comments from Riibe's attorneys and parents, who said in a statement that their son \"is deeply dismayed\" by Konanki's disappearance \"and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman said any inconsistencies in Riibe's statements \"were really quite minor and nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Asked if there's anything that indicates Konanki's disappearance is more than an accident, Chapman said, \"It's hard to say\" and acknowledged that some questions remain unanswered, including what happened after Konanki and Riibe were allegedly in the water.",
      "\"We also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say,\" he said. \"It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",

Russian drones were also reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.",
      "Emergency services said the hospital in Sumy was damaged and that about 150 patients were evacuated, but they did not report any casualties. That drone strike was first reported by top Zelenskyy aide Andriy Yermak, who, in a social media post about six hours after Mr. Trump's call with Putin ended, said, \"Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure and people right now,\" mentioning specifically the attack on the health facility.",

      "\"Just completed a very good telephone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine,\" the president\u00a0wrote. \"It lasted approximately one hour. Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track, and I will ask Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and national security adviser Michael Waltz, to give an accurate description of the points discussed. That statement will be put out shortly.\"",
      "The call comes a day after Mr. Trump's lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Mr. Trump said Putin agreed to a 30-day ceasefire against Ukraine's energy and infrastructure. The commitment fell short of the full ceasefire pushed by the U.S. and agreed to by Ukraine. Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 250 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",

      "But this was real. An urgent email was sent by a researcher at South Africa's isolated Sanae IV base in Antarctica accusing a man, one of the nine team members, of becoming violent and mentally unstable. In the email sent to a journalist at South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, the researcher, who has not been identified publicly, requests immediate action to ensure the team's safety.",
      "According to the Times, the researcher alleged that the male team member had physically assaulted a colleague, threatened to kill a different colleague and sexually assaulted another. However, South African officials later said the report of a sexual assault was not correct.",
      "\"His behavior has become increasingly egregious, and I am experiencing significant difficulty in feeling secure in his presence,\" the newspaper quoted the researcher as writing, adding: \"It is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure my safety and the safety of all employees.\"",
      "South Africa's Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment released a statement saying the alleged assault at the base was reported on Feb. 27, triggering a response plan that saw the government agency use \"trained professionals\" to mediate. The department said those mediators continued to engage with the team at the base on \"an almost daily basis.\"",
      "According to the agency, the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended.\"",
      "The statement went on to say the male perpetrator had written an apology to the victim and was willing \"to verbally apologize to other team members.\"",
      "South African Environment Minister Dion George told CBS News on Tuesday that \"the situation at the base remains calm and all is under control.\"",
      "\"I will be keeping close contact with the base to ensure it remains that way,\" said George, adding that a \"team of psychologists and other experts\" were also in \"direct and constant\" contact with the team.",
      "When pressed on what else he could do to ensure the safety of the team, George said he was \"considering available options.\"",
      "Those options may be few, as severe weather conditions have completely cut the base off from the sea. The base sits on stilts near a cliff edge \u2014 a row of buildings that the team will remain in until December, the heart of the Antarctic summer, when a ship is set to depart from South Africa to make the near-15-day journey to retrieve them.",
      "An emergency evacuation, at significant cost, would be required to get the team out before then.",
      "The environment department said it also activated a legal \"labor relations process to investigate the [claim of] physical assault and alleged sexual harassment.\"",
      "There have been several incidents in the past with team members at the remote base threatening violence, and at least two other team members have been evacuated during previous expeditions.",
      "The latest incident has fueled discussions about the reliability of the psychometric tests given to team members before they're deployed to the isolated station. Scientists sent previously to the base and others like it have spoken of how lonely it is, surrounded by white and silence and cut off from the rest of the world, and of the toll that can take on someone's mental health.",

      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe faces questioning, says he is cooperating",
      "Riibe has been in Punta Cana for questioning since the investigation got underway. He was confined to a hotel for more than a week, with officers escorting him anywhere he went, but a judge in the Dominican Republic ruled March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities confiscated Riibe's passport as he faced questioning, including direct interrogation by Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso. The judge's ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, and when he would be able to travel back to the U.S. remained unclear.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

    "story": [
      "An 81-year-old French hunter went on trial on Tuesday, accused of killing an endangered female bear that had attacked him in the Pyrenees.",
      "The brown bear is a protected species in the mountain range, which separates France and Spain.",
      "Andre Rives was boar-hunting when a female bear nicknamed Caramelles attacked him.",
      "On Nov. 20, 2021, two bear cubs emerged from the woods in front of Rives. Then their mother appeared, charging at him and dragging him for several yards. He shot and killed the animal.",
      "Rives sustained leg injuries and was in a state of shock. A fellow hunter managed to stem the bleeding before he was evacuated by helicopter.",
      "According to the investigation, the bear was killed 1,300 feet outside an authorized hunting area.",
      "The case caused an uproar in the department of Ariege, where hunters have held demonstrations in support of Rives.",
      "\"This is not an anti-bear or pro-bear trial,\" presiding judge Sun Yung Lazare said. Rives is on trial for \"destroying a protected species,\" she said.",
      "When the cubs emerged, \"I looked at them with admiration,\" Rives said in court. \"I made myself very small. Then the mother saw me. Our eyes met, she charged.\"",
      "He said he had no choice but to shoot.",
      "\"She grabbed my left thigh, I panicked and fired a shot. She backed away growling, she went around me and bit my right calf, I fell, she was eating my leg,\" he added. \"I reloaded my rifle and fired.\"",
      "\"Bears are threatened with extinction\"",
      "Fifteen other hunters who also took part in the hunt were being prosecuted for various offenses, including hunting in the Mont Valier nature reserve, one of the oldest reserves in the Pyrenees.",
      "Around 20 associations had filed a lawsuit.",
      "Jean-Luc Fernandez, president of a local hunting federation, said Rives killed the bear in self-defense.",
      "\"He fired,\" he said. \"He should have let her do it? No, he saved his own skin.\"",
      "The hunters also argued that the boundaries of the reserve were poorly marked.",
      "\"You never really know where you are,\" one of them said.",
      "Photos shown at the hearing showed barely visible signage \u2014 red Rs for reserve painted on trees against a white background.",
      "\"Your obligation as a hunter is to know where you are hunting,\" retorted prosecutor Olivier Mouysset.",
      "Activists contest the notion of self-defense.",
      "\"To what extent can one argue necessity, when one has committed a series of offenses that led to the death of the bear Caramelles?\" asked Alain Reynes of the bear-preservation association Pays de l'ours. According to that group, in 2023, there were 83 bears detected in the Pyrenees and 11 females gave birth.",
      "Animal rights activists view bears as integral to maintaining a fragile mountain ecosystem that is under threat from human activity and climate change.",
      "Bears had nearly disappeared from the mountain range before France began a reintroduction program in the 1990s, importing them from Slovenia.",
      "But the presence of bears has led to increasing tensions with farmers because of the threat they pose to their livestock.",
      "Julie Rover, a lawyer representing some of the associations, said the animal rights' activists wanted to send a message.",
      "\"They are not opposed to hunting, but for it not to harm the environment, its rules must be respected,\" Rover said.",
      "\"Bears are threatened with extinction \u2014 the disappearance of a breeding female is serious.\"",

    "summary": "Officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza say the new Israeli assault has killed more than 400 people, as Israel accuses Hamas of refusing to extend the ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel has launched new strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry, and promising to wield \"increasing military force\" after talks on further hostage releases stalled, according to officials on both sides of the war. The resumption of Israel's war against Hamas on Monday came after almost two months of relative calm in Gaza under a ceasefire the U.S. helped to broker, but which Israel and Hamas could not agree on how to continue.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement its military is \"currently attacking targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, with the aim of achieving the war goals as determined by the political echelon, including the release of all our hostages \u2014 living and dead.\"",
      "\"From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\" the prime minister's office said.",
      "The health ministry in Gaza, a densely populated coastal enclave that has been run by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas for almost two decades, said at least 404 people had been killed in Israel's fresh strikes by midday on Tuesday. Video from the territory showed bodies lined up on the floors of hospitals as more casualties streamed in.",
      "The statement from Netanyahu's office said Israel was resuming strikes because of Hamas' repeated refusals to release its hostages and its rejection of all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.",
      "\"If Hamas does not release all the kidnapped, the gates of hell will open in Gaza and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said. \"We will not stop fighting until all the kidnapped return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Witkoff warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately \"or pay a severe price.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday evening that the Trump administration was consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza.",
      "\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Hostages families, U.N. and Egypt condemn resumption of war",
      "The group representing the Israeli hostages' families condemned Netanyahu's decision to resume the fighting, accusing him of a \"complete deception,\" arguing that it would endanger the remaining captives, and quickly organizing a new protest against the move.",
      "\"The families' greatest fear has come true \u2014 the Israeli government has chosen to give up on the abductees. We are shocked, angry and anxious about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from Hamas captivity,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.",
      "\"Returning to fighting before the last abductee is returned will come at the cost of the 59 abductees who are still in Gaza and could be saved and returned,\" the group said, accusing Netanyahu's government of having \"refused to declare an end to the war in order to implement the next steps in the [ceasefire] deal and return all the abductees.\"",
      "The forum dismissed Netanyahu's claim that the resumption of fighting was intended to secure the remaining hostages' release as \"a complete deception.\"",
      "The forum said \"families are now making their way to Jerusalem and calling on the people of Israel to stand with them\" in a protest on Tuesday. \"There is nothing more urgent than this! With each passing day, the danger to the hostages grows. Military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them home safely.\"",
      "United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he was \"horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza, which killed hundreds, according to the Ministry of Health in the strip,\" adding that it would \"add tragedy onto tragedy.\"",
      "Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the U.N. chief was \"shocked by the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, in which a meaningful number of civilians have been killed. He strongly appeals for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to be reestablished and for the remaining hostages to be released unconditionally.\"",
      "Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire along with the U.S. and Qatar, issued a statement condemning Israel's actions, which it called \"a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a dangerous escalation that threatens to have dire consequences for the stability of the region.\"",
      "\"Egypt reiterates its complete rejection of all Israeli attacks aimed at re-igniting tension in the region and thwarting efforts aimed at calming the situation and restoring stability. It calls on the international community to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip and prevent the region from re-entering a new cycle of violence and counter-violence,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Hamas says Israel \"fully responsible for violating and overturning\" ceasefire",
      "Hamas also condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of breaching the ceasefire and putting the fate of the remaining hostages in jeopardy.",
      "In a statement, Hamas said it would hold Netanyahu's government \"fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"",
      "\"Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\" said Hamas, adding a demand for the U.S. and its negotiating partners Egypt and Qatar to \"hold Netanyahu and the Zionist occupation fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement.\"",
      "In a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said Israel's \"coordination with the U.S. administration prior to the attacks confirms the U.S. partnership in the genocide perpetrated against our people and its role in covering up Israeli war crimes.\"",
      "What happened during the ceasefire?",
      "The new strikes come amid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month-long war that saw dozens of hostages released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire ended on March 1 but the pause in major fighting held until Monday.",
      "Since the first phase of the ceasefire ended, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward to a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. Netanyahu had repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and President Trump had also issued several warnings and ultimatums to Hamas \u2014 some contradicting the agreed-upon terms of the ceasefire \u2014  as negotiations on a second phase of the ceasefire struggled to materialize.",
      "Egypt, Qatar and the United States had been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.",
      "Earlier in the month, Israel cut off aid into Gaza, stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Palestinian territory. Israel said the aid blockade was aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a\u00a0proposal drafted by the Trump administration to extend the first phase\u00a0of the ceasefire. Under the proposal, Israel had demanded Hamas immediately hand over half of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, which would have been a significant change in the terms initially agreed to under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said it had accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals who had died in captivity. Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer last week, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "In a separate Friday statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas' commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.",
      "The agreement had called for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.",
      "While the ceasefire largely halted the fighting, Israel has left troops in Gaza throughout the past two months and continued to strike targets, claiming that Palestinians were trying to carry out attacks or approaching troops in no-go zones.   A number of strikes earlier Monday killed a total of 10 people, according to Palestinian officials.",

    "story": [
      "London - Some court documents related to a freedom of information request to access Prince Harry's U.S. immigration files were released on Tuesday, under an order issued by a Washington D.C. district court, after the conservative Heritage Foundation alleged that the British royal\u00a0may have concealed past drug use when he applied for his visa. Harry currently lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their children.",
      "The documents released included court filings from several federal agencies responding to the Heritage Foundation's request. They did not include the prince's immigration records. Portions of the documents relating to him or his immigration status were heavily redacted.",
      "Applications for visas to live in the United States ask about current and historical drug use. Admission of drug use can lead to visa applications being rejected, but immigration officers have discretion to make their final decisions on a number of factors. Lying on visa applications can lead to lifetime bans on entering the U.S.",
      "\"There's a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said.",
      "The Heritage Foundation alleges that Harry may have lied about his past drug use on his application. Their allegations center around claims Harry made in his memoir, published in January 2023, where he described using various types of drugs.",
      "Cocaine \"wasn't much fun, and it didn't make me particularly happy, as it seemed to make everyone around me, but it did make me feel different, and that was the main goal,\" Harry wrote.",
      "He also wrote: \"Marijuana is different. That actually really did help me.\"",
      "The Heritage Foundation lodged a freedom of information request with the Department of Homeland Security in 2023, not long after his book was published, seeking access to Harry's immigration documents.",
      "\"Harry has publicly admitted to extensive illegal drug use. What do we submit this means? That Harry seems to have received special treatment: the DHS looked the other way if the Prince answered truthfully, or it looked the other way if the Prince lied on his visa application. Either action would be wrong,\" Nile Gardiner from the Heritage Foundation said in an online post in 2024.",
      "Harry and Meghan moved to the U.S. in 2020 after stepping down as working members of Britain's royal family.",
      "Meghan is a U.S. citizen, but it is unclear what visa Harry entered the country on. The prince has not responded publicly to the Heritage Foundation's assertions.",
      "In February, President Trump ruled out deporting Harry, saying he would \"leave him alone,\" adding, \"He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.\"",
      "Meghan has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Most Americans dislike the idea of celebrities being treated differently from anyone else, and Harry's fame and profile makes this case the ideal window into DHS conduct,\" the Heritage Foundation's Gardiner argued. \"If DHS granted Harry special treatment, the implications are obvious: it has likely granted such treatment in the past to others sufficiently famous or sufficiently politically aligned, and will likely continue to do so.\"",

      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" Chapman said.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The student, 20, was last seen in the early morning hours of March 6\u00a0on a beach near the resort town's Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel where she and her friends and had been staying. Surveillance video from the night she disappeared showed Konanki walking toward the beach with a group of three women and two men, one of whom authorities identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, who is presumed to be the last person to see her alive. She and Riibe stayed behind on the beach after the four others left, a police source told CBS News, citing video footage.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and struggled in rough waters. He said he believed Konanki made it out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "Konanki lives in the D.C. suburb Loudon, Virginia, and attends the University of Pittsburgh. Her disappearance sparked a missing persons investigation and massive search effort by authorities in the Dominican Republic and the United States, with agencies probing land, sea and air in hopes of locating her. The Dominican Republic National Police said they created a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, while Interpol issued a missing person alert to police around the world.",
      "Authorities in the U.S. and the Dominican Republic have repeatedly emphasized that this is so far not a criminal investigation. Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said investigators are exploring whether Konanki may have drowned but have not ruled out the possibility of foul play. In their request that law enforcement declare her dead, Konanki's family referenced the lack of evidence suggesting foul play so far.",
      "Since Konanki vanished, Reynoso has directly interrogated Riibe, a student at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is originally from Iowa, the law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, told CBS News. Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport while holding him for questioning in Punta Cana and assigning him \"permanent\" police escorts, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza said.",
      "Riibe's attorney has been pushing for his release, noting in legal filings that his client has not been charged with a crime, local media reported. A hearing on that issue was set for later Tuesday.",
      "Chapman described Riibe as \"very forthcoming\" in interviews with two of the sheriff's detectives who traveled to Punta Cana last week to discuss the case with him. In a \"CBS Mornings\" interview, Chapman said Riibe \"didn't seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way,\" echoing previous comments from Riibe's attorneys and parents, who said in a statement that their son \"is deeply dismayed\" by Konanki's disappearance \"and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman said any inconsistencies in Riibe's statements \"were really quite minor and nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Asked if there's anything that indicates Konanki's disappearance is more than an accident, Chapman said, \"It's hard to say\" and acknowledged that some questions remain unanswered, including what happened after Konanki and Riibe were allegedly in the water.",
      "\"We also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say,\" he said. \"It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",

      "Children's prayers for the pope",
      "Earlier, dozens of children toting yellow and white balloons \u2014 many from war-torn countries \u2014 gathered outside Rome's Gemelli hospital to greet Pope Francis on his fifth Sunday hospitalized. While the pope did not appear from the 10th-floor suite of windows, he thanked them and acknowledged their presence in the traditional Sunday blessing.",
      "\"I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to Gemelli as a sign of closeness,'' the pontiff said in the Angelus text prepared for the traditional prayer but not delivered live again. \"Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you,'' Francis said.",
      "The Rev. Enzo Fortunato, president of the pontifical committee for World Children's Day who organized the event, said that the gathering of children with their parents was a form of spiritual medicine for the 88-year-old pontiff. He called it ''the most beautiful caress.''",
      "\"The children represent a symbolic medicine for Pope Francis,'' Fortunato said. ''Letting him know that so many children are here for him cheers the heart.''",
      "A small group of children, whose balloons represented the colors of the Vatican flag, briefly entered the hospital to leave behind their drawings, messages and flowers for Francis. Many of the children came from poorer Italian districts or from countries impacted by war, some having arrived in Italy from Afghanistan and Syria via humanitarian corridors set up by the Sant'Egidio charity in agreement with the Italian government; others were from Ukraine, Gaza, South America and Africa.",

      "\"This pope is not just a religious leader, he is a great global leader. A man of peace. This pope is pope of the children.'' Iacomini said.",
      "Francis typically delivers the Angelus from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square to the gathered faithful, who have grown more numerous due to the Jubilee year that Francis inaugurated in December.",
      "In the written text, Francis said he was thinking of others, who like him, are in a fragile state. \"Our bodies are weak, but even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope,'' the pope said.",
      "Along with a stop at St. Peter's to seek indulgences by walking through the basilica's Holy Door, pilgrims are now also adding a stop at Gemelli, a 15-minute train ride from the Vatican.",
      "Pope's condition remains complex",
      "Doctors this week said the pontiff was no longer in critical, life-threatening condition, but they have continued to emphasize that his condition remained complex due to his age, lack of mobility and the loss of part of a lung as a young man.",
      "Still, they are issuing fewer medical bulletins as the pontiff has been on an upward trajectory. An X-ray this week confirmed that the infection was clearing.",
      "Francis has not been seen publicly since he was admitted to the hospital Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. Doctors soon added a diagnosis of double pneumonia and a polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection.",
      "The first three weeks of his hospitalization were marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure and a severe coughing fit.",
      "Doctors in the most recent medical update on Saturday said they were working to reduce the pope's nighttime reliance on the non-invasive ventilation mask, which will allow his lungs to work more.",

      "Faith factor",
      "Data shows that people who regularly go to church live anywhere from four to 14 years longer than people who don't, Buettner noted.",
      "\"You can't measure faith, but you can measure religiosity,\" he said. \"Scientists simply ask people how often they show up at church, temple or mosque, and then they compare the longevity of the people who show up to those who don't show up at all.\"",
      "WARDING OFF DEMENTIA MEANS MORE READING, PRAYING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC: STUDY",
      "Part of this likely stems from the fact that churchgoers have a built-in community, he said, as loneliness has proven to be \"toxic.\"",

      "Sleep's role in health",
      "In his visits to blue zones, Buettner found that the residents are usually early to bed, early to rise.",
      "\"They have kind of two sleeps, where they'll go to bed shortly after sunset, and then get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and do some chores, and then go back to sleep until sunrise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

The Daily Caller News Foundation first reported that the Biden administration \"intentionally buried\" the study.",

      "Fox News independently reviewed a copy of that draft study, titled, \"Energy, Economic, and Environmental Assessment of U.S. LNG Exports.\" That report and its findings were slated for publication in 2023 \u2014 months before then-President Joe Biden, who was still seeking re-election at the time, announced a pause on all new U.S. LNG export terminals in January 2024, citing the need to better consider environmental and economic impacts.",

      "\"\u200b\u200bSecretary Granholm, and Biden White House told Americans that the increase in LNG exports would disproportionately increase prices for American consumers as well as from the environment,\" an official said.",

      "At the time, Biden was facing mounting criticism from progressives in the party to scale back LNG exports, which during his term rose to an all-time high. The U.S. became the world's largest energy exporter in 2023, underpinned by new demand in the EU, following Russia's war in Ukraine, and its abrupt cutoff of nearly all piped gas supplies to the bloc.",

      "That prompted fierce pushback from progressive Democrats, including Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., which put new pressure on the administration for the pause.",
      "However, rather than come forward with the report, the Biden administration continued to stall on releasing the study and declined to comply with requests from the House Oversight Committee to testify or share their findings, Trump administration officials said.",

      "\"Many are suggesting that the Biden pardons may now be challenged in light of the disclosures of Biden's use of an autopen,\" Turley, a Fox News contributor, wrote on X Tuesday. \"The chances of such challenges succeeding are vanishingly low. Presidents are allowed to use the autopen and courts will not presume a dead-hand conspiracy.\"",

      "President Donald Trump has been sounding the alarm on Biden's prevalent use of an autopen for official presidential documents, most notably for official presidential pardons before he left office in January. On Monday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social that Biden's pardons for individuals connected to the Jan. 6 select committee investigation another are \"void.\"",
      "\"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,\" Trump wrote.",
      "\"In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level,\" he added.",
      "At the heart of the issue over the use of an autopen, which have been frequently used by presidential administrations across the decades, is concern over Biden's mental acuity when he served in the White House. Trump said Sunday that though he uses the autopen for documents such as letters, he does not use an autopen for legally binding documents.",

      "Michael O'Neill, the vice president of legal affairs at Landmark Legal Foundation \u2014 a conservative legal advocacy group that works to defend the Constitution \u2014 told Fox News Digital that, to his knowledge, \"there hasn't been a case where the limits of this power have been challenged.\"",
      "\"Biden's pardons at the end of his term certainly test whether there are any limits to the presidential pardon power,\" O'Neill said. \"Can a president issue blanket pardons encompassing any crime an individual may be accused of over ten years? This is a legitimate question that has yet to be addressed by the courts because no president has abused this authority until Biden. Another question is whether the pardons are valid if executed without the president's knowledge \u2014 i.e. via autopen.\"",
      "\"If an individual who has received a pardon is indicted, they would, most likely, assert pardon as an affirmative defense,\" he added. \"Lower courts would, most likely, uphold the dismissal, leaving it to SCOTUS to define the contours of the pardon power.

      "Heritage's Project Oversight posted a memo on its ongoing investigation into the matter Monday, reporting that researchers are wading through copious amounts of \"public documents discharging non-delegable Presidential powers containing former President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s signature.\"",

      "\"Start with the Constitution,\" the memo reported. \"Multiple Constitutional provisions, like the pardon power, vest those powers solely in the President. In those cases, the President affixing his signature is his execution of the acts as President.\"",
      "\"The Founding Fathers contemplated these issues when writing the Constitution. For example, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2 of the Constitution lays out the role of the President to sign or veto legislation. Early debates at the Constitutional Convention concerning this provision made it clear that regardless of the structure of the Executive Branch, the President would maintain a necessary affirmative approbation of legislation presented to him. The act of the President affixing his signature manually to a bill is his consent and is the very act that causes a bill to become law; it is in no way ministerial. Until he signs, there is no law,\" the legal explanation continued.",
      "The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in 2005 under former President George W. Bush's administration determined that the president is permitted to use an autopen to sign bills into law.",

      "The Project Oversight memo, however, hit back that the opinion is \"wrong.\"",
      "\"This opinion is wrong. But even that erroneous opinion was clear that \u2018(w)e emphasize that we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill, only that, having made this decision, he may direct a subordinate to affix the President\u2019s signature to the bill,\u2019\" the memo said.",

This potentially gives them access to sensitive information like login credentials, credit card details or private messages. In some cases, they may even modify the data, leading to fraud or data breaches.",

      "Change-of-address scams involve some of the most seemingly harmless personal information getting into the wrong hands. This can lead to a whole host of problems, including financial losses and identity theft, although change-of-address fraud is technically a form of identity theft.",
      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "This detailed breakdown explains the process of a change-of-address scam, from initial targeting to the potential consequences and warning signs to watch for.",
      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",
      "The other major things to keep an eye on are your credit report, credit card statements and bank statements. You can request a free credit report from one of the three credit bureaus once per year.",

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: Have your personal information removed from data broker databases, including people search sites. They\u2019re the first port of call for many scammers. Without these companies in the mix, scammers aren\u2019t likely to come across your address in the first place.",

      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "3. Secure your mailbox: Consider upgrading to a\u00a0locked mailbox\u00a0to prevent mail theft. If you live in an area prone to mail theft, this simple step can stop criminals from intercepting sensitive documents before they even reach you.",
      "4. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "6. Consider using a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure to smishing attacks by removing your sensitive information \u2014 like phone numbers, addresses and email details \u2014 from data broker websites. Scammers often rely on these publicly available databases to target victims with personalized phishing texts. These services aren\u2019t foolproof, but they can make it harder for cybercriminals to find and exploit your information.

      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking. The accuracy of these systems is impressive, with detection rates ranging from 88% to 99.5% and false positives as low as 0.5% to 12%.",

      "Despite the safety benefits, the installation of AI dashcams raises significant privacy issues. Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets. Motive's AI dash cam also incorporates blurring technology to protect the privacy of individuals captured in the footage, further addressing concerns about recording private citizens without consent.",

      "What is CVE-2025-24201?",
      "This vulnerability resides in WebKit, the open-source browser engine that powers Safari, Mail, App Store and other apps on Apple devices. The flaw is an out-of-bounds write issue, which allows attackers to use maliciously crafted web content to bypass the Web Content sandbox, a key security layer that isolates web content from accessing sensitive system resources. Apple has acknowledged that\u00a0this vulnerability may have been exploited in highly advanced attacks targeting specific individuals using older versions of iOS before 17.2. These attacks are believed to involve well-funded threat actors, such as state-sponsored hackers or advanced cybercriminal groups.",
      "Why does this matter?",
      "Zero-day vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-24201 are particularly dangerous because they are exploited before developers can patch them. In this case, the attacks were highly targeted, meaning most users are unlikely to have been affected directly. However, these incidents underscore the importance of regularly updating your devices to stay protected against evolving threats.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users.

The system can only be activated under certain driving conditions, requiring specific environmental and traffic criteria to be met. Also, drivers must remain alert and prepared to take control at a moment's notice, which can be a difficult standard to maintain. Regulatory authorities also face challenges in setting and enforcing standards for this level of autonomy, as it requires a delicate balance between safety and technological innovation.",

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) wrote on its X account that it was \"conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip.\" Israel pointed to Hamas\u2019 repeated refusal to accept a hostage release and ceasefire extension as the reason for the return to war.",

The Houthis have disrupted global trade, attacked U.S. forces and fueled instability. That said, it\u2019s unclear how far the U.S. is willing to go in its campaign against them. The Red Sea and the Strait of Mandab are among the most strategic trade routes in the world, carrying over 20% of oil shipments and 13% of global trade.\"",

      "\"We will demand that ironclad security guarantees become part of this agreement,\" Grushko was quoted by the Russian newspaper Izvestia as saying, according to Reuters. \"Part of these guarantees should be the neutral status of Ukraine, the refusal of NATO countries to accept it into the alliance.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department is pushing back against a federal judge's request for more information about the deportation flights that took off over the weekend after President Donald Trump invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg had ordered the Trump administration to submit answers to his questions about the timing of the deportation flights and custody handover of deportees, giving the government until noon Wednesday to respond.",
      "The government submitted a filing Wednesday morning asking for a pause of Boasberg's order to answer his questions.",
      "\"Continuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts and wholly within a sphere of core functions of the Executive Branch is both purposeless and frustrating to the consideration of the actual legal issues at stake in this case,\" the DOJ wrote in the filing.",
      "The judge had initially ordered the government to answer his questions surrounding the flights by noon Tuesday. The Justice Department declined to answer some of his questions, saying, \u201cIf, however, the Court nevertheless orders the Government to provide additional details, the Court should do so through an in camera and ex parte declaration, in order to protect sensitive information bearing on foreign relations.\u201d",
      "Boasberg agreed and directed DOJ attorneys to submit under seal the answers to his questions about the deportations that were carried out under the terms of a rarely used wartime act by noon Wednesday.",
      "In its response Wednesday, the government blasted the judge for accepting its proposal and suggested he not take any action until an appeals court rules on its request for a stay.",
      "\"The Court has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the Government\u2019s flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts before certifying the class action in this case. That observation reflects how upside-down this case has become, as digressive micromanagement has outweighed consideration of the case\u2019s legal issues,\" the DOJ filing said. \"The distraction of the specific facts surrounding the movements of an airplane has derailed this case long enough and should end until the Circuit Court has had a chance to weigh in,\" it added.",
      "The legal saga began after Boasberg blocked deportations stemming from the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. On Saturday, Boasberg said that planes carrying people being deported under the act\u2019s authority must turn around. Planes carrying deportees later touched down in El Salvador, raising questions about whether the government defied a court order.",
      "The government said in a filing Tuesday that the judge\u2019s order lacked proper jurisdiction \u201cbecause the presidential actions they challenge are not subject to judicial review.\u201d The administration also argued that it did not violate the judge\u2019s order because \u201cthe relevant flights left U.S. airspace\u201d before Boasberg\u2019s\u00a0written ruling.",
      "In the same filing, however, the government declined to provide details requested by the judge, arguing that the government should \u201cnot be required to disclose sensitive information bearing on national security and foreign relations\u201d until a motion to pause was resolved."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/musk-uses-immigration-claims-voter-fraud-sell-social-security-cuts-rcna196863",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:45:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Elon Musk has falsely claimed that undocumented immigrants are siphoning away billions of dollars worth of entitlements as part of a Democratic scheme for votes.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk and the Trump administration are pitching cuts in one of the most politically dangerous arenas in America \u2014 the Social Security Administration.",
      "Musk has cast the idea as one that\u2019s primarily about immigration, falsely claiming that undocumented immigrants are fraudulently accessing hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of entitlements, including Social Security, Medicaid and disability programs, as part of a Democratic scheme for votes.",
      "\u201cBy using entitlements fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants,\u201d Musk, the billionaire tech CEO behind the Department of Government Efficiency, said Monday on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, without evidence. \u201cAnd buy voters. Basically bring in 10, 20 million people who are beholden to the Democrats for government handouts and will vote overwhelmingly Democrat, as has been demonstrated in California.\u201d",
      "Musk told Cruz, R-Texas, that his efforts to end the alleged fraud are why people on the left \u201chate my guts and want me to die.\u201d He said the fraud has cost the government $100 billion to $200 billion.",
      "It\u2019s an argument Musk has been making repeatedly in recent weeks, as DOGE and the Trump administration announce and push for more cuts to the SSA, including eliminating thousands of employees from the already lean agency, ending the ability to make claims by phone and shuttering dozens of field offices that help seniors access their benefits.",
      "The Trump administration has said repeatedly it isn\u2019t cutting benefits \u2014 just fraud. And while it\u2019s well known that fraud exists in programs such as Social Security and disability programs, experts say Americans and overseas crime rings are typically perpetrating fraud on entitlements. Asked for comment on Musk\u2019s remarks and proof that immigrants living in the United States without legal status were to blame for the fraud, the White House didn\u2019t offer any.",
      "\u201cIf NBC wants to die on the hill of objecting to credible claims of fraud in our entitlements, especially by the millions of illegals Joe Biden let into this country, have at it,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said in a statement. \u201cOur federal government is riddled with fraud, and President Trump is putting an end to that despite opposition from complacent Democrats and the mainstream media.\u201d",
      "Social Security sends retired people checks every month based on their incomes as working people, and it also sends checks to disabled people. Medicaid insures low-income people, while Medicare provides health insurance for people older than 65. Broadly, immigrants without legal status don\u2019t qualify for federal dollars through the programs. Some states do fund health care for undocumented immigrants like pregnant women, and Medicaid will reimburse hospitals for emergency health care provided to low-income, undocumented immigrants, as hospitals aren\u2019t allowed to turn away people seeking emergency care. That amounts to less than 1% of Medicaid\u2019s annual spending.",
      "Social Security cuts have been a major focus of tense town halls for Republican lawmakers, with constituents expressing fear that cuts at the SSA could make it harder for them to access their benefits.",
      "According to a May report from the Office of the Inspector General, people were already experiencing prolonged wait times working with the SSA. The report noted that in-office appointments could be completely booked up for more than 40 days in the future and that it could take months for promised services to be delivered. The report said 65% of Social Security beneficiaries were unaware that there were online services for the agency.",
      "But even with constituents struggling to interface with the SSA, Musk has portrayed pushback to his changes as politically motivated.",
      "\u201cThis is why the Democrats are so upset about the situation,\u201d Musk said on Fox Business last week. \u201cIf we turn off this gigantic money magnet for illegal immigrants, then they will leave and they will lose voters.\u201d",
      "\u201cEntitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here,\u201d he told Joe Rogan last month, without providing evidence. Musk has repeatedly posted a clip of that part of his interview, too.",
      "Musk\u2019s argument crucially cast significant cuts to Social Security as a critical part of Trump\u2019s agenda cracking down on illegal immigration, his most popular major issue, according to recent polling by NBC News. It\u2019s also fundamentally inaccurate, experts and former executives told NBC News, warning that cuts made in the name of fraud will hurt eligible recipients of government benefits.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the numbers, it\u2019s actually the opposite: Undocumented immigrants cannot get SSI or Social Security benefits, but in fact, the undocumented immigrants contribute a lot to the Social Security system,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that studies government spending.",
      "In 2022, immigrants working in the United States without legal authorization paid $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes and $6.4 billion in Medicare taxes, according to a recent analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. It\u2019s one of the things bolstering the program despite challenging demographics as the baby boomers retire with fewer younger, working people paying into the program at the same time.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how far Musk, who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, might want to go in changing Social Security, a program that dates to an act President Franklin Roosevelt signed in 1935 and currently provides benefits to more than 73 million retired and disabled people. As Musk has immersed himself in politics over the past year, he has posted about the program only occasionally.",
      "But Musk, who has called it \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,\u201d has expressed interest at least once in the idea of privatizing Social Security. In December, he shared a social media thread about the topic by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Lee had called Social Security a \u201cnightmare\u201d and wrote that people would be better off managing retirement savings at least partly on their own. Musk called Lee\u2019s views \u201cinteresting.\u201d",
      "Trump voiced support for privatizing Social Security back in 2004, but as a candidate and as president, he has vowed to protect entitlements.",
      "Musk\u2019s latest statements haven\u2019t included a mention of privatization, focusing instead on the idea that there\u2019s widespread fraud or abuse by undocumented immigrants in the system \u2014 an allegation for which he hasn\u2019t offered evidence and that experts say is inaccurate.",
      "Fraud exists within every government program, but a former executive at the SSA with knowledge of the agency\u2019s anti-fraud program said overseas criminal rings\u2019 stealing eligible people\u2019s benefits and people\u2019s faking disability or not reporting relatives\u2019 deaths are the most common types of Social Security fraud, not fraud involving undocumented immigrants.",
      "Drawing on Social Security requires people to verify their eligibility and work histories, effectively preventing immigrants without legal status from drawing benefits.",
      "The former executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that undocumented immigrants who pay into the program by using other people\u2019s Social Security numbers pose bureaucratic challenges when the actual owners of the Social Security numbers apply for benefits but that immigrants aren\u2019t receiving any benefits.",
      "Musk\u2019s claim of a pipeline of undocumented immigrants to Democratic voters is also inaccurate. He is wrong to say undocumented immigrants are voting in statewide elections. Washington, D.C., and some municipalities in three states allow immigrants with legal status to vote in local elections, but it\u2019s illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and no state allows noncitizens to vote in its elections, either. Some undocumented immigrants do eventually obtain citizenship \u2014 such as through marriage \u2014 that would allow them to vote. That process takes a minimum of three to five years."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is pausing $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender athlete policies, the White House announced Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "The post said the Ivy League university's policies are \"forcing women to compete with men in sports\" and ended with the Trump tagline, \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "The University of Pennsylvania did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The White House announcement follows an executive order signed last month by President Donald Trump prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing in female sports.",
      "The order, which referred to trans women as men, said having trans women and girls compete in women's sports \"is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.\"",
      "The order also stated that \"it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.\"",
      "Penn made national headlines in 2022 when a transgender student athlete, Lia Thomas, competed on the women's swim team and went on to become the first transgender woman to\u00a0win\u00a0an NCAA swimming championship.",
      "Thomas faced intense backlash, including repeated misgendering from conservative news outlets, some of which also posted pre-transition photos of her and used her deadname, meaning her legal name prior to transition.",
      "Three former Penn swimmers filed a lawsuit last month against the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, the Ivy League and the NCAA for allegedly violating Title IX, a civil rights law that prevents sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities that receive federal funding.",
      "The Trump administration's announcement Wednesday follows investigations it opened last month into the University of Pennsylvania over Thomas' participation and San Jose State University over a player's participation on the women's volleyball team. The San Jose State student has never publicly commented on the controversy or confirmed that she is transgender.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News that the Trump administration paused the funds due to Thomas' participation, referring to Thomas as male and condemning her access to the locker room. However, the official said the federal funding pause is not the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Education Department and that the funds were paused by the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.",
      "The official described the funding pause as an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The official did not clarify what the discretionary funding is for or why it was being paused if not due to an alleged Title IX violation.",
      "Trump's executive order barring trans girls and women from participating in women's sports rolled back Biden administration guidance that required schools to allow trans students to access school sports teams and sex-segregated facilities that align with their gender identities.\u00a0The order tasked the Education Department with investigating potential violations.",
      "White House officials told reporters at the time that the administration also planned to work with sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee, to ensure the guidance is followed in noneducational settings.",
      "Last month, a judge allowed two trans students who filed a lawsuit against New Hampshire's law prohibiting trans girls from playing on female sports teams to expand their challenge to also include Trump's executive order.",
      "A federal judge in New Hampshire ruled last fall that the two girls could try out for their high school soccer and tennis teams while their lawsuit proceeds.",
      "\u201cI love playing soccer and we had a great season last fall,\u201d one of the plaintiffs, Parker Tirrell, who is in 10th grade, said in a statement last month. \u201cI just want to go to school like other kids and keep playing the game I love.\u201d",
      "Chris Erchull, a senior staff attorney at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, one of the groups representing the teens, said the Trump administration's executive orders targeting trans people \"amount to a coordinated campaign to prevent transgender people from functioning in society.\"",
      "\u201cThe systematic targeting of transgender people across American institutions is chilling, but targeting young people in schools, denying them support and essential opportunities during their most vulnerable years, is especially cruel,\u201d\u00a0Erchull said in a statement last month. \u201cSchool sports are an important part of education\u2014something no child should be denied simply because of who they are. Our clients Parker and Iris simply want to go to school, learn, and play on teams with their peers.\u201d",
      "In addition to his order pertaining to trans student athletes, Trump signed an order proclaiming that the\u00a0government will recognize only two unchangeable sexes. He also signed orders\u00a0barring trans people from serving openly in the military\u00a0and\u00a0restricting access to gender-affirming care\u00a0for trans people younger than 19 nationwide. The last two orders have been temporarily blocked by courts."

It enjoyed a late surge in support against its fellow deep-sea dweller the orange roughy, which had been in the lead but ended up losing by almost 300 votes.",

      "The U.S. central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged as it waits to see how the president\u2019s expanding trade war, mass firings of federal workers and other changes affect the economy.",
      "A host of indicators, not to mention comments from Trump administration officials themselves, suggest that consumer spending and employers\u2019 hiring are both slowing. After an initial burst of optimism upon Trump\u2019s election, growth now looks to be more subdued. Meanwhile, federal workforce cuts by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have also raised concerns about pressure on local economies, not to mention the ability of newly jobless workers to receive unemployment assistance.",
      "The sweeping changes have also heightened uncertainty among investors. Last week, the S&P 500 slipped into correction territory, marking a 10% drop from its latest peak, for the first time in three years.",
      "As surveys suggest consumer and business confidence is tanking, Trump and senior officials have changed their messaging since the campaign, warning consumers to brace for potential economic pain and declining to rule out the possibility of a recession. Trump has signaled the economy may be in for a period of \u201ctransition\u201d as his policies take effect, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the U.S. must \u201cdetox\u201d from its reliance on public spending.",
      "The upheaval has created a more difficult backdrop for the Federal Reserve to navigate as it sets borrowing rates for the U.S. The central bank is charged by Congress with helping keep both unemployment and inflation low. Right now, both are fairly subdued. Yet, there are signs they are set to rise as the Trump administration looks to slash government agencies and impose steep new tariffs that major businesses have already warned shoppers could pay for.",
      "\u201cThey are facing the most difficult challenge a central bank ever faces when the shock is both pushing up prices, in terms of imports, and reducing jobs, in terms of input costs,\u201d former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said in a post on X on Tuesday. \u201cThis is what tariffs do.\u201d",
      "Summers called the current trends in the economy a \u201cstagflationary shock,\u201d a view other economic commentators have echoed as a series of recent surveys show rising pessimism on everything from the job market to the pace of price increases.",
      "So far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has projected calm.",
      "\u201cDespite elevated levels of uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to be in a good place,\u201d Powell said earlier this month. \u201cWe do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\u201d",
      "Still, investors sizing up the first two months of the Trump administration now believe the Fed is likely to cut interest rates at least twice this year to keep the economy on track. That\u2019s a substantial shift compared with expectations at the outset of the year for as few as none at all.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Reserve is likely to provide a policy boost [through lower interest rates] in the second half of 2025, if not earlier, as the economy weakens and as labor market cracks widen,\u201d Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note to clients Monday.",
      "That\u2019s largely because the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on prices remains to be seen, she said. Some analysts had earlier hoped his hard-line trade proposals would be used as bargaining chips with foreign governments, rather than actually implemented, but that view has since retreated.",
      "\u201cSignals from the Administration that they are not prepared to rule out recession are compounding the recent growth worry,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients Sunday.",
      "The White House may be waiting for the Fed to move first and lower rates to support Trump\u2019s economic agenda, said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at the consultancy Renaissance Macro. That could give the White House a target to blame for any adverse economic outcomes, he speculated in a note to clients Monday.",
      "\u201cIf the Fed is hawkish, markets will probably weaken further; as a result, they\u2019ll take some of the heat off the White House for the recent selloff in [the] equity market,\u201d Dutta wrote. \u201cIf they are dovish, they may well encourage the administration to dial up the heat even more. Thus, it\u2019s best to say nothing.\u201d"

      "Why did the ceasefire breakdown?",
      "Both Israel and the Trump administration have blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group's refusal to meet Israel's demand to release more hostages in return for the resumption of talks.",
      "But this was not part of the original ceasefire agreement that went into effect Jan. 19. The first phase of that deal, which had Hamas release 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for  around 1,800 of Palestinian prisoners, ended March 1.",
      "The second phase was set to kick in 16 days later and would have included the exchange of all the remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire. In phase three, the bodies of all dead hostages were to be returned and a commitment made to rebuild Gaza."

    "story": [
      "Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil says he was \"targeted\" for advocating for the Palestinian cause in a new letter from a detention facility, as a judge ruled his challenge to his arrest should proceed in New Jersey court.",
      "\"I wake to cold mornings and spend long days bearing witness to the quiet injustices underway against a great many people precluded from the protections of the law,\" Khalil said in the letter dictated over the phone to his family Monday.",
      "The 30-year-old legal U.S. resident, who played a major role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last spring, was arrested by federal immigration agents in New York on March 8. He was briefly detained in New Jersey and transferred to a facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he remains.\u00a0He is an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent and is married to a U.S. citizen.",
      "Khalil had filed a challenge to his detention in a Manhattan federal court. On Wednesday morning, a judge denied the Trump administration\u2019s motion to dismiss his challenge \u2014 but allowed the case to move to New Jersey. Khalil has yet to be accused of a crime.",
      "Judge Jesse M. Furman said that Khalil's allegations are \"serious\" and \u201cwarrant careful review.\" The judge noted that when Khalil\u2019s lawyer filed the petition, he was detained\u00a0in New Jersey, not New York.",
      "The judge's order barring the government from deporting Khalil remains in effect and it will be up to the New Jersey federal court to consider Khalil\u2019s claims \u2014\u00a0including a motion to transfer him from Louisiana to a New York detention facility; a motion for release on bail; and a motion for preliminary injunctive relief that Khalil's legal camp filed Monday.",
      "\"In many ways, this is indeed an exceptional case, and there is a need for careful judicial review,\" Furman said. \"Such judicial review is especially critical when, as here, there are colorable claims that the Executive Branch has violated the law or exercised its otherwise lawful authority in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.\"",
      "Brett Max Kaufman, a member of Khalil's legal team, said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe court\u2019s ruling sends a critical message to courts across the country ... no judicial role is more important than acting as a check on executive abuses the Trump administration has made the defining feature of its first 60 days. After this first step, we will eagerly and aggressively seek to get Mahmoud out, bring him home, and then defend his and others\u2019 right to speak freely about Palestine or any other issue without fear of detention and deportation.\u201d",
      "In the letter, Khalil described himself as a \"political prisoner,\" detailed the facility's sordid conditions and\u00a0decried Israel's renewed offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Who has the right to have rights? It is certainly not the humans crowded into the cells here. It isn\u2019t the Senegalese man I met who has been deprived of his liberty for a year, his legal situation in limbo, and his family an ocean away. It isn\u2019t the 21-year-old detainee I met, who stepped foot in this country at age nine, only to be deported without so much as a hearing,\u201d he said. \"Justice escapes the contours of this nation\u2019s immigration facilities.\"",
      "He also described his arrest at his Columbia University-owned residence, recalling how Department of Homeland Security agents refused to provide a warrant and \"accosted my wife and me as we returned from dinner.\"",
      "He said he was handcuffed and forced into an unmarked car.",
      "\"At that moment, my only concern was for Noor\u2019s safety,\" he said in the letter about his wife, who is eight months pregnant. \u201cI had no idea if she would be taken too, since the agents had threatened to arrest her for not leaving my side.\u201d",
      "Khalil said that after his arrest, he was transported to a facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he slept on the ground and was denied a blanket.",
      "\"My arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza, which resumed in full force Monday night,\" he said. \"With January\u2019s ceasefire now broken, parents in Gaza are once again cradling too-small shrouds, and families are forced to weigh starvation and displacement against bombs. It is our moral imperative to persist in the struggle for their complete freedom.\"",
      "DHS has previously said in a statement about Khalil\u2019s arrest that he had \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged Khalil organized protests that disrupted the campus, harassed Jewish American students and distributed pro-Hamas propaganda. A lawyer for Khalil, Samah Sisay, rejected the Trump administration\u2019s claim, saying there is no evidence that Khalil provided support of any kind to a terrorist organization.",
      "In the letter, Khalil also described his background, noting that he was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria after his family was displaced in the 1948 Nakba.",
      "\"I spent my youth in proximity to yet distant from my homeland,\" he said. \"But being Palestinian is an experience that transcends borders. I see in my circumstances similarities to Israel\u2019s use of administrative detention \u2014 imprisonment without trial or charge \u2014 to strip Palestinians of their rights. \u2026\u00a0For Palestinians, imprisonment without due process is commonplace.\"",
      "Khalil said he believes his arrest was indicative of \"anti-Palestinian racism\" demonstrated by \"both the Biden and Trump administrations\" over \"the past 16 months as the U.S. has continued to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians and prevented international intervention.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent. Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs,\" Khalil warned.",
      "He then urged people to rally together to defend the Palestinian people.",
      "\"In the weeks ahead, students, advocates, and elected officials must unite to defend the right to protest for Palestine. At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all,\" he said.",
      "Khalil concluded his letter by saying, \"I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.\""

The Huskies have struggled against dominant guards this seasons and the Sooners have just that in freshman star Jeremiah Fears (17.0 points, 4.1 assists and 4.1 rebounds per game).",
      "Oklahoma went 5-9 over the last 14 games, but eight of those losses came against NCAA Tournament teams. In fact, 12 of Oklahoma\u2019s 13 losses on the season have come against teams in the field of 68 and SEC opponents (Oklahoma went 13-0 in nonconference play). UConn has struggled to defend the 3-pointer (ranking 257th in the country at just 35.1%) and doesn\u2019t force turnovers (15.5% ranks 291st). It\u2019s also a known fact that the Big East is down this year, ranking fourth per Kenpom of all the major conferences after finishing second last year and third in 2023.",

UCLA hasn\u2019t played a defense like Utah State\u2019s, and the Bruins rank outside the top 150 in offensive and defensive effective field goal percentage over the past 10 games.",

      "The University of Pennsylvania did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The White House announcement follows an executive order signed last month by President Donald Trump prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing in female sports.",
      "The order, which referred to trans women as men, said having trans women and girls compete in women's sports \"is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.\"",
      "The order also stated that \"it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.\"",
      "Penn made national headlines in 2022 when a transgender student athlete, Lia Thomas, competed on the women's swim team and went on to become the first transgender woman to\u00a0win\u00a0an NCAA swimming championship.",
      "Thomas faced intense backlash, including repeated misgendering from conservative news outlets, some of which also posted pre-transition photos of her and used her deadname, meaning her legal name prior to transition.",

The San Jose State student has never publicly commented on the controversy or confirmed that she is transgender.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News that the Trump administration paused the funds due to Thomas' participation, referring to Thomas as male and condemning her access to the locker room. However, the official said the federal funding pause is not the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Education Department and that the funds were paused by the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.",
      "The official described the funding pause as an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The official did not clarify what the discretionary funding is for or why it was being paused if not due to an alleged Title IX violation.",
      "Trump's executive order barring trans girls and women from participating in women's sports rolled back Biden administration guidance that required schools to allow trans students to access school sports teams and sex-segregated facilities that align with their gender identities.\u00a0The order tasked the Education Department with investigating potential violations.",
      "White House officials told reporters at the time that the administration also planned to work with sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee, to ensure the guidance is followed in noneducational settings.",
      "Last month, a judge allowed two trans students who filed a lawsuit against New Hampshire's law prohibiting trans girls from playing on female sports teams to expand their challenge to also include Trump's executive order.",
      "A federal judge in New Hampshire ruled last fall that the two girls could try out for their high school soccer and tennis teams while their lawsuit proceeds.",
      "\u201cI love playing soccer and we had a great season last fall,\u201d one of the plaintiffs, Parker Tirrell, who is in 10th grade, said in a statement last month. \u201cI just want to go to school like other kids and keep playing the game I love.\u201d",
      "Chris Erchull, a senior staff attorney at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, one of the groups representing the teens, said the Trump administration's executive orders targeting trans people \"amount to a coordinated campaign to prevent transgender people from functioning in society.\"",
      "\u201cThe systematic targeting of transgender people across American institutions is chilling, but targeting young people in schools, denying them support and essential opportunities during their most vulnerable years, is especially cruel,\u201d\u00a0Erchull said in a statement last month. \u201cSchool sports are an important part of education\u2014something no child should be denied simply because of who they are. Our clients Parker and Iris simply want to go to school, learn, and play on teams with their peers.\u201d",
      "In addition to his order pertaining to trans student athletes, Trump signed an order proclaiming that the\u00a0government will recognize only two unchangeable sexes. He also signed orders\u00a0barring trans people from serving openly in the military\u00a0and\u00a0restricting access to gender-affirming care\u00a0for trans people younger than 19 nationwide. The last two orders have been temporarily blocked by courts."

      "In the March 6 incident, a man walked into the credit union,  handed a teller a note and said, \"This is a robbery,\" according to Willard. The man asked for \"big bills\" before fleeing in a \"black crossover vehicle, possible a Mercedes sedan,\" with $10,169, the complaint continued.",
      "Fingerprints lifted from the credit union's front door matched that of Sykes, who drives a black Mercedes sedan, authorities said",
      "Then six days later, a man walked into the Chase location and gave a teller \"a withdraw slip, which stated, 'Give me all the money ... I have a gun ... I will kill everyone in here,\" the complaint stated.",

      "Sykes, who is known to frequent the MGM Grand Detroit,\u00a0was nearly arrested on March 12 near that casino, officials said.",
      "Cell phone pings placed him near MGM that night but when law enforcement moved in on Sykes, he sped away in a Rolls Royce SUV and remained free until his arrest on Tuesday, police said.",
      "Sykes made his initial appearance before a judge Tuesday and asked to represent himself in court.",
      "Before his release from prison, Sykes had been serving time for two robberies he pulled Aug. 12, 2019. He hit a Citizen's Bank in Warren, getting away with $1,220, before knocking off a Comerica Bank in Oak Park and fleeing with $810.",
      "Those robberies happened \"just six weeks after being released from a 17-year prison sentence for the same type of behavior\" as he was \"on federal supervised release when he committed those crimes,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Frances Carlson wrote in a 2020 sentencing memo, asking for a 71-month sentence.",

Garvin.",
      "The suit says that the \"attacks culminated in the literal trespass and takeover by force by Defendants, including representatives of DOGE, of the Institute\u2019s headquarters building on Constitution Avenue.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell swiftly set a hearing for 2 p.m. on Wednesday, after the lawsuit was filed late Tuesday. The defendants are seeking a temporary restraining order, with USIP lawyers writing that defendants \u201cblatantly violate the plain terms of the USIP Act,\" which established the non-profit in 1984. They continue: \"Defendants have been and are at this minute engaged in conduct that will cause the Institute irreparable harm that will prevent the Institute from performing any of its lawful functions and is likely to utterly destroy it.\"",
      "Immediate intervention, attorneys wrote, \"is appropriate to stop the ongoing destruction of the Institute\u2019s physical and electronic property until the Court can further consider the merits.\"",

      "The lawsuit is part of a growing collection of court actions brought by members of different independent agencies in response to attempted takeovers by the Trump administration. The administration has argued the actions are an attempt to rein in \"so-called independent agencies,\" after Trump signed an executive order an order declaring that under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, all executive branch officials and employees fall under his supervision.",

Its main building is owned by an independent nonprofit corporation and was constructed from \"private gifts and contributions,\" according to the suit.",
      "USIP outside counsel told members of DOGE on March 9 that \"unauthorized personnel would only be admitted with a valid warrant issued by a court,\" according to the suit.",
      "In a declaration, USIP Chief Security Officer Colin O'Brien said that FBI Special Agent Doug Silk called him on Sunday and said O'Brien was subject to an investigation by the Justice Department after DOGE was denied access to the USIP building on Friday. O'Brien then informed USIP President Moose and the USIP outside counsel, according to the declaration.",

      "O'Brien said that when police arrived at the building around 5:30 p.m. on Monday, that he allowed a police commander and deputy captain into the building, as well as a patrol officer. When another officer arrived, that officer was allowed in but refused to close the door. Other officers came in behind them, along with representatives of DOGE and Jackson.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Ohio\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked from being enforced, a three-judge panel of appellate judges ruled Tuesday. The law also banned trans women and girls from participating in female sports.",
      "The state attorney general vowed an immediate appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, the state\u2019s 10th District Court of Appeals reversed the decision made last summer to allow the law to go into effect after a judge found it \u201creasonably limits parents\u2019 rights.\u201d The law bans counseling, gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for minors, unless they are already receiving such therapies and a doctor deems it risky to stop.",
      "The litigation was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but specifically discriminates against them accessing it.",
      "The court agreed and cited a number of flaws in the lower court\u2019s reasoning.",
      "She said that the Ohio law does not outlaw identical drugs when they\u2019re used for other reasons, only when they\u2019re used for gender transitioning, which makes it discriminatory. She also said that a prescription ban is not a reasonable exercise of the state\u2019s power when it is weighed against the rights of parents to care for their children.",
      "Addressing proponents\u2019 arguments that minors are not in a position to understand the long-term impacts such procedures could have on their lives, the judge said that, while they may not be, their parents are.",
      "\u201cThus, in considering whether the H.B. 68 ban is reasonable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the law recognizes the maturity, experience, and capacity of parents to make difficult judgments and act in their children\u2019s best interest,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The ACLU called the ruling \u201chistoric.\u201d",

      "Tuesday\u2019s ruling marked the second blow for the legislation.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the law in December 2023, after touring the state to visit children\u2019s hospitals and talking to families of children with gender dysphoria. He cast his action as thoughtful, limited and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 citing the suicide risks associated with minors who don\u2019t get proper treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "DeWine simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban gender-affirming surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. He hoped the move would allay concerns of fellow Republicans at the Ohio Statehouse, but the administration swiftly backed off that plan after transgender adults raised serious concerns about how state regulations could impact their lives and health.",
      "Ohio lawmakers stood their ground on the bill, easily overriding his veto \u2014 making Ohio the 23rd state to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a candidate to succeed DeWine next year, quickly released a statement saying that he will appeal Tuesday\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a no-brainer \u2014 we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children.\u201d",
      "Levenson acknowledged Tuesday that it\u2019s likely not the end of the legal dispute, but said her organization remained \u201cfervently committed\u201d to preventing the bill from ever taking effect again."

      "Speaking to TODAY.com, creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins confirmed the show was not in touch with the real people depicted, \u201cwhich made having the copious amounts of research that we have that much more essential,\u201d she said.",
      "The series drew from Facebook messages, text messages, depositions, medical records and adoption records, Robbins says. \u201cI can\u2019t even describe how many documents we were looking through,\u201d she says.",
      "The goal was not to make a \u201cdocumentary version\" of the story, Robbins says, because that exists elsewhere. Rather, she wanted to make \u201cthe most emotionally authentic version of this story,\u201d which required drawing from research and identifying places \u201cthat we need to slightly heighten or embellish or adjust to create a compelling narrative story.\u201d",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the real story of Natalia Grace, what her former adoptive parents were charged with, and where she is now.",
      "Who is Natalia Grace?",
      "Natalia Grace is originally from Ukraine and came to the United States in 2008 when she was adopted by a New Hampshire couple.",
      "Her Ukrainian adoption paperwork stated she was born in 2003, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace was born with a form of dwarfism called diastrophic dysplasia, according to the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana. This condition can affect bone growth and cause severe skeletal abnormalities, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.",
      "In 2010, the New Hampshire couple who originally adopted Grace put her up for re-adoption, per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals. She was then adopted by Indiana couple Kristine and Michael Barnett, who have three biological children.",
      "Soon after the adoption, the Barnetts have said they began to suspect that Grace was not a little girl, but an adult.",
      "Grace\u2019s age has been a point of contention. She has maintained that she was a child when she was adopted. In a season of \u201cNatalia Speaks,\u201d a DNA test suggested that Grace\u2019s age was \u201ccloser to 22\u201d at the time of filming, which made her 7 years old when she was adopted, according to the series.",
      "Over the next two years, the Barnetts had Grace medically and psychologically tested. In 2012, the couple successfully filed a petition for a court order to change Grace\u2019s birth year from 2003 to 1989, \u201cbased on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and social worker,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals.",
      "In 2013, the Barnetts moved Grace into her own apartment in Hamilton County, Indiana and \u201cassisted Natalia in obtaining federal disability benefits and supportive services to help her transition to life as an adult,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals. They then moved her into an apartment in Tippecanoe County, then moved to Canada with their biological children.",
      "Soon after moving to Tippecanoe County, Grace met Antwon and Cynthia Mans, and moved in with them, per the Indiana Court of Appeals filing.",
      "In March 2016, Antwon and Cynthia Mans filed a petition seeking guardianship of Grace, according to court documents. She was eventually adopted by them in 2023.",
      "Six months after the adoption, the Manses expressed concerns about Grace in a recorded call to the producers of \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething ain\u2019t right with Natalia,\u201d Antwon Mans said in the call, which was included in the docuseries. \u201cThis girl is tweakin.\u2019 I feel like she\u2019s the enemy in the house ... Made us look like we\u2019re the enemy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNatalia does not have emotions for nothing but herself,\u201d Antwon Mans also said on the call, as seen in the series. \u201cWe\u2019re done. We\u2019re done with her.\u201d",
      "Grace eventually left the Manses\u2019 home with the help of the family she lives with now, Nicole and Vincent DePaul, a New York couple with dwarfism. In the final chapter of the Investigation Discovery docuseries, which came out in January 2025, Grace is shown living apparently happily with the DePauls.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood \u2014 I had my childhood ripped from me,\u201d Grace said in the docuseries. She added, \u201cI left the nest to explore. It feels really good to know that, yeah, I can actually do this.\u201d",
      "What happened between Natalia Grace and the Barnetts?",
      "Soon after adopting Grace, the Barnetts began to believe she had malicious intentions toward them, Michael Barnett said in \u201cThe Curious Grace of Natalia Grace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t put into words the everyday abject horror that we had to go through and live with,\u201d he said in the documentary.",
      "The couple alleged that they once woke up to find Grace standing by their bed with a knife, a story Grace has denied.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d she said in the documentary. \u201cI\u2019m an 8-year-old, 37-pound little girl ... I never tried to murder anybody.\u201d",
      "While the Barnetts initially said they believed Grace was an adult, Michael Barnett admitted they knew medical professionals had determined she was a minor at the time of her adoption, according to a 2019 affidavit of probable cause filed in the County of Tippecanoe in Indiana.",
      "According to the same affidavit, Grace was examined at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital in 2010 and her age was determined to be approximately 8. Two years later, she had a skeletal survey at the same hospital and her age was estimated as 11.",
      "Michael Barnett later admitted that he and his wife \u201cwere aware\u201d doctors had \u201cdetermined Natalia was a minor child\u201d when they left her alone in an apartment in 2013 and moved to Canada with their biological children, according to the affidavit.",
      "Barnett also said his wife \u201ctold Natalia to tell others Natalia looks young but was actually 22,\u201d the affidavit states.",
      "Kristine Barnett did not participate in the docuseries or respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a since-deleted Facebook post, Kristine Barnett called the docuseries \u201chighly sensationalized\u201d and said Grace had been \u201ca very much loved and cared for member of our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that these false allegations are occurring after a trial with evidence which was dismissed is disturbing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like being assumed guilty after being proven innocent.\u201d",
      "What charges did the Barnetts face?",
      "In September 2019, Michael and Kristine Barnett were each charged with six counts of neglect of a dependent and two counts of conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent.",
      "In a convoluted legal battle spanning years, the Barnetts filed motions to dismiss the charges against them. Some of these motions were granted, but not all the charges were dismissed.",
      "In a 2021 document, the Court of Appeals of Indiana maintained that the Barnetts had \u201cengaged in numerous \u2018positive acts\u2019 to conceal their criminal neglect of Natalia.\u201d",
      "These acts, in part, included \u201cchanging Natalia\u2019s age to conceal the illegality of abandoning her alone in an apartment and to repel others\u2019 efforts to intervene,\u201d as well \u201cfailing to disclose to the probate court the results of certain medical examinations and evaluations regarding Natalia\u2019s age.\u201d",
      "The court also maintained that regardless of Grace\u2019s age, the State of Indiana could proceed with certain counts against the Barnetts under \u201cthe theory that Natalia was a dependent because of a physical disability.\u201d",
      "Michael Barnett was found not guilty of the charges against him in October 2022, and the charges against Kristine Barnett were dismissed in March 2023, according to the Lafayette Journal & Courier.",
      "Grace and the Barnetts have continued to share differing accounts of their time together.",
      "Grace has alleged that the Barnetts abused her and made her lie about her age, and she has denied their claims that she physically threatened them.",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to defend myself and be like, \u2018Do I look like somebody that could push someone twice my size into a fence? Do I look like I could even grip a knife?\u2019\u201d she told People in January.",
      "\u201cI feel like I was brainwashed by the Barnetts,\u201d she continued. \u201cKristine coached me to lie about my age and say I tried to murder my parents. Why would you do that to your child?\u201d",
      "In a charged conversation with Grace in the docuseries in 2023, Michael Barnett alleged that Kristine had abused him as well, and said he and Grace were both victims in the situation.",
      "Michael and Kristine Barnett divorced in 2014, per NBC News.",
      "\u201cI had the same monster you did. I was exceptionally controlled and put down and threatened, was minimalized,\u201d he said. \u201cWho I was was ripped from me, and I was guided and instructed to be exactly what she wanted me to be.",
      "Where is Natalia Grace now?",
      "As of January 2025, Grace is living with Nicole and Vincent DePaul in upstate New York.",
      "Nicole DePaul defended Grace in a recent People cover story, challenging the Barnetts\u2019 previous claims about Grace\u2019s behavior.",
      "\u201cDid she probably do weird things in the past? Yeah,\u201d DePaul told People. \u201c(But) when you take in a child, you take that child as your own. You don\u2019t just get rid of them when they don\u2019t fit into your puzzle.\u201d",
      "DePaul also said Grace experiences anxiety and has ADHD and PTSD.",
      "According to Grace's interview with People, she was studying for her GED, learning to drive, and earning her own money.",
      "Grace has also said she is in a happy romantic relationship with a U.K.-based boyfriend called Neil.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a big learning curve for me. For the most part, I\u2019ve made peace. It is definitely a blessing to be alive today,\u201d Grace told People. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing I can do to change the past.\u201d"

      "\u201cYes, he is my long-lost cousin,\u201d she said while appearing on the 3rd hour of TODAY on March 18.",
      "\u201cI could not believe it,\u201d she added.",
      "Messing, who stars alongside Robert De Niro in the upcoming film \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d says she also had to do some digging to find out if her Sanders connection meant she was related to Larry David.",
      "David and Sanders learned they are distant cousins on a 2017 episode of \u201cFinding Your Roots,\u201d so Messing said her son, Roman, was curious about any possible family relation on their side of the family.",
      "\u201cMy son, when I came home, he said, \u2018You know, there was another show where Larry David found out that he was related to Bernie Sanders. So does that mean we\u2019re related to Larry David?\u2019 Because my son is really into comedy and loves Larry David,\u201d Messing recalled.",

      "Jack Edwards, a British YouTuber with nearly 1.5 million subscribers watching his content about books, posted a TikTok earlier this month about the books in \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d and what they could signify for the characters who are reading them.",

      "\u201cWhile it\u2019s not necessary to know what the books are or what they represent, it is added texture,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cThey\u2019re fun Easter eggs that give us an added insight into the characters that if you\u2019re eagl-eyed enough to spot \u2014 it\u2019s quite a thrilling experience to be able to hunt them down.\u201d",
      "Edwards has made other videos about the seeming intentionality of the books characters are reading in \"White Lotus\" Seasons 1 and 2.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s something quite pleasant and satisfactory about having to linger on a show like this, where it\u2019s being rolled out weekly,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI think maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing so many theories and so much debate around what could possibly happen.\u201d",

      "Edwards says the scene represents the difference between the two brothers. Even though they are siblings and had almost identical educations, one values reading and the other does not.",
      "\u201cOne of those characters wants to learn, is inquisitive, and the other one is the sort of nepo baby figure who has had everything handed to him on a plate,\u201d he says. \u201cSo even there, I think we can see a different dynamic in who is reading and who isn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In the scene, Lochlan holds up the book, which Edwards says he watched frame by frame, trying to get a clear shot of the book. He  ultimately identified the cover as an Oxford World's Classics edition.",
      "\u201cSo I Googled, \u2018How many Oxford World\u2019s Classics are there?\u2019 and it was, like, a horror movie sound effect when I realized there were 929. But I am nothing if not committed to the bit, and I scrolled through them,\u201d he says, noting there is a full Oxford archive online.",
      "On the penultimate page, Edwards finally spotted one that looked familiar: \u201cHunger\u201d by Knut Hamsun.",
      "According to the book\u2019s description, \u201cHunger\u201d follows an aspiring writer as he tries to make ends meet in the city. The narrative becomes blurred as the voice of the narrator shifts between a level assessment of his situation and wild outbursts of anger and despair.",
      "\u201cWhen I was looking into it, it\u2019s about a young man who was trying to establish himself, but he does so with unease and sensitivity,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cAnd when I then thought about Lochlan\u2019s character, I was like, well, that completely adds up for who he is.\u201d",

As we\u2019re seeing it, it\u2019s the Full Moon Party in Thailand right now \u2014 it\u2019s a festival \u2014 and no one seems to be engaging with it at all, whereas Belinda is much more aware of her surroundings and the social hierarchies of the space she\u2019s in.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can see that Belinda is much more self-aware than the rest of the characters about their kind of social status and where they exist within the hierarchy,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo I thought that was interesting, that she\u2019s reading \u2018Surrounded by Narcissists,\u2019 and it feels like a fun commentary for the people who notice.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe Beautiful and the Damned\u201d is widely believed to have been based on Fitzgerald\u2019s relationship with his wife Zelda Fitzgerald. The book follows a 25-year-old Harvard graduate who falls deeply in love and enters into a reckless marriage. The pair live a life of decadence, thinking they will receive inheritance money, but their lifestyle ultimately leads to their ruin and the end of their marriage.",
      "\u201cThat book is about success and money and wealth and how relationships survive in times of difficulty,\u201d he says.",
      "The book is also about substance abuse \u2014 specifically alcoholism. \"I think we\u2019re seeing substance abuse being referenced a little bit more in the show. But again, it feels very deliberate,\" Edwards says.",
      "Chelsea's book",

Give us another shot on the other side this time, please!\u2019 But I feel like they drip feed them throughout the series, so hopefully, next episode,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want you to know if they show a clip of her reading that book from the front, just know I\u2019m jumping for joy at home.\u201d",
      "Some Reddit users have hypothesized the book could be \u201cStart Where You Are: How to Accept Yourself and Others\u201d by Pema Chodron due to its light purple cover, but it is unclear if it\u2019s the exact book Chelsea is reading at this point in the season.",
      "According to the book's description, readers work with slogans and meditation practices to work on their inner pain and discover joy.",
      "Piper's book",
      "Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) can be seen reading a book called \"The Loving Kindness\" in the third season as well, though Edwards thinks it may be a book created specifically for her character.",
      "In Episode 5, Piper reveals to her parents that she didn't actually want to go to Thailand to write her thesis \u2014 it's because she wants to move to the country to study under a monk.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s a fake book, and that it\u2019s meant to be the monk that she\u2019s studying,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI think it's interesting that she\u2019s more willing to engage in text. It\u2019s more palatable when it\u2019s a book rather than the actual person who could challenge her.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "We know the story of Katniss Everdeen's time in the arena. Now, Suzanne Collins is telling the tale of how Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, survived the Hunger Games \u2014 more than 20 years before Katniss' story begins.",
      "In \"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" the fifth book in the \"Hunger Games\" franchise, Collins chronicles the events of the 50th Hunger Games. The annual event sees children from the districts in the dystopian country of Panem fight to the death as entertainment for its Capitol \u2014\u00a0a punishment for a decades-old rebellion.",
      "The first \"Hunger Games\" book, which was published in 2008, follows the events of the 74th Hunger Games, when 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12 famously volunteered as tribute in her sister's place. The next two books in the series see her become a reluctant leader of a districtwide rebellion against the Capitol and face off against Panem's dictatorial president, Coriolanus Snow.",
      "Collins returned to Panem in 2020 with the book \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\" which tells Snow's villain origin story against the backdrop of the 10th annual Hunger Games. It details how he turned the Games into a spectacle while mentoring District 12 tribute Lucy Gray Baird.",
      "\"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" out March 18, is Collins' second spinoff book of the \"Hunger Games\" trilogy.",
      "Here's what to remember before returning to the world of Panem.",
      "Who is Haymitch Abernathy?",
      "Haymitch Abernathy is introduced in the first \"Hunger Games\" book as the drunken mentor of Katniss and her male tribute counterpart, Peeta Mellark. As the only surviving victor from District 12, Haymitch is tasked with preparing Katniss and Peeta for the Games.",
      "In the first book, he travels with them to the Capitol, but he spends most of his time drinking. After Katniss fights back against his perceived indifference, he realizes her potential to succeed in the Games, and he helps Katniss and Peeta strategize.",
      "During the Games, he's also responsible for sending resources, including water and medicine, bought by sponsors to his tributes in the arena.",
      "While mentoring Katniss and Peeta, he gradually reveals things about his own traumatic experience in the 50th Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.",
      "What is a Quarter Quell?",
      "A Quarter Quell is a special version of the Hunger Games that comes around every 25 years. Each Quarter Quell brings a different twist. For Haymitch's Games, there were double the amount of tributes, making him one of four tributes reaped from District 12.",
      "The second \"Hunger Games\" book, \"Catching Fire,\" follows the third Quarter Quell, or the 75th Hunger Games. This time around, tributes were reaped from the pool of surviving victors. For District 12, that pool consists of Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch, guaranteeing the trilogy's heroine would go back into the arena. While Haymitch was named the male tribute by the luck of the draw, Peeta immediately volunteers to take his place.",
      "During \"Catching Fire,\" Haymitch again serves as Katniss and Peeta's mentor. But in the background, he also coordinates with District 13's underground resistance effort and undercover rebel Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee to rescue tributes from the arena.",
      "At the end of the book, Katniss finally learns of the conspiracy to start a second rebellion from Haymitch. In \"Mockingjay,\" he serves as one of the rebellion's leaders, providing unconditional support to Katniss as conflict between her and District 13's President Coin emerges.",
      "What happened during the 50th Hunger Games?",
      "Well, we're about to find out.",
      "The book's synopsis teases what's ahead for Haymitch.",
      "\"Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances,\" it reads. \"All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves. When Haymitch\u2019s name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He\u2019s torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who\u2019s nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he\u2019s been set up to fail. But there\u2019s something in him that wants to fight ... and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena.\"",
      "Notably, the first three books allude to significant moments from Haymitch\u2019s time in the arena. In \"Catching Fire,\" Katniss and Peeta even watch tape from the 50th Hunger Games to prepare for the Third Quarter Quell.",
      "We learn that one of the female tributes from District 12 was a girl named Maysilee Donner, and she and Haymitch form an alliance at some point in the Games.",
      "Haymitch spends much of the Games exploring the edge of the arena, trying to see what lies at the end of it. When he finally reaches the edge, he finds a force field. That force field becomes his saving grace. He ultimately wins the Games after the only other remaining tribute throws an ax toward him and the edge of the arena \u2014 only for the weapon to rebound and kill her.",
      "After his time in the arena, we know his family and girlfriend are murdered by President Snow for his perceived defiance. He turns to alcohol to cope with the trauma and the consistent loss of the tributes he mentors in the Games until Katniss and Peeta's turn.",
      "At the end of \"Mockingjay,\" he returns to District 12 with Katniss and Peeta and takes up raising geese as the country of Panem rebuilds."

      "In a long phone call with Trump on Tuesday, Putin declined to endorse a 30-day ceasefire endorsed by Trump and accepted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But, according to a Kremlin readout of their conversation Tuesday, Putin did agree \u201cto mutually refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days.\u201d",
      "This differed slightly from Trump's post on Truth Social and a White House readout which said Russia had agreed to an \u201cenergy and infrastructure\u201d ceasefire.",
      "Zelenskyy, who had accepted a U.S. proposal for a complete ceasefire, said he would speak to Trump on Wednesday.",
      "Later in the morning, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he and Zelenskyy had a \"very good telephone call,\" which lasted about an hour. Trump said much of their discussion was \"based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.\"",
      "\"We are very much on track, and I will ask Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to give an accurate description of the points discussed,\" Trump wrote, adding that a statement would be released shortly.",

These came, he said, after Putin \u201cgave the order\u201d to stop attacking Ukraine\u2019s \u201cenergy sector.\u201d",
      "In earlier comments late Tuesday, Zelenskyy said Russia fired dozens of Iranian-made Shahed drones at \u201ccivilian infrastructure\u201d in several regions across Ukraine and that one had hit a hospital in the city of Sumy, in the country\u2019s northeast.",
      "\u201cIt is precisely such night attacks by Russia that destroy our energy, our infrastructure, the normal life of Ukrainians,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cAnd the fact that this night was no exception shows that we must continue to put pressure on Russia for the sake of peace.\u201d",
      "UkrZaliznytsia, Ukraine\u2019s national railway company, said Wednesday that Russia \u201cstruck the railway power system\u201d in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region with drones.",
      "Ukraine's air force said that it shot down 72 drones overnight and that Russia had also launched at least two ballistic missiles.",

      "\u201cThe pipeline between the tanks was damaged,\u201d the region\u2019s emergency headquarters said in a statement early Wednesday. \u201cThe automatic fire extinguishing and cooling system was engaged,\u201d the statement read, adding there were no casualties.",
      "Later, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine of trying to sabotage the agreements made by Trump and Putin with the attacks on Krasnodar. He added that the leaders understood each other."

      "The second phase was set to kick in 16 days later and would have included the exchange of all the remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire. In phase three, the bodies of all dead hostages were to be returned and a commitment made to rebuild Gaza."

      "Spanning different periods of the Spanish painter and sculptor\u2019s life, the new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMoCA) comprises 26 iconic works including \u201cPortrait of a Man,\u201d \u201cCry of War\u201d and \u201cEcho of Sorrow.\u201d",

Twelve of the 26 aquatint prints from \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d a rare portfolio he produced in 1957, showcase his deep fascination with bullfighting culture in Spain.",

      "The parents of missing University of Pittsburgh student\u00a0Sudiksha Konanki said on Tuesday that they've given up hope that their daughter is still alive and believe she drowned while on a spring break trip in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Konanki, 20, went missing while on a trip with five friends in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. She is believed to have been last seen on the beach in the early hours of March 6 before she vanished.",
      "A weeks-long international investigation into her disappearance has largely come up short of answers. Addressing reporters outside of their home in Loudoun County, Virginia, Konanki\u2019s parents said that drowning is the explanation for her disappearance.",
      "\"We are coming to terms with the fact that our daughter has drowned,\" Konanki's father, Subbarayudu Konanki, said through tears. \"This is incredibly difficult for us to process.\"",
      "Konanki's father said that U.S. and Dominican Republic authorities told the family that they also believe their daughter drowned, pointing to the ocean's conditions on the morning she disappeared.",
      "\"Both sides of the authorities have shown us how high the ocean waves were at the time of [the] incident,\" he said. \"And\u00a0both sides of the authorities also clarified that the person of interest is not suspect from the beginning.\"",
      "Konanki's father appeared to be referring to Joshua Riibe, an American who was the last person believed to have been seen with Konanki on the morning she disappeared.",
      "Riibe, a 22-year-old senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota,\u00a0told local authorities in an interview last week that he was on the beach with Konanki shortly before she disappeared, according to an interview transcript obtained by NBC News.",
      "According to the transcript, which NBC News translated from Spanish, he and Konanki were \"in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little\" before a wave crashed, taking them both \"out to sea.\"",
      "Although he has not been charged with a crime, Riibe and his attorneys said his passport has been confiscated by local authorities and that he has been kept under supervision at the hotel where Konanki disappeared since March 6.",
      "The Dominican Republic National Police said there are no suspects in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "A Dominican judge ruled on Tuesday that Riibe no longer needs to remain under police supervision. However, the judge said his courtroom was not the appropriate venue to resolve the matter of Riibe\u2019s passport.",
      "As Eduardo Vel\u00e1zquez, a prosecutor with the Dominican Republic AG\u2019s office, returned to the courtroom ahead of the judge\u2019s decision on Tuesday, NBC News asked him about Riibe\u2018s passport which prosecutors claim they do not have.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know the passport,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said. When pressed for answers, he responded \u2014 in English: \"I don\u2019t speak Spanish... er English sorry.\"",
      "Konanki's mother appeared to be too grief-stricken to speak at length on Tuesday, but thanked the international media for its \"help and cooperation.\"",
      "\"We were going through too much pain all these days and we were saddened and we were not able to believe this,\" Konanki's father said. \"Sorry, I cannot, I\u2019m not able to speak anything on that because our heart is broken.\"",

It is unclear why De Jesus was detained; his family believes it may have been because of his tattoos.",
      "\u201cThey detained him just because he has tattoos,\u201d De Jesus\u2019 sister said. \u201cFrom the beginning, they asked constantly about his tattoos. They would ask him if he was a member of the criminal gang, Tren de Aragua, and he always said no.\u201d",
      "She said none of her brother's tattoos are gang-affiliated. Some of the more prominent ones include rose art on his neck and arm, an angel on his chest and a tattoo that says \u201cmom\u201d on his chest.",
      "De Jesus had left Venezuela because \u201ccolectivos,\u201d armed paramilitary groups that support President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, were harassing and extorting him, his sister said.",
      "Joseph Giardina, an attorney based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who is representing De Jesus in his asylum case, was stunned to learn his client had been deported to El Salvador. The final hearing in his asylum case was scheduled for April 10.",
      "When Giardina heard De Jesus had been deported, he checked online and saw that his asylum hearing was still pending. He thought there must have been a mix-up.",
      "\u201cWith a pending asylum application and a trial, that would make absolutely no sense,\u201d Giardina said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for years. That\u2019s not how it works.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has been in proceedings for months. The government has never filed an I-213, which would indicate any criminal background. They have never filed any evidence of any kind of criminal history,\u201d Giardina said.",
      "Mirelys Casique told Telemundo her family recognized her son, Francisco Garc\u00eda Casique, in a photo released by the government of El Salvador. She said that while the man in the image was looking down, the family was able to identify him because of his tattoos.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not a criminal. He has no criminal record,\u201d she said, adding that if the government was going to deport her son, \u201cthey should send him back to his country of origin.\u201d",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act this weekend, and on Saturday, a federal judge issued a restraining order blocking him from using it to justify the deportations and ordered any planes that were already in the air to turn around.",
      "In court documents, officials said three planes left the United States after Trump issued his proclamation, raising questions about the timing of the flights and the custody handover.",
      "A federal judge reviewing the case Tuesday asked the administration for further details about the flights and which immigrants were deported solely based on the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Venezuelan government has since publicly condemned the detention of its citizens in El Salvador and issued a travel warning to those in the United States and those planning to travel abroad.",
      "\u201cWe are calling on the international community to stay alert against these practices that serve against human dignity and the principles of international rights,\u201d Venezuela\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement Monday."

      "The ruling is a partial victory for Joshua Riibe, 22, a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, who has said he has been kept in a hotel room and not allowed to leave without supervision since Konanki vanished.",

      "The measure passed in a 136-27 vote. The law, supported by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted only a day earlier.",
      "It amends Hungary\u2019s law on assembly to make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation, which prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors under 18.",
      "Attending a prohibited event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546), which the state must forward to \u201cchild protection,\u201d according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify individuals attending a prohibited event.",
      "As the vote was held in Hungary\u2019s parliament in Budapest, opposition lawmakers ignited smoke bombs in the chamber, filling it with thick plumes of colorful smoke.",

      "\u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism,\u201d organizers wrote. \u201cThe government is trying to restrict peaceful protests with a critical voice by targeting a minority. Therefore, as a movement, we will fight for the freedom of all Hungarians to demonstrate!\u201d",
      "The new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ people taken by Orb\u00e1n, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.",
      "In 2022, the European Union\u2019s executive commission filed a case with the EU\u2019s highest court against Hungary\u2019s 2021 child protection law. The European Commission argued that the law \u201cdiscriminates against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d",
      "Hungary\u2019s government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilization from what it calls \u201cgender madness,\u201d and argues that its policies are designed to protect children from \u201csexual propaganda.\u201d",
      "Hungary\u2019s \u201cchild protection\u201d law \u2014 aside from banning the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality in content available to minors, including in television, films, advertisements and literature \u2014 also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of \u201cgender deviating from sex at birth.\u201d",
