      "As The Associated Press\u2019 music writer, Maria Sherman has seen more than 80 concerts in 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- As The Associated Press\u2019 music writer, Maria Sherman has seen more than 80 concerts in 2024. Here are some of her picks for the best and biggest shows of the year. Most shows on this list were seen in the New York metropolitan area \u2014 unless otherwise noted \u2014 and it excludes most one-off performances that cannot be repeated. Take a look at where you too can catch these artists.",
      "Dec. 17, Barclays Center",
      "At the end of the year, when most massive pop tours come to an end, who else is there to take up the mantle but the Queen of Christmas, Mariah Carey? During her 2024 seasonal run, Carey performed holiday classics \u2014 both her own and the standards \u2014 and broke from the format just slightly to hit a medley of her biggest hits: \u201cEmotions,\u201d \u201cHero,\u201d \u201cFantasy\u201d and \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d among them.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: The closer of her enduring classic, \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d But for the final night of her tour in Brooklyn, there was an unexpected surprise \u2014 Rihanna was in the audience, and Carey signed her chest during an arena-wide sing-along of \u201cAlways Be My Baby.\u201d",
      "OPENER: Come on, like the Queen of Christmas needs an introduction.",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Carey's Christmas shows have become something of a yearly tradition, so just wait until 2025.",
      "Oct. 10, Carnegie Hall",
      "For the second time in her career, Natalia Lafourcade performed at Carnegie Hall, joined by Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. There was nothing stuffy about it \u2014 the crowd danced in the aisles as the four-time Grammy Award winner made the historic venue come alive with her Latin folk, rock, bossa nova and cumbia.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Near the end of the performance, Lafourcade was joined by Jon Batiste for an improvised set. Suddenly, the hallowed halls of Carnegie Hall felt intimate, like a private rehearsal.",
      "OPENER: None.",

      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Le\u00f3n has a few more dates scheduled for April 2025, including in Florida and North Carolina.",
      "Aug. 3, UBS Arena",
      "It is almost unbelievable: Before 2024, Missy Elliott had never headlined her own arena tour. And, the last tour she went on was in 2004, performing alongside Beyonc\u00e9 and Alicia Keys. Two decades later, the multihyphenate decided it was finally time to hit the road again for a true pop spectacle. And just like the title suggests, it was \u201cout of this world.\u201d",
      "HIGHLIGHT: She's one of the most influential artists of the last 30 years, so pick your favorite: \u201cGet Ur Freak On,\u201d \u201cWork It,\u201d \u201cLose Control\u201d \u2014 the show was nonstop, a high-energy explosion that felt more like a once-in-a-lifetime event than a concert.",
      "OPENER: Busta Rhymes and Ciara, Elliott's day one collaborators, joined for a show that felt like a party in outer space.",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: The tour has ended but catch Elliott at Coachella next spring.",
      "June 7-9, Flushing Meadows Corona Park",
      "Look, summer music festivals aren't for everyone. But every once in a while, an institution will surprise you, for not only actually booking the superstars of today, well, today \u2014 but also by featuring an eclectic mix of talent. This year, Governors Ball delivered.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Now is the time to run, don\u2019t walk, to see Chappell Roan. But you already knew that. You've had the \u201cHot to Go\u201d dance committed to memory for ages now.",
      "OPENER: Sexyy Red\u2019s raunchy rap is a feature of many playlists for a reason.",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Next June, back in New York.",

      "OPENER: Chris Stapleton and Little Big Town, with Stapleton joining Strait for their 2024 collaboration, \u201cHonky Tonk Hall of Fame.\u201d",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Strait doesn't have forthcoming shows scheduled but never say never.",
      "May 23, MetLife Stadium",
      "One of the greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands of all time plays two hours of nonstop hits, pulling from their 60-year discography and then some. What else could you ask for?",

      "April 5, Madison Square Garden",
      "Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s glossy pop-punk is for the all-ages crowd and felt deeply by all. If women performing their rage has fallen out of vogue, Rodrigo has brought it back, full force.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Honestly? Whatever your favorite Olivia Rodrigo song is!",
      "OPENER: The Breeders \u2014 fronted by the Pixies\u2019 Kim Deal \u2014 legends of \u201990s college radio and indie rock.",

      "Amy Allen might not yet be a household name, but her work lives in your brain rent free",
      "NEW YORK -- Amy Allen might not yet be a household name, but her work lives in your brain rent-free. And it's grabbed the attention of the Grammys.",
      "The 32-year-old songwriter has composed enduring hits with Halsey (\u201cWithout Me\u201d), Selena Gomez (\u201cBack to You\u201d) and Tate McRae (\u201cGreedy\u201d). Her contributions to Harry Styles' \u201cHarry's House\u201d earned her a Grammy for album of the year in 2023. Other credits include songs from Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX, Ros\u00e9, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Shawn Mendes, Leon Bridges and Justin Timberlake.",
      "2024, however, was the year Allen's work became inescapable \u2014 thanks in large part to her collaboration with another rising star. Allen co-wrote all 12 tracks of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s bubbly \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d including \u201cEspresso,\u201d an instant song of the summer that propelled Carpenter to a new stratosphere of stardom, and \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d the follow-up single that proved that her winking, quotable pop had staying power. (Everyone's favorite lyric? \u201cHeartbreak is one thing, my ego\u2019s another / I beg you, don\u2019t embarrass me,\u201d followed by a rhyming profanity rasped with a smirk.)",
      "This fall, Allen's work sent her to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 Songwriters chart for seven weeks \u2014 an impressive feat, considering her competition includes artists like Carpenter herself and Kendrick Lamar.",
      "\u201cOnce the songs are out of my hands, I just try to let them go to the world,\u201d Allen told The Associated Press. It helps that the world has, in turn, embraced them.",
      "When nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards were announced, Allen was in the midst of a writing session in London. The news came in a text from her manager: She was nominated four times, including her second nomination in the songwriter of the year, non-classical, category that has only existed for three years. If she wins, she will become the first woman to take home that trophy. \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d is up for album of the year and \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d for song of the year.",
      "Her fourth nod is in the song written for visual media category, for \u201cBetter Place,\u201d a collaboration with NSYNC for \u201cTrolls: Band Together.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople really gravitate toward her energy, as well as obviously her talent. That just goes without saying,\u201d said Julia Michaels, another hit songwriter, artist and collaborator on \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d of Allen.",
      "\u201cShe just always brings a happy, optimistic attitude, that like, \u2018anything is possible today,\u2019\u201d added Julian Bunetta, who also co-wrote and produced songs on Carpenter's album. \u201cThe ease of that makes conversation come natural, which makes people open up and share details about their life.\u201d",
      "Allen's path to professional songwriting wasn't necessarily linear. Growing up in Maine, she joined a bluegrass band, a rock band and played music at Irish pubs throughout her teens. It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s, when she transferred to Berklee College of Music after two years in nursing school at Boston College, that she realized being both a songwriter for others and a performing artist was a career option.",
      "\u201cI had to really dig to realize, like, Carole King writes for other people, but she\u2019s also an artist. And then it was later on, way later on, when I came across writers like Julia that were doing it professionally,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI knew that it was like in my blood since I was really little, that it made me feel more connected to myself and the world around me in so many ways, more than anything else I ever experienced.\u201d",
      "\u201cEspresso\u201d came together in a Paris studio. Allen, Bunetta, Carpenter and their co-writer Steph Jones \u201cwere kids having fun and laughing and playing,\u201d Bunetta said, explaining that joyful energy produced the track's cheery sound and nonsensical zingers (\u201cthat's that me espresso\u201d).",
      "Allen believes \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d found success through its quirky, playful pop \u2014 because listeners want unpredictability, narrative songs with personality and perspective.",
      "\u201cThe general public is so much smarter than a lot of songwriters and a lot of people in the entertainment industry, give them credit for,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe artists that are winning are the ones that are willing to put everything out there, to say something so direct and so honest to them and so authentic that it\u2019s almost impossible for the public to turn away.\u201d",
      "In October, she was out of the studio and on the road, opening for collaborator Jack Antonoff\u2019s band Bleachers on a slate of dates across Europe, Los Angeles and New York. She performed songs from \u201cAmy Allen,\u201d her self-titled debut album released in September \u2014 a collection of acoustic guitar melodies and percussion-led singer-songwriter pop.",
      "Touring those songs came with a realization. \u201cI love writing for other artists and with other artists, and I will do that for a very long time,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also so important for me to go back to how I fell in love with music, which was writing songs on my bed, writing little poems in my bedroom.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether she wants to be the biggest artist in the world or she wants to make whatever kind of music she makes, I have no doubt that she is capable of doing it,\u201d said Michaels, who launched her own pop career in 2017 with her multi-platinum song \u201cIssues.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to go after both,\u201d Allen said.",

      "The siblings behind the band The Black Crowes had just released their debut album \u201cShake Your Money Maker\u201d and were nominees for best new artist. They didn't have high hopes. Sure enough, Mariah Carey would take the crown.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t remember ever like getting too worked up about it,\u201d singer-songwriter Chris Robinson recalls. \u201cOf course, Mariah Carey is going to get that. Are they going to give it to these dirtbag kids from Atlanta who just came to the party really to get thrown out?\u201d",
      "Fast forward more than three decades and the Black Crowes have been invited back to the party, earning their second career Grammy nod this year for best rock album alongside the Rolling Stones.",
      "\u201cLiterally just to be nominated is an amazing thing. And to be nominated next to the Rolling Stones makes it even better,\u201d says Rich Robinson, the songwriter and guitarist.",
      "The Black Crowes' rollicking \"Happiness Bastards\" is up for best rock album against \u201cRomance\u201d by Fontaines D.C., \u201cSaviors\u201d by Green Day, \u201cTANGK\u201d by IDLES, \u201cDark Matter\u201d from Pearl Jam, \u201cHackney Diamonds\u201d by the Stones and \u201cNo Name\u201d from Jack White.",
      "\u201cTo be in a place where it\u2019s all clicking and it all feels right, that\u2019s the real special feeling,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cI think it reinforces our commitment and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappiness Bastards\u201d is a 10-track romping tour of rock, from the Southern boogie of \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d to the stuttering stomp of \u201cCross Your Fingers\u201d and the airy cool of \u201cWilted Rose.\u201d There's blues harmonica, some glam rock, '70s harmonies and fun AC/DC-like riffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funky and it\u2019s rockin' and it\u2019s kind of a little bit salty here and there. But ultimately, I think it\u2019s very interesting,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s just integrated with everything that we\u2019ve done and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",
      "The band last released a studio album in 2009, and the volatile Robinson brothers needed a decade apart before they regrouped in 2019. In 2022, they released an EP with covers of David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations, T. Rex, Little Feat and Rod Stewart. Now they're in the same Grammy category as the Stones.",
      "Critics have welcomed the brothers back, with Paste magazine calling the new album \u201ca respectable collection of bluesy rockers that showcase the brothers\u2019 strengths\u201d and Rolling Stone describing it as \u201cfun, energetic and, unmistakably not-crusty.\u201d",
      "Some cynics thought the reunion was simply a cash grab, an attempt to monetize fans of the band yearning for the '90s and a good-time rock concert. The strong album and Grammy love refutes that argument.",
      "\u201cWell, we did it and we\u2019ve been successful. And all these years later we wrote these new songs and, boom, here we are,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cThe validation of that is really unique to us.\u201d",
      "The way the brothers come up with a song hadn't changed over the years. During the pandemic, Rich started sending a flood of ideas to his brother to see what clicked with him.",
      "Chris wrote the lyrics for \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d in 20 minutes after Rich \u2014 inspired by AC/DC \u2014 sent him a killer riff. \u201cRich just handed me a hanging curveball. \u2018I can hit this,\u2019 you know what I mean?\u201d says Chris. \u201cI have to emphasize how much fun we\u2019re having in this band.\u201d",
      "One difference this time was the addition of an outside producer. The Robinson brothers had produced all The Black Crowes albums after their second and wanted a new element.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s bring in someone that\u2019s going to challenge us a little bit and maybe would have a point of view that we don\u2019t have.\u2019 Someone that can look at everything from 10,000 feet,\u201d says Rich Robinson.",
      "That happened with producer Jay Joyce, who has worked with artists like Cage the Elephant, Lainey Wilson and Eric Church. Joyce pushed them and was able to negotiate the sibling rivalry, what some call the U.S. equivalent to Oasis.",
      "\u201cOur story connects with people because if you have siblings, you understand the dynamic of that \u2014 how amazing it is and how difficult it can be,\u201d says Chris Robinson.",
      "His brother agrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve had our ups and downs, we've had our trials and tribulations, and we kind of came out stronger in the end. Chris and I\u2019s relationship is in the best place it\u2019s been probably in our lives.\u201d",
      "The brothers hint about that on the album's last song \u2014 \u201cKindred Friends\u201d \u2014 which strikes a loving, wistful note. \u201cKindred friend, where have you been?/Guess it's been a while/Through thick and thin/Many times again/Always makes me smile.\u201d",
      "The Robinsons say the song is partly about them but could be a toast to an old lover and is also reaching out to their fans after all these years.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sweetness to it,\u201d says Rich Robinson. \u201cI sent it to Chris and what he sang on it was really moving. It\u2019s a great way to end that record, you know?\u201d",

In \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d about a thief-turned-actor in Los Angeles, Christmas is more of a decorative ornament set ironically against all the deliciously unwholesome seediness. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Holiday\u201d (2006): Ok, so the cozy English cottage isn\u2019t real, but what is? The premise? The romances? Cameron Diaz\u2019s sprint through snowy fields and country roads in stilettos? Mr. Napkin Head? (Actually, maybe Mr. Napkin Head). The thing is it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Nancy Meyers\u2019 romantic fantasy is never trying to be anything other than a delightful movie, a little too earnest, a little too glossy and an unabashed ode to the classic movies Meyers loves right down to Eli Wallach teaching a new generation about the \u201cmeet cute.\u201d (Streaming on Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d: I\u2019ll take any excuse to rewatch Sydney Pollack\u2019s 1975 spy thriller with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway. But, like in \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d the Christmas backdrop isn\u2019t accidental. If the holidays are the ultimate time of togetherness, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d questions what that means in a post-Watergate world. (Streaming on Paramount+) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cKlaus\u201d: There\u2019s such a steady stream of mediocre or worse holiday movies that it can be easy to miss when a gem arrives. Sergio Pablos\u2019 2019 animated Netflix film was basically an origin story for Santa Claus by way of a desperate postman stationed in a remote northern village. Further proof, along with \u201cMiracle on 34th Street,\u201d that the best Christmas movies hinge on the postal service. (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cShaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas\u201d (2021): Clocking in at only 30 minutes, this is the perfect film for the littlest ones in the house. It\u2019s sweet, funny and adventurous and not even a little bit scary (unless you fear flying sleighs and botched recipes). (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d: Robert Benton\u2019s 1994 Richard Russo adaptation, with Paul Newman, spans Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s Eve. And while that covers Christmas, the richness of \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d exceeds its vaguely holiday setting. It\u2019s a movie more about daily smalltown struggles and long-term regrets, yet its warmth could match that any of any more traditional Christmas movie, and then some. That\u2019s much owed to Newman, but there are countless great performances here, including Jessica Tandy (in her final film), a never better Bruce Willis and a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sniveling police officer. It makes me happy just thinking about it. (Streaming on Kanopy, available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cCarol\u201d (2015): Even if Rooney Mara didn\u2019t catch Cate Blanchett\u2019s eye while wearing a Santa hat behind the counter of a Manhattan department store, Todd Haynes\u2019 \u201cCarol\u201d would still be one of the loveliest, most achingly tender Christmas movies around. Romance, heartbreak, plaids and martinis, \u201cCarol\u201d is truly flung out of space. (Streaming on Netflix, Paramount+ and MUBI) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d (1945): You don\u2019t have to watch it on TCM but it\u2019s certainly a fitting place to catch this 1945 screwball classic, with Barbara Stanwyck. She plays a popular homemaking column writer whose false persona as a family woman with a Connecticut farm is challenged when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) comes for Christmas dinner. As a rule, it\u2019s good to watch everything with Greenstreet. But the central conceit of \u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d \u2013 that the perfect Christmas is a lie, and isn\u2019t that fun \u2013 has proved remarkably durable. (Streaming on WatchTCM) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cLittle Women\u201d (1994 and 2019): Gillian Armstrong\u2019s \u201cLittle Women\u201d just feels like Christmas. Maybe part of that is because it came out around the holidays 30 years ago or that its DVD cover leans into it. But then you remember Beth\u2019s piano, the girls stomping through the snow with their Christmas feast, the caroling, the return of their father, the fireplaces and nightcaps and it makes sense. Those wanting all of this with a side of dancing Chalamet, Greta Gerwig\u2019s version is there for the taking too. (1994 version available for digital rental; 2019 streaming on Hulu) \u2014 Bahr",
      "\u201cThe Shop Around the Corner\u201d (1940): You can make a strong case for that other Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie. But in the knock-down, drag-out battle for the Christmas movie title, there\u2019s no greater delight than Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s timeless love story. One of the most charming movies ever made, partly because it doesn't shy away from real darkness, too. It also makes for a very effective drinking game if you sip something every time someone says \u201cMr. Matuschek.\u201d (Streaming on WatchTCM and Max) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d (1947): It\u2019s not even a remotely out of the box choice, but George Seaton\u2019s \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d endures as the platonic ideal of a Christmas movie. It\u2019s strikingly modern for something that came out 77 years ago with Maureen O\u2019Hara\u2019s single working mom, Natalie Wood\u2019s prematurely cynical New York kid and the litigious and capitalistic culture and yet it\u2019s all full of hope and holiday spirit (and a healthy amount of glossy capitalism), taking us from the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade through Christmas Day.

      "SEATAC, Washington -- Background music is no longer an afterthought at many airports, which are hiring local musicians and carefully curating playlists to help lighten travelers\u2019 moods.",
      "London\u2019s Heathrow Airport built a stage to showcase emerging British performers for the first time this summer. The program was so successful the airport hopes to bring it back in 2025. Nashville International Airport has five stages that host more than 800 performances per year, from country musicians to jazz combos. In the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana International Airport greets passengers with live merengue music.",
      "Tiffany Idiart and her two nieces were delighted to hear musicians during a recent layover at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.",
      "\u201cI like it. There\u2019s a lot of people here and they can all hear it,\u201d said Grace Idiart, 9. \u201cIf their flight got delayed or something like that, they could have had a hard day. And so the music could have made them feel better.\u201d",
      "Airports are also carefully curating their recorded playlists. Detroit Metro Airport plays Motown hits in a tunnel connecting its terminals. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has a playlist of local artists compiled by an area radio station. Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport commissioned a special piano accompaniment for its giant digital waterfall.",
      "Music isn\u2019t a new phenomenon in airport terminals. Brian Eno\u2019s \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d an album released in 1978, helped define the ambient music genre. It\u2019s minimalist and designed to calm.",
      "But Barry McPhillips, the head of international creative for Mood Media, which provides music for airports and other public spaces, said technology is enabling background music to be less generic and more tailored to specific places or times of day.",
      "Mood Media \u2013 formerly known as Muzak \u2013 develops playlists to appeal to business travelers or families depending on who\u2019s in the airport at any given time. It might program calmer music in the security line but something more energizing in the duty-free store.",
      "\u201cWe see it as a soundscape,\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cWe design for all of these moments.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a science to Mood Music\u2019s decisions on volume, tempo, even whether to play a song in a major key versus a minor one, he added.",
      "\u201cHow do we want to affect their mood at that moment?\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like, \u2018Here\u2019s a load of songs.\u2019 It\u2019s a load of songs for that 10-minute segment, and then we move to the next 10 minutes.\u201d",
      "At the same time, many airports are going low-tech, hiring local musicians to serenade travelers and give them a sense of the place they\u2019re passing through.",
      "Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and Midway airports have more than 100 live performances each year. Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor International Airport began a live music program five years ago and now has two stages featuring local artists.",
      "Tami Kuiken, the manager of airport music in Seattle, said the Seattle-Tacoma airport launched its live music program about a decade ago after a city commissioner heard live music at the airport in Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cThe idea was like, \u2019Man, why doesn\u2019t Seattle have music? We\u2019re a music city too,\u201d Kuiken said.",
      "At first, the airport created a playlist featuring emerging artists along with famous ones like Pearl Jam. Then it decided to try live musicians for a 12-week trial. It was so successful that the airport now features live musicians daily and is building new performance spaces.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s anxiety levels are very high when they\u2019re traveling,\u201d Kuiken said. \u201cThe feedback that we started getting was that once they got through the checkpoint and they were greeted with music, all of a sudden their anxiety and stress levels dropped.\u201d",
      "The programs also benefit musicians, who get paid to perform and gain wider exposure. When Colorado Springs Airport announced a live music program in March, more than 150 musicians applied. It now hosts two two-hour performances each week.",
      "David James, a singer and guitarist who plays at Seattle\u2019s airport about once a week, said waking up in time for a daytime gig took some adjustment. But he\u2019s gained new fans from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI get really sweet responses from people all the time, saying, \u2018That was so soothing to be able to just sit and listen to music in between flights,\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cSo it feels like it\u2019s especially therapeutic for people.\u201d",
      "Country stars like Blake Shelton and Keith Urban have come through Nashville's airport and interacted with local musicians, said Stacey Nickens, the airport's vice president of corporate communications and marketing. Shelton even gave one his guitar.",
      "Otto Stuparitz, a musicologist and lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has studied airport music, said airports should think carefully about their selections. Music that\u2019s meant to be actively listened to \u2013 like live music or catchy pop songs \u2013 can be very distracting in an already chaotic environment, he said. He has noticed some airports \u2013 especially in Europe -- turning off piped melodies altogether.",
      "But McPhillips said big spaces like airports can feel cold and unwelcoming without background music.",
      "\u201cA well-crafted audio strategy is one that people aren\u2019t particularly cognizant of,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just know they\u2019re having a good time and that it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d",

      "Now caretaker of his dad's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run",
      "NEW YORK -- Only recently given stewardship over his late father's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run.",
      "The only child of John Lennon and Yoko Ono won an Academy Award this year for a short film based on his parents' 1971 song \"Happy Christmas (War is Over\")\" and, a few months later, was nominated for his first-ever Grammy, for producing a box set on the album \u201cMind Games,\u201d originally released in 1973.",
      "\u201cIt feels overwhelming and surreal,\u201d said Lennon, who also recently shared a Webby Award with his mother for Ono's interactive art project \u201cWish Tree.\u201d",
      "For Lennon, who was 5 when the former Beatle was murdered in 1980, the work is a way to connect with his father. It's more than a preservation mission: On \u201cMind Games,\u201d he takes artistic license, pulling apart the recordings of John Lennon's music to create something entirely new.",
      "Lennon was inspired, in part, by another Beatle offspring, Dhani Harrison, who helped repackage his own father's \u201cAll Things Must Pass.\u201d Dhani Harrison is also behind this fall's reissue of his dad's \u201cLiving in the Material World,\u201d but that experience is nothing like what Lennon did with \u201cMind Games.\u201d",
      "Besides the music, the innovative box is modeled after one of his mother's art pieces and filled with art reproductions, hidden music, video, messages and puzzles, some only visible through an ultraviolet light that is included \u2014 \u201cmind games,\u201d remember? The deluxe box retails for $1,350, but there are less expensive options.",
      "Lennon, 49, knew his father was a musician before he died; the boy tagged along to the studio for some \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d sessions. But truly understanding his impact came later, like when he'd hear fans singing his father's music outside their New York apartment on the Oct. 9 birthday they shared. \u201cIt was pretty clear to me that wasn't happening with my friends,\u201d he said.",
      "His father's music played constantly around the house, and learning to play those songs launched his own journey to become a musician.",
      "\u201cI think I would have rebelled more against my dad's \u2014 and my mom's \u2014 music if I had grown up with my dad in the house and I had been angry at him or rebelled against him,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause he wasn't around, I've always really cherished the music as sort of a living part of him.\u201d",
      "He inherited the job of keeping his father's music alive for new generations when his mom, now 91, retired.",
      "In liner notes for \u201cMind Games,\u201d Lennon explains that \u201cthe only meaningful way that I can show my love to him\u201d is to work hard on his music and keep it in the culture's consciousness. That's poignant, and maybe a little sad. Does Lennon really have to prove to anyone that he loves his father?",
      "\u201cWhat else can I do in this Earth to express my love and reverence for my father than to do an incredibly meticulous job of taking care of his music?\u201d he said. \u201cI can't actually think of anything else, other than taking care of my mother, which I try to do as well.\u201d",
      "That reverence for his elders came from his mother, he believes. When his Japanese grandparents came over to the U.S. \u201cit was like the president was visiting,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Only after he began the \u201cMind Games\u201d project did Lennon learn that the album wasn't particularly well-regarded when it was released. He found an interview where even John Lennon considered it a transition from a period of political activism to being a musician again. The title song was its only hit.",
      "That attitude lingers, judging by an online site called \u201cBrutally Honest Rock Album Reviews.\u201d In an unsigned review, the author said the \u201cMind Games\u201d reissue defines overkill. \u201cYou can now own and forever cherish six different versions of songs that were unmemorable at best and a complete waste of time at worst.\u201d",
      "That only motivated Lennon to work harder, and led to a bold artistic decision. Part of the reason the album didn't really connect was because it wasn't promoted well or supported by concerts, he said. But he also described the original album mix as thin and not doing justice to the music.",
      "Using the original recordings, he constructed new versions of the songs, sometimes emphasizing different instruments. He sought a warmer, more direct sound reminiscent of Lennon's \u201cPlastic Ono Band\u201d album \u2014 most visibly on \u201cAisumasen (I'm Sorry),\u201d one of a handful of compositions reflecting marital turmoil that presaged Lennon's notorious \u201clost weekend\u201d separation from Ono.",
      "Different versions of the title cut also show Sean's approach. There's the original \u201cMind Games,\u201d with a distinctive chiming sound that drives the melody. That's stripped away in a new mix where a reggae guitar lick becomes audible. An organ-dominated instrumental sounds like a church hymn. There are other outtakes, some with alternate lyrics and one with a snippet of \u201cMake Love, Not War,\u201d a song fragment dating back to the Beatles that the author repurposed.",
      "He didn't have a trove of unheard material to mine, other than Lennon's demo of \u201cI'm the Greatest,\u201d a song he gave to Beatle mate Ringo Starr.",
      "In some of the new versions, Sean goes beyond remixing or revealing outtakes to imposing his own artistic vision over his father's.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who feel that it's taking liberties, and I guess it technically is,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThe way I look at it is, if I'm going to do the best job I can, the only way I can do that is to follow my heart and make it sound the best that it can sound. If that means maybe turning down an instrument a lot in a certain section because I don't think it's helping, then I'm going to do that.\u201d",
      "For anyone who wants the original versions, they're readily available.",
      "\u201cIt's very forensic work,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not worried about what someone else is going to think. I'm just in there trying to do good by my dad, and I really feel that I know how to do good by him, because I know his music better than I know anybody else's music.\u201d",
      "As a musician, he relates to moments where his father expresses vulnerability, like an interview where John described \u201cIntuition\u201d as a good song where he didn't nail the lyrics. The \u201cGet Back\u201d film of recording sessions for the \u201cLet it Be\u201d album showed the Beatles as humans who didn't hand songs down from Mount Olympus.",
      "Next on the docket is a film resurrection of the \u201cOne to One\u201d concerts involving his father and a reissue of the \u201cWalls and Bridges\u201d album. Sean, who lives and works in New York and is involved in a longtime relationship with musician and model Kemp Muhl, released his own album, \u201cAsterisms,\u201d this year.",
      "Told he sounded like his father when singing forcefully, Lennon practically whispered lyrics on his early albums. He hated the way he sounded, but didn't want to deal with the comparisons. He doesn't hold back anymore. \u201cNow I'm too old to care,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI didn't get into music because I had some great talent or something,\u201d he said. \u201cI got into it because my dad was this famous musician and playing his songs and learning his music made me feel closer to him.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jay-Z\u2019s lawyers asked a judge Wednesday to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs when she was 13.",
      "The unidentified woman recently added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to her lawsuit against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs\u2019 limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "In their court filing Wednesday, Jay-Z's lawyers cited a recent television interview in which the woman acknowledged inconsistencies in her story.",
      "The filing came before Combs appeared for a pretrial hearing in his criminal case. After lawyers discussed evidentiary deadlines, prosecutors told Judge Arun Subramanian that any new charges against the hip-hop mogul before a May trial would require minimal new evidence to be shared among lawyers.",
      "In the criminal case, Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that the Bad Boy Records founder coerced and abused women for years with help from associates and employees. Combs, who has been jailed without bail for three months, hugged his lawyers and touched his heart as he acknowledged his children among spectators.",
      "In the civil case, one of several filed against him, the woman originally asserted that she was raped by Combs at the after-party but did not mention Jay-Z.",
      "Last Friday, NBC aired an interview in which she said she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault. NBC also reported that a representative of the Maddens said they were touring the Midwest during the VMAs, and her father said he does not recall what would have been a drive home of more than five hours.",
      "Jay-Z has said the article proves that Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame. Attorney Teny R. Geragos, representing Combs, has said the TV interview was a part of the \u201cbeginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "In the newly filed court papers, Jay-Z's lawyers wrote that the allegations \u201chave caused incalculable harm to Mr. Carter, his family, his businesses, his employees, and his legacy.\u201d",
      "Buzzbee told The Associated Press via email that the plaintiffs' lawyers planned to respond in court to the latest filing.",
      "\u201cThey continue to file meritless motions that are contrary to the rules and which have absolutely no merit,\u201d Buzzbee said.",
      "Buzbee announced in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs gained fame in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d"

      "A popular social media influencer has issued an apology after a Swedish tabloid published a report saying she created a \u201cwork environment filled with fear and psychological pressure\u201d at her fashion brand, Djerf Avenue.",
      "In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was \u201cgenuinely sorry\u201d to anyone she has \u201churt or let down\u201d after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a \u201cculture of favoritism and control.\u201d",
      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",
      "The report also cited someone that said Djerf had installed her own toilet at the company that could only be used by her and \u201cher favorites.\u201d One employee had to scrub the toilet because it was used by the wrong person, it said.",
      "\u201cWhen I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\u201d Djerf wrote in her post on Instagram, where she has 3 million followers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture. She said the company has hired a \u201cmore experienced\u201d management team and were teaming up with an external organizational psychologist who could talk to employees.",
      "Djerf Avenue is also now doing monthly anonymous surveys to collect feedback from workers, the post said.",
      "Last year, Djerf was featured on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list along with her boyfriend Rasmus Johansson, who co-founded the clothing label with her in 2019.",
      "Known for her \u201cclean girl\u201d aesthetic looks and bouncy hair, Djerf recently had a prominent campaign with model Hailey Bieber\u2019s skincare and beauty line, Rhode."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jacob Elordi is suddenly everywhere in Hollywood \u2014 so much so that he thinks he must be dreaming.",
      "Amid a remarkable streak of high-profile projects with respected filmmakers \u2014 Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla,\u201d Guillermo del Toro's upcoming adaptation of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and, in theaters now, Paul Schrader's \u201cOh, Canada\u201d \u2014 the 27-year-old isn\u2019t taking his success for granted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be so arrogant as to say like, you know, \u2018I choose what is befitting of me,\u2019\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful because to say you choose these things sort of seems too conscious or something. I kind of am in a constant state of like, \u2018Wake me up from this.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, Canada\u201d tells the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), an acclaimed documentarian on his deathbed who, in what becomes a final act of confession, agrees to have the cameras turned toward him for a documentary about his own life.",
      "Elordi plays a young Fife in the film, based on Russell Banks\u2019 2021 novel, \u201cForegone.\u201d Despite their physical differences, Elordi\u2019s performance as a younger Gere is believable, thanks in part to the amount of effort he put into studying Gere\u2019s mannerisms.",
      "\u201cRichard has such a rich career of films and a really diverse range of films so there was a lot to watch and just kind of copy him, you know? Like Simon Says or something,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cThe best one for physicality was \u2018American Gigolo,\u2019 because I think he was 29 or something when he made that film. So, it\u2019s, you know, not far from where I am now.\u201d",
      "Schrader is not known for making big-budget blockbusters. And while the filmmaker has reaped critical praise throughout his prolific career, he\u2019s made his share of panned flops.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the 78-year-old from cementing his reputation as a pioneering auteur with an impressive catalog of actors who admire and work with him, including Amanda Seyfried,Willem Dafoe,Oscar Isaac and Nicolas Cage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a list of people who have sort of given to the art form of cinema and he\u2019s right up at the top of it,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cAs soon as the email comes through and it says Paul Schrader, you go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite that kind of reputation, Schrader is not one to break box office records. As he has looked back on his career, he\u2019s been frank about not prioritizing the immediate financial success of the dozens of films he\u2019s made.",
      "\u201cTo me, shelf life is more valuable than the box office,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that much from opening weekend.\u201d",
      "Instead, he evaluates a different set of criteria when determining how he feels about a film in his archive: \u201cIf I get it made, that\u2019s the first level of success. If it\u2019s taken seriously, that\u2019s the second level of success. And if it actually works with audiences, that\u2019s the third.\u201d",
      "While his films aren\u2019t necessarily avant-garde or experimental, Schrader makes the kinds of movies talked about more among film buffs than mass audiences. His 2017 \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d for example, will not satiate those who crave closure or clear-cut endings. And \u201cOh, Canada\u201d is not exactly action-packed.",
      "But Elordi rejects the notion that Schrader\u2019s movies aren\u2019t accessible to a wide audience.",
      "\u201cThat kind of gives you like this elitist feel, you know? I hate that cinema conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a language in cinema that doesn\u2019t really take a long time to learn if you are sort of watching healthy things.\u201d",
      "Still, Elordi acknowledged certain movies require patience and a willingness to sit with ambiguity.",
      "\u201cMy mom says stuff like that to me all the time. She\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, but the movie can\u2019t just end. Like, I need to know about this, this and this.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, the movie can just end, and you can go away and think about it,\u2019\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Don\u2019t go looking in Wikipedia for architect L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th",
      "\u201cThe making of a good building,\u201d observed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, \u201cis a great moral performance.\u201d",
      "Like many notable quotes about architecture, it speaks to grandeur, permanence, scale. One imagines L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, the visionary Hungarian architect who escaped the Holocaust and sailed to the United States to find his American Dream, would heartily agree.",
      "But don\u2019t go looking on Wikipedia. T\u00f3th, played with deep soul and unrelenting intensity by Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d is actually fictional, though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, so richly realized is his story in director Brady Corbet\u2019s audacious new film. Though not for everyone, it's a film that can justifiably be described as \u201cepic\u201d in ambition and design. And, wouldn't you know, ambition and design are precisely what the movie\u2019s about.",
      "Of course, that\u2019s not all. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which takes its name from the raw style of architecture that T\u00f3th creates, is also about the incalculable trauma that followed World War II. It\u2019s about the immigrant experience, and it\u2019s about what happens when the American Dream beckons, then fails. It also explores a different dream: the artist\u2019s dream, and what happens when it meets opposing forces, be they geographic displacement or cold economic calculus.",
      "Not to mix our arts metaphors, but it\u2019s fair to say a story like this needs a pretty big canvas. Corbet, working with co-writer Mona Fastvold, definitely gives himself that, shooting in VistaVision, with its expansive field of view; dividing his film into movements like a symphony; and finally, allowing himself a whopping three hours and 35 minutes, including a built-in intermission. The parallels with architecture here seem clear. Make a building, or make a movie \u2014 but if you\u2019re thinking small, go home.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d spans 30 years in the life of T\u00f3th, whom we first meet in a terrific sequence, darting through darkness. It soon emerges these are the chaotic alleys of an immigrant ship. He\u2019s been left with nothing, but still lucky: unlike more than half of fellow Hungarian Jews, he's survived the Holocaust. His first view of the United States is the Statue of Liberty towering above the deck \u2014 filmed upside down, a choice we\u2019ll understand better later.",
      "T\u00f3th heads to Philadelphia, where he\u2019s greeted by cousin Attila (Alessandro Nivola), who'll let him work at his furniture store. Attila also bears monumental news: L\u00e1zl\u00f3's beloved wife, Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones) has survived her own ordeal in the camps, and is alive in Europe. (Just watching Brody receive this news is a vision hard to shake \u2014 the actor, himself the son of a Hungarian refugee, is doing his best work here since his Oscar-winning performance in \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d)",
      "A fortunate break comes when Harry Lee Van Buren (Joe Alwyn), the haughty, aristocratic son of industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, comes looking for help renovating a library for his father. The perfectionist T\u00f3th begins creating a modernist gem, with daylight shining from above onto a single elegant reading chair and lamp (at moments, this movie's a great advertisement for architecture school).",
      "But then Dad himself \u2014 an impeccably clad, impossibly dapper yet explosive and ultimately monstrous character played to the hilt by Guy Pearce \u2014 shows up too early, infuriated that his library's been torn up. He expels the cousins and they don\u2019t get paid. T\u00f3th ends up in a church shelter, shoveling coal by day.",
      "But the elder Van Buren comes to see his error, especially when the press picks up on his library. Soon, T\u00f3th is dining with the wealthy at Van Buren\u2019s palatial Doylestown estate, and learning that Van Buren has tapped him to build a vast community center atop a hill to honor his mother.",
      "The film\u2019s second part opens with Erzs\u00e9bet arriving in America, along with T\u00f3th's niece Zs\u00f3fia (Raffey Cassidy). Erzs\u00e9bet, given a sensitive, intelligent portrayal by Jones, is suffering deeply from the physical effects of the war. She also quickly sees the darker side of the Van Burens. But T\u00f3th is stuck, mired in a project that will take years, a living hostage to the Van Burens on their estate, fighting for every phase of the project and darned near going mad \u2014 on top of a drug addiction stemming from the war \u2014 as Van Buren demands cuts and compromises, including the height of his building.",
      "A beautiful \u2013 and horrible \u2014 sequence comes in the exquisite marble quarries of Carrara, in Italy, where T\u00f3th travels with Van Buren to choose a final piece. The beauty is in the filmmaking. The horror is in what transpires between the men \u2014 and it's arguably an uncomfortably jarring note, given how suddenly it seems to arrive out of the blue.",
      "A coda, decades later in Venice, reveals something profound about why T\u00f3th was so insistent about the measurements of his Doylestown creation. And so, yes, it takes more than three hours for us to learn the full truth about T\u00f3th's vision.",
      "Not all directors can pull off such a feat and make it worth our while. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d like its protagonist, is not without flaws or incongruities or indulgences. But it hardly seems accidental that one of the film\u2019s key lines tells us it\u2019s the destination, not the journey, that matters. Corbet went big here \u2014 really big \u2014 and it paid off.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an A24 release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 215 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Each volume features collaborations with artists across the globe. But this time, the 30-year-old also harnessed voices of the audience at his shows to create harmonies for the album. Collier often acts as a conductor at his concerts, directing different sections of the crowd to sing segments of his songs, placing microphones around the venue to record their contributions.",
      "One track on \u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d is titled \u201c100,000 Voices,\" and it quite literally features that many singers.",
      "\u201cThere's like over 100,000 people on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cOver 100 of those are established artists or members of groups like orchestras and choirs and things that I really love and respect, from every single continent of the world. But yeah, most of 100,000 voices are the audience members from tour.\u201d",
      "His inventive approach to composition has scored him three Grammy nominations for the 2025 award show, including album of the year, global music performance and best arrangement, instrumental or a cappella.",
      "He's also the first British artist to win a Grammy for each of his first four albums. Not bad for an artist that began his career posting on YouTube, later to become mentored by the late-great producer Quincy Jones and release a number of critically acclaimed records.",
      "Still, Collier can't believe he's once again up for album of the year, the show's top prize. (\u201cDjesse Vol. 3\u201d was nominated in 2021 but lost to Taylor Swift's \u201cfolklore.\u201d) In 2025, the other nominees include Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Billie Eilish.",
      "\u201cIt's thrilling and wild,\u201d he says of the honor.",
      "\u201cThe album is in some ways like a celebration of the human voice,\u201d he says of \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost more proud of what that means philosophically than I am for, like, these specific songs on the record be recognized (for awards). But it\u2019s a really thrilling predicament.\u201d",
      "Collier believes that everyone can sing and considers himself to be \u201ca leader of a choir,\u201d in his audience improvisations and onstage collaborators. \u201cI really try to make space for all these different kinds of people to just feel welcome,\" he says. \"And if they can feel welcome, then they\u2019re a part of the music.\u201d",
      "\u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d contains collaborations with artists across genres, including Brandi Carlile, Camilo, aespa, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, John Legend, Tori Kelly and Coldplay's Chris Martin.",
      "But now that Collier has completed the \u201cDjesse\u201d series, what's next?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a clear idea of exactly what\u2019s coming next, which I love, actually. Sometimes in life you need those moments of question marks,\" he says.",

Soon, Martha\u2019s cancer worsens and she asks Ingrid to assist her in self-euthanasia. \u201cThe cancer can\u2019t get me if I get the cancer first,\u201d she says.",
      "Why not ask someone she\u2019s closer with? Well, she has, Martha says, but for various reasons none of them are willing. With an illegal pill bought from, as she says, \u201cthe dark web\u201d and a slight conspiratorial vibe that they\u2019re committing a crime together, they travel to a modernist house in upstate New York where Martha plans to end her life. She'll be comforted, she believes, having Ingrid just down the hall. Martha doesn't want any fuss, just a nice time. \u201cAs if we were on vacation,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the title of which plays off Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d is about finding dignity and contentment with death as a natural part of life, and, perhaps, the mystery of the relationships that end up mattering the most. The one thing Martha and Ingrid share is a former lover (played by John Turturro ), who turns up again in clandestine meetings with Ingrid. He\u2019s preoccupied with environmental disaster and the death of the planet, but fondly recalls sleeping with Martha as \u201clike having sex with a terrorist \u2013 it always felt like the last time.\u201d",
      "No one besides Almod\u00f3var can get away with lines like this, in any language. A less fevered austerity has crept into some of his fine late-period movies (particularly \u201cPain and Glory\u201d but also \u201cParallel Mothers\u201d ), but within them still beats a passionate, melodramatic heart. Death is everywhere in \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\" The movie is very much in dialogue with other works like James Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead.\" (They watch John Huston's 1987 adaptation one night.) But it\u2019s not an especially dour film, and you sense, in it\u2019s boldly colorful designs and lush storytelling that Almod\u00f3var is as concerned with life as he is with death.",
      "\u201cI still think sex is the best way to fend off looming thoughts of death,\u201d Martha tells Ingrid.",
      "Not all of this works, even if every bit of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d feels conjured \u2014 as is typical of Almod\u00f3var's thickly layered films \u2014 from a fully fleshed-out emotional terrain. (Here, he adapts Sigrid Nunez\u2019s 2020 American novel, \u201cWhat Are You Going Through.\") There's an awkward and overdone flashback early in the film when Martha recalls her painful history with the father to her estranged daughter. Some of the dialogue can sound stilted.",
      "But what absolutely, undoubtedly does work is Moore and Swinton together. If some of the more melodramatic or crime-movie flourishes feel forced, the central relationship of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d is consistently provocative. Swinton, in particular, is extraordinarily deft at finding Martha's singular equilibrium: on the brink of death but still alive to so much \u2014 books, movies, the conversation of a friend. Death is coming, so best to spend what's left in good company.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\" a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for thematic content, strong language and some sexual reference. Running time: 110 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "No one was expecting it",
      "NEW YORK -- No one was expecting it. Late last year, Andr\u00e9 3000 released his debut solo album, \u201cNew Blue Sun,\u201d 18 years after his legendary rap group Outkast's last studio album, \u201cIdlewild.\u201d",
      "But \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has \u201cno bars,\u201d he jokes. It's a divergence from rap because \u201cthere was nothing I was liking enough to rap about, or I didn't feel it sounded fresh. I'm not about to serve you un-fresh (expletive.)\u201d",
      "Instead, he offered up a six-track instrumental album of ambient alt-jazz \u2014 with special attention paid to the flute.",
      "\u201cThe sound, that's how I got into it,\u201d he says of the instrument. \u201cThe portability, too. You can't tote around a piano and play in Starbucks.\"",
      "He's also invested in the flute's history \u2014 like learning about Mayan flutes made from clay, a design he had re-created in cedarwood. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of fables and, you know, indigenous stories that go along with playing the flute \u2014 playing like the birds or playing your heart like the wind \u2014 it kind of met (me) where I was in life,\" he says.",
      "\u201cFlutes \u2014 wind instruments in general \u2014 are the closest thing you get to actually hearing a human,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou're actually hearing the breath of a person.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a stunning collection, one that has earned Andr\u00e9 3000 three new Grammy Award nominations: album of the year, alternative jazz, and instrumental composition. Those arrive exactly 25 years after the 1999 Grammys, where Outkast received their first nomination \u2014 for \u201cRosa Parks,\u201d from their third album, \u201cAquemini\" \u2014 and 20 years after the group won album of the year for \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt matters because we all want to be acknowledged or recognized,\u201d Andr\u00e9 3000 says of his new Grammy nominations. \u201cIt's a type of proof of connection, in some type of way ... especially with the Grammys, because it's voted on by a committee of musicians and people in the industry.\u201d",
      "He's a bit surprised by the attention, too, given the type of album he created. \u201cWe have no singles on the radio, not even singles that are hot in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're sitting next to Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, these are highly, hugely popular music artists, I'm satisfied just because of that ... we won just to be a part of the whole conversation.\"",
      "He theorizes that it may be because popular music listening habits are broadening. \u201cA lot of artists are just trying different things. Even, you know, the album that Beyonc\u00e9 is nominated for, it\u2019s not her normal thing,\u201d he says of her country-and-then-some record, \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in this place where things are kind of shifting and moving.\"",
      "For Andr\u00e9 3000, \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has allowed him to \u201cfeel like a whole new artist,\u201d but it is also an extension of who he's always been. \u201cBeing on the road with Outkast and picking up a bass clarinet at a pawn shop in New York and just sitting on the back of the bus playing with it \u2014 these things have been around,\u201d he says.",
      "He's also always embraced \u201cnewness,\u201d as he puts it, experimenting creatively \u201ceven if it sounds non-masterful.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven producing for Outkast, I was just learning these instruments. If I ... put my hands down and play \u2018Ms. Jackson,\u2019 I'm not knowing what I'm playing. But I like it,\u201d he says.",
      "As for a new Outkast album, \u201cI never say never,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can say that the older I get, I feel like that time has happened.\u201d",

Eight years later, she received international acclaim for \u201cThe Inheritance of Loss,\u201d released in the U.S. by Atlantic Monthly Press. Winner of the Booker and the National Book Critics Circle award, her novel follows the lives of an undocumented Indian immigrant in the U.S. and of an Anglicized Indian overseas in the state of West Bengal. Desai was 35 when she received the Booker, the youngest woman at the time to win the prize.",

      "The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.",

      "The proceedings are civil, which carries a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, so Goldspring only had to decide on the balance of probabilities whether the Tates had evaded tax.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\u201d the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "The petition says prison call logs from Lanez at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that he is coordinating attacks on Megan's credibility.",
      "An email seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.",
      "The petition says the protective order issued to prevent the previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "The petition says that one blogger in particular, Elizabeth Milagro Cooper, whom Megan is suing in a separate lawsuit, is acting as Lanez \u201cpuppet and mouthpiece.\u201d She alleges Cooper is spreading falsehoods on social media and YouTube, saying in one video posted to X, \u201cCan you even prove she was shot?\" and calling her a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d in another post.",
      "Cooper's attorney Michael Pancier declined comment on the California petition, and said in an email that their forthcoming response to the separate federal lawsuit against her will speak for itself.",
      "A previous motion to dismiss Megan's lawsuit said it makes \u201cdubious legal claims\u201d and \u201cirrelevant and impertinent allegations.\u201d",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion, now 29, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music\u2019s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with \u201cSavage,\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, and as a guest on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cWAP.\u201d",
      "Lanez, 32, began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts."

      "Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon\u2019s Multnomah County, home to Portland",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, according to an annual county report released Friday that officials described as showing the peak of the fentanyl crisis in the area.",
      "The report found that 456 homeless people died in the county in 2023 \u2014 the highest number on record and a 45% jump compared to 2022. Last year's deaths included 282 from unintentional drug overdose \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 with fentanyl contributing to 89% of those fatalities.",
      "The increase in fentanyl-related deaths among homeless people mirrors national trends, the county said in a news release, and reflects the spread of the substance in recent years from the East Coast across the Western U.S. In 2017, fentanyl was recorded as contributing to the death of one homeless person in the county; by 2023, that number had reached 251.",
      "\u201cThe devastating toll fentanyl is taking on our community is starkly apparent in this report and it is heartbreaking,\u201d Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in the news release. \u201cThis is a moment for our community to grieve alongside more than 450 families who lost loved ones in 2023 and to continue providing and fighting for more behavioral health, supportive housing and other resources to respond.\u201d",
      "Methamphetamine also contributed to 81% of 2023 homeless overdose deaths.",
      "Multnomah County Health Officer Richard Bruno said the report \u201chits close to the heart,\u201d as many of the people who died were patients that he cared for in clinic. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future, following a local and state emergency declaration to address the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cAs we are seeing fentanyl overdose deaths decreasing in 2024, we are hopeful that future reports will hold much lower numbers,\u201d he said in the news release.",
      "Fourteen deaths were due to homicide, and 26 deaths were attributed to suicide. Twenty-two deaths were transportation-related, with the report noting that homeless people last year were 58 times more likely to die from a transportation-related injury compared to the county's general population.",
      "There were no deaths due to heat and one due to cold exposure, according to the report.",
      "The average age at death was 46 years, roughly 30 years younger than the national life expectancy at birth."

      "The U.S. flu season is underway",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. flu season is underway, with cases surging across much of the country, health officials said Friday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted sharp increases in several measures, including lab tests and emergency room visits.",
      "\u201cIt's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,\u201d said the CDC's Alicia Budd.",
      "Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.",
      "\u201cFlu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,\u201d Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms.",
      "Louisiana is another early hot spot.",
      "\u201cJust this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,\" said Dr. Catherine O\u2019Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. \"You hear parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t come to work because of the flu\u2019 and \u2018Where can I get a flu test?\u2019\u201d",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is low nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data.",
      "RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show.",
      "The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, include lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu.",
      "No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said.",
      "Last winter's flu season was considered \u201cmoderate\u201d overall, but it was long \u2014 21 weeks \u2014 and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season.",
      "The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations \u2014 and for whom their vaccination status was known \u2014 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that\u2019s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data.",
      "Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date.",
      "Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely.",
      "\u201cAll those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cIt's not too late to get vaccinated.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Specialty pharmacies and online companies that have been selling off-brand copies of two blockbuster drugs for obesity and diabetes will need to phase out their versions next year under a federal decision issued Thursday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said that a nationwide shortage of Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro has been resolved, eliminating the need for copycat versions of the drugs that have become wildly popular with Americans trying to lose weight.",
      "The decision is a win for Lilly \u2014 which had been pressing the FDA to take the step for months \u2014 and is expected to impact how patients access the drugs, including how much they pay.",
      "Zepbound is FDA-approved to treat obesity and Mounjaro is approved for diabetes. They use the same active ingredient, tirzepatide.",
      "The FDA said Thursday that \u201cLilly\u2019s supply is currently meeting or exceeding demand,\u201d after two years of shortages.",
      "Both drugs are part of the GLP-1 class that has shown unprecedented results for helping people shed weight by decreasing appetite and boosting feelings of fullness. Wegovy and Ozempic \u2014 competing drugs from Novo Nordisk \u2014 remain on the FDA\u2019s shortage list.",
      "With demand for GLP-1 drugs booming, compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies like Hims and Ro have jumped into the market, selling cheaper versions online. People can usually get a month's supply for several hundred dollars.",
      "Thursday\u2019s decision gives businesses between 60 and 90 days, depending on their size, to phase out their products.",
      "The FDA permits compounded versions of brand name drugs when they are in shortage, and the shift back to Lilly\u2019s medications could improve safety for consumers. The FDA warned patients last year about problems with the ingredients and formulations of some GLP-1 drugs sold online. The agency has limited oversight of compounding pharmacies, which are primarily overseen by state authorities.",
      "Compounding pharmacies use raw drug ingredients to produce customized versions of prescription medications \u2014 for instance, when patients have allergies to certain ingredients. The industry has grown into a multibillion-dollar business over the past decade amid increasing drug shortages.",
      "Demand for off-brand GLP-1 drugs has been amplified by aggressive online promotions from telehealth companies, which aren\u2019t subject to the same marketing rules as drugmakers.",
      "The FDA previously declared an end to the shortage of Mounjaro and Zepbound in early October, but reversed its decision after public pushback and a lawsuit filed by compounding pharmacies.",

      "Packaged foods in the U.S. will have to follow new rules in order to call themselves \u201chealthy,\u201d according to changes finalized Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "It\u2019s an update of the agency\u2019s definition originally devised 30 years ago. The move is aimed at helping Americans navigate food labels at the grocery store and make choices that are aligned with federal dietary guidelines \u2014 in hopes of reducing rates of diet-related chronic disease, the FDA said.",
      "Under the rule, products that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201d must contain a certain amount of food from one or more food groups such as fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein. And for the first time, the rule sets certain limits for added sugars. Foods must also limit sodium and saturated fat at levels that depend on the type of product, the FDA said.",
      "The change banishes foods such as sugary cereals, highly sweetened yogurts, white bread and some granola bars from bearing a \u201chealthy\u201d label, while allowing foods such as avocados, olive oil, salmon, eggs and some trail mix to use it. Even water can now be labeled as healthy, the agency said.",
      "\u201cIt's critical for the future of the country that food be a vehicle for wellness,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement. \u201cImproving access to nutrition information is an important public health effort the FDA can undertake to help people build healthy eating patterns.\u201d",
      "The new rule will take effect within two months and food manufacturers will have until February 2028 to comply. A label that designates certain foods as healthy is still being developed, FDA officials said. Under the previous rule, about 15% of products were eligible for the healthy designation, but only 5% made the claim.",
      "First proposed in 2022, the change is a much-needed update to \u201chorribly outdated\u201d guidance, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.",
      "\u201cBig picture, this is a huge improvement from a 30-year-old outdated definition based on 40-year-old science,\u201d he said.",
      "The new rule acknowledges that dietary and nutrition knowledge has progressed over three decades and that the previous definition didn\u2019t jibe with dietary guidelines that are the cornerstone of federal programs and policies.",
      "Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group, said that the new rule \u201cstands to exclude some packaged foods, despite countless years of industry innovation to provider healthier options.\u201d",
      "Sarah Gallo, an official for the group, said it is concerned the new rule \u201cis not based on clear and unambiguous scientific evidence\u201d and doesn't fully consider the full potential economic impact on consumers.",
      "The updated criteria are based on data that could improve public health, including diet-related chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes, the FDA said.",
      "More than three-quarters of Americans have diets low in vegetables, fruit and dairy, according to the FDA. Nearly 80% exceed limits on saturated fat, more than 60% exceed limits on added sugars and about 90% exceed limits on sodium that can reduce chronic disease.",

      "California officials have declared a state of emergency over the spread of bird flu, which is tearing through dairy cows in that state and causing sporadic illnesses in people in the U.S.",
      "That raises new questions about the virus, which has spread for years in wild birds, commercial poultry and many mammal species.",
      "The virus, also known as Type A H5N1, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cattle in March. Since then, bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in 16 states.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation's first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said this week.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom said he declared the state of emergency to better position state staff and supplies to respond to the outbreak.",
      "California has been looking for bird flu in large milk tanks during processing. And they have found the virus it at least 650 herds, representing about three-quarters of all affected U.S. dairy herds.",
      "The virus was recently detected in Southern California dairy farms after being found in the state\u2019s Central Valley since August.",
      "\u201cThis proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed again this week that the virus poses low risk to the general public.",
      "Importantly, there are no reports of person-to-person transmission and no signs that the virus has changed to spread more easily among humans.",
      "In general, flu experts agreed with that assessment, saying it\u2019s too soon to tell what trajectory the outbreak could take.",
      "\u201cThe entirely unsatisfactory answer is going to be: I don\u2019t think we know yet,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "But virus experts are wary because flu viruses are constantly mutating and small genetic changes could change the outlook.",
      "This week, health officials confirmed the first known case of severe illness in the U.S. All previous the previous U.S. cases \u2014 there have been about 60 \u2014 were generally mild.",
      "The patient in Louisiana, who is older than 65 and had underlying medical problems, is in critical condition. Few details have been released, but officials said the person developed severe respiratory symptoms after exposure to a backyard flock of sick birds.",
      "That makes it the first confirmed U.S. infection tied to backyard birds, the CDC said.",
      "Tests showed that the strain that caused the person's illness is one found in wild birds, but not in cattle. Last month, health officials in Canada reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu, also with the virus strain found in wild birds.",
      "Previous infections in the U.S. have been almost all in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected dairy cattle or poultry. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "It's possible that as more people become infected, more severe illnesses will occur, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "Worldwide, nearly 1,000 cases of illnesses caused by H5N1 have been reported since 2003, and more than half of people infected have died, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cI assume that every H5N1 virus has the potential to be very severe and deadly,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "People who have contact with dairy cows or commercial poultry or with backyard birds are at higher risk and should use precautions including respiratory and eye protection and gloves, CDC and other experts said.",
      "\u201cIf birds are beginning to appear ill or die, they should very careful about how they handle those animals,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a public health disease expert at the University of Minnesota.",
      "The CDC has paid for flu shots to protect farmworkers against seasonal flu \u2014 and against the risk that the workers could become infected with two flu types at the same time, potentially allowing the bird flu virus to mutate and become more dangerous. The government also said that farmworkers who come in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered antiviral drugs even if they show no symptoms.",
      "In addition to direct contact with farm animals and wild birds, the H5N1 virus can be spread in raw milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink, because the heat treatment kills the virus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "But high levels of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk. And raw milk sold in stores in California was recalled in recent weeks after the virus was detected at farms and in the products.",
      "In Los Angeles, county officials reported that two indoor cats that were fed the recalled raw milk died from bird flu infections. Officials were investigating additional reports of sick cats.",
      "Health officials urge people to avoid drinking raw milk, which can spread a host of germs in addition to bird flu.",
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department has stepped up testing of raw milk across the country to help detect and contain the outbreak. A federal order issued this month requires testing, which began this week in 13 states.",

      "The complaint also says CVS sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for such prescriptions in violation of the False Claims Act. CVS is the largest pharmacy chain in the U.S., where there are more than 9,000 pharmacies.",
      "A representative of CVS said the company has cooperated with the DOJ\u2019s investigation for more than four years, and strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d within the complaint.",
      "Among the unlawful prescriptions that CVS allegedly filled from Oct. 17, 2013, to the present were for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, early fills of opioids, and \u201ctrinity\u201d prescriptions \u2014 a dangerous combination of drugs made up of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant, according to prosecutors.",
      "CVS also allegedly filled large quantities of prescriptions for controlled substances written by prescribers it knew to be engaged in \u201cpill mill practices\u201d \u2014 that is, prescribers who issue large numbers of controlled substance prescriptions without any medical purpose, investigators said.",
      "According to the complaint, CVS ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources, including its own pharmacists and internal data, indicating that its stores were dispensing such prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit alleges that CVS failed to exercise its critical role as gatekeeper of dangerous prescription opioids and, instead, facilitated the illegal proliferation of these highly addictive drugs, including by pill mill prescribers,\" U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha for the District of Rhode Island said in a press release.",
      "If CVS is found liable, it could face civil penalties for each unlawful prescription filled and treble damages and other penalties for each prescription reimbursed by federal health care programs.",
      "The company said it's cooperated with investigators.",
      "\u201cWe will defend ourselves vigorously against this misguided federal lawsuit, which follows on the heels of years of litigation over these issues by state and local governments \u2014 claims that already have been largely resolved by a global agreement with the participating state Attorneys General,\u201d said Amy Thibault, director of external communications for CVS in a written statement.",
      "Each of the prescriptions in question was for an FDA-approved opioid medication prescribed by a practitioner who the government itself licensed, authorized and empowered to write controlled-substance prescriptions, Thibault added.",
      "The filing of the complaint follows the announcement on Friday that the McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin.",
      "It\u2019s the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold companies accountable that officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of these deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really worth thinking carefully about the risk and the benefit of collecting data in this new environment,\u201d said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights and does its own voluntary surveys of abortion providers.",
      "A handful of Democratic-controlled states have reduced reporting requirements in recent years out of concern about privacy and also considering the burden it puts on providers to collect it all. Republican-run states generally ask for a lot, though many of them have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy or after roughly the first six weeks, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "Michigan just released 2023 abortion data but is not collecting it at all going forward. Illinois has switched to aggregate reporting instead of requiring providers to send information about each individual abortion. Minnesota has reduced the number of questions they require to be tallied, eliminating data on marital status, race and ethnicity, among others.",
      "New York City has also cut back on asking the patient demographics questions.",
      "Abortion access has been shifting around the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Starting in the months before the Supreme Court ruling was released, the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion rights, launched regular surveys of abortion providers about their work and has generally released the results quarterly. One of the lead researchers, University of California, San Francisco, public health social scientist Ushma Upadhyay, said the next report won't come out as soon as it otherwise might have.",
      "\u201cWe are delaying our next release to give providers time to adjust to the tenor of the new administration,\u201d she said, noting that she hopes providers continue to participate in the survey.",
      "Over the past two years, the report has shown that while abortions have become rare in the states where bans are in place, they've increased slightly overall as people travel for procedures or obtain pills via telemedicine.",
      "Arizona's policy changes have been more turbulent than most. Providers stopped offering abortions in 2022 amid legal questions about whether an 1864 ban on nearly all abortions was valid, then resumed them. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ruled that the old law could be enforced, but then put the start of enforcement on hold. Before it took effect, the state \u2014 aided by some GOP lawmakers joining Democrats \u2014 repealed the old law. And in November, voters added a right to abortion to the state constitution.",
      "The Arizona data made public on Wednesday reflects the policy changes \u2014 with the state going from just under 14,000 abortions in 2021 to 11,400 in 2022 to 12,700 last year. The 2024 numbers are not in the state's report, which is published by the Department of Health Services.",
      "The report began with voluntary participation from licensed providers in 1976 and became mandatory in 2010. The state collects detailed information, including whether minors have parental consent, as well as the age, marital status, and race and ethnicity of the patient. It also reports how many previous abortions and live births the patient has had, how far along in pregnancy she was, and whether the abortion involved a procedure or pills. But the data does not include the patient's name, address, birthdate or Social Security number.",
      "For years, four states with generally expansive abortion rights laws have skipped participating in the federal government's roundup of state data. California and Maryland don't collect the data. New Hampshire and New Jersey make it voluntary for hospitals and other providers to supply it.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law and an abortion law scholar, said states don't need to know personal information such as the name and address of people who receive abortions. And while it's useful to report basic information about abortion, she said, there are risks for abortion rights advocates, particularly in the reports from states with bans where the data mostly shows how often abortions are provided through exceptions.",
      "\u201cThe tension we find ourselves in is patient privacy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also the looming allegation that exceptions are being misused.\u201d"

      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:54:27 -0500",
    "summary": "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
    "story": [
      "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
      "WASHINGTON -- During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs. But not when it comes to Biden's Gender Policy Council, which has worked to defend reproductive health care in the face of growing restrictions.",
      "The first-of-its kind office was an effort to drive policy that would make life better for women and girls in the U.S. and in the world. Over the past four years, it has sought to advance reproductive freedom, make pay more equitable and increase participation by women in the workforce. It was formed through an executive order by Biden in September 2021, and members of his Cabinet have representatives on the council.",
      "It's not unusual for new presidents to remake the West Wing to suit incoming priorities, and the Trump administration hasn't said one way or the other whether the council will remain. But Project 2025, a conservative handbook written for an incoming GOP administration, has said it should be axed \u2014 in part because it promotes abortion. And Biden officials are concerned about what that might mean \u2014 particularly as reproductive health continues to worsen for some women across the nation following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Project 2025 is a detailed, 920-page roadmap for governing, led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals include ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists and reversing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medications used in abortions. The president-elect has claimed he has never seen it, but plenty of members of his incoming administration have written sections and many of Trump\u2019s policies align.",
      "According to the handbook, the incoming president should revoke the executive order that created the Gender Policy Council, \u201cand every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues.\u201d",
      "It mischaracterizes the office as one with a principal intent of \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. The document also claims that by abolishing the office, Trump would \u201celiminate central promotion of abortion\" and \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education.\u201d",
      "It suggests, instead, that the president should spend time developing new structures dedicated to \u201cpromoting life and strengthening the family.\u201d",
      "Other presidents have carved out space for women's issues, but there has been no office within the West Wing specifically dedicated to advancing policy changes on behalf of women. Since the creation of the office, Biden has signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum directing his administration to protect access to reproductive health, among other efforts.",
      "The council has also worked to address health disparities. Biden last year announced a women\u2019s health research initiative at wife Jill\u2019s urging that has invested nearly $1 billion. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied.",
      "The council has also worked to lower child care payments and call for better paid leave for families.",
      "\u201cThe reality of the situation is that we\u2019ve done a huge amount that helps not only women \u2014 women and families \u2014 but really it helps our society as a whole,\" said Jen Klein, the chairwoman of the council.",
      "Klein believes that some of the work of the Gender Policy Council won\u2019t be undone. The Violence Against Women Act, for example, was reauthorized in 2022. And other issues have long been considered bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is Trump's nominee for secretary of state, co-sponsored the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, a bipartisan law signed by Trump that seeks to protect women and girls globally from violence and include women in conflict prevention.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point in American history where many of these issues were not only bipartisan, but where the business case had been made,\u201d Klein said. \u201cCare is a perfect example of that. If you think about the trajectory of the last 10 years, these are issues that are no longer seen as women\u2019s issues.\u201d",
      "But reproductive health care is much more contentious. The Gender Policy Council was formed before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022. Since then, as states have restricted access to health care, access to abortion and other reproductive care has become a major focal point for the office.",
      "The council has spearheaded efforts throughout the administration to help safeguard access, including by working with the department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance reminding hospitals of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room. Women have been turned away during miscarriages and left bleeding in parking lots in part because of abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has waffled on abortion access particularly during his campaign. He has said that abortion limits should be left to the states, and has declined to endorse a national ban. Trump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral.",
      "Most recently, he told NBC that he was not likely to restrict access to medication abortion. \u201cI'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years, and the answer is no,\" he said. But \u201cthings do change.\u201d"

      "It's the first human case in the U.S. linked to exposure to backyard birds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Since March, more than 60 bird flu infections in people have been reported in the U.S., but previous illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "CDC officials said that bird flu is still mainly an animal health issues and that the risk to the general public remains low. There has been no documented spread of the virus from person to person, said the CDC's Dr. Demetre Daskalakis.",
      "The Louisiana illness comes weeks after Canadian officials reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu. In both instances, the illnesses were caused by a strain of the virus found in wild birds, not in cattle, officials said.",
      "On a call with reporters, CDC officials did not answer a question about whether the new U.S. case and the Canada case had any similarities or differences.",

      "Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers",
      "Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother\u2019s autopsy report.",
      "There it was, one devastating word: \u201caccident.\u201d The papers trembled in her hands.",
      "Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold\u2019s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff\u2019s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn\u2019t breathing.",
      "How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide.",
      "Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner\u2019s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight.",
      "\u201cNo more silence or complacency,\u201d she thought. \u201cNo sweeping it under the rug.\u201d",
      "In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died \u2014 what\u2019s known as the manner and cause of death.",
      "On TV dramas such as \u201cCSI\u201d or \u201cBones,\u201d facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found.",
      "That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren\u2019t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police.",
      "Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP\u2019s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use \u2014 even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill.",
      "Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon.",
      "The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement.",
      "The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI call it a crazy quilt,\u201d said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners\u2019 independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge.",
      "When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare \u2014 of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family\u2019s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher.",
      "\u201cI had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you\u2019d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime \u2014 police officer or not,\u201d Jen Dold said. \u201cSadly, we realized this was not the case.\u201d",
      "Jen Dold \u2014 11 years older than Alex \u2014 had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially.",
      "One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left.",
      "The county mental health department wouldn\u2019t send someone, saying Dold wasn\u2019t violent enough.",
      "When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment.",
      "Two Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door.",
      "Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold\u2019s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied.",
      "Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report.",
      "Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst yelling, shouting I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d one neighbor told an investigator.",
      "After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Jen Dold didn\u2019t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother\u2019s mental illness, she thought to protect officers.",
      "Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County\u2019s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he\u2019d weigh police force.",
      "Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn\u2019t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident.",
      "Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold\u2019s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied \u2014 Selove used it even though under his own office\u2019s policies intent \u201cneed not be present or proven\u201d for a homicide ruling.",
      "For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn\u2019t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it \u2014 and doing so has \u201csome value\u201d to reduce any appearance of a cover-up.",
      "Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization\u2019s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court.",
      "The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force.",
      "Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother\u2019s death accountable was a lawsuit.",
      "Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother\u2019s death, Deputy McGee \u2014 the first one into Dold\u2019s home \u2014 had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty.",
      "The county had settled that family\u2019s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help.",
      "As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold\u2019s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it.",
      "Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County.",
      "Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold\u2019s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident.",
      "\u201cI have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,\u201d Adams said.",
      "\u201cWhy do you say it\u2019s a homicide?\u201d the lawyer asked.",
      "\u201cBecause when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn\u2019t matter about the intent,\u201d Adams replied.",
      "The family hugged.",
      "\u201cWe just kept saying, \u2018Did he really just say that? Did he really just say \u2018homicide'?\u201d Jen Dold recalled.",
      "Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn\u2019t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove\u2019s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Selove said Adams\u2019 homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn\u2019t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him.",
      "The county offered Dold\u2019s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn\u2019t budge. She finally relented.",
      "\u201cThe process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,\u201d she said.",
      "When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold\u2019s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records.",
      "In the seven years since her brother\u2019s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe.",
      "A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner\u2019s report was different by just one word \u2014 homicide?",
      "While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials \u2014 the police chief or sheriff, the mayor \u2014 as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers.",
      "In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger.",
      "Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting.",
      "Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, \u201cI think they George Floyded him.\u201d",
      "The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner.",
      "Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers.",
      "\u201cGreat day!!\u201d Brave wrote in one. \u201cAfter our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.\u201d",
      "He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as \u201csuperhuman strength\u201d and high pain tolerance.",
      "Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what\u2019s known as prone position \u2014 the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP\u2019s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor.",
      "Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson\u2019s death was due to methamphetamine-induced \u201cpsychomotor agitation\u201d and \u201cphysical exertion with physical restraint.\u201d The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined \u2014 one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide.",
      "Miller didn\u2019t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to influence her \u2014 he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages.",
      "Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy.",
      "In a 2018 \u201cManaging Your Medical Examiner\u201d web presentation, a longtime member of the company\u2019s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. \u201cControl the narrative\u201d by getting the deceased\u2019s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are \u201chostile,\u201d line up police-friendly experts to counter them.",
      "Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not \u201cinfallible truth\u201d but rather \u201cdriven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.\u201d Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die \u201cwalking time bombs.\u201d",
      "Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths.",
      "One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause.",
      "\u201cDangerously close to intimidation,\u201d the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time.",
      "Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association\u2019s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they \u201csuffered consequences,\u201d including being fired.",
      "In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be \u201cindependent from law enforcement and prosecutors,\u201d and based on scientific evidence and research.",
      "Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes.",
      "Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show.",
      "After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state\u2019s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith\u2019s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification \u201cwrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts \u2026 to baselessly vilify police officers.\u201d",
      "The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he \u201cwas not pressuring anyone\u201d but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages.",
      "In March 2019, an officer\u2019s punch fractured a 54-year-old man\u2019s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington\u2019s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor.",
      "The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn\u2019s death was tragic but the medical examiner\u2019s report had \u201cconfusing and contradictory findings.\u201d",
      "Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont.",
      "An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement.",
      "State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas\u2019 justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties.",
      "In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner\u2019s office.",
      "The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be.",
      "The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field.",
      "Briones survived the wreck \u2014 but not the night.",
      "Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn\u2019t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late.",
      "Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently.",
      "The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths \u2014 typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system.",
      "Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner\u2019s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner\u2019s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide.",
      "In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that \u2014 at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches \u2014 Briones was \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d He ruled the death natural.",
      "The Briones family couldn\u2019t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn\u2019t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP\u2019s database and ruled none a homicide.",
      "In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP\u2019s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later \u2014 in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake\u2019s death a homicide attributable to tasing.",
      "All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County\u2019s four deaths was. Miami\u2019s chief medical examiner declined to comment.",
      "The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner\u2019s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother\u2019s death.",

      "A couple has dropped a lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule earlier this year that frozen embryos are what it called \"extrauterine children.\"",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A judge last week dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule that frozen embryos are \u201cextrauterine children,\u201d a decision that drew national attention and temporarily halted in vitro fertilization services in the state.",
      "A couple, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit over the accidental destruction of their last frozen embryo, asked to drop the suit. A judge granted the request and dismissed the case Friday, according to state court records. Two other couples had dropped similar lawsuits in August.",
      "The court order did not detail the reason for dropping the lawsuit or if a settlement had been reached. Trip Smalley, a lawyer representing the couple, did not immediately return an email and telephone message seeking comment.",
      "The three couples had their embryos destroyed in 2020 when a hospital patient wandered into the storage area. The patient opened the container, picked up embryos and dropped them to the floor.",
      "The Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that the three couples could pursue wrongful death claims for the destruction of the embryos. Justices, citing anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution, ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child, \u201capplies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.\u201d",
      "The decision became a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion and raised liability concerns for fertility clinics as they create, store and work with frozen embryos. Three large IVF providers in Alabama paused services in the wake of the ruling. Facing a public backlash to the decision, Alabama lawmakers approved immunity legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits and get IVF services restarted in the state.",
      "The couple, who had turned to IVF to have children, said in their 2021 lawsuit that the accident destroyed their final frozen embryo, which was being stored at the facility. Even though they had chosen not to implant it, \u201cthey considered this embryo a human being or life,\u201d their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit."

      "Indonesia's mining industry is rapidly expanding on demand for the minerals needed to help power the global energy transition, like nickel, cobalt and bauxite",
      "KABAENA, Indonesia -- The crystal blue waters that once surrounded Kabaena are murky brown now, and the octopi and colorful fish that locals used to catch nearby to eat and sell have fled. The lush seaweed they used to harvest is gone. And parents who grew up swimming happily in the Flores Sea now warn their children to stay out of the water for fear of itchy rashes or skin lesions.",
      "The people of Kabaena \u2014 including Indigenous Bajau, a group that has traditionally lived near and relied on the sea \u2014 are among what experts estimate are thousands of communities around Indonesia where traditional ways of life have been devastated by the impacts of a rapidly expanding mining industry. Most of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more.",
      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "On Kabaena, over 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres) of forest \u2014 including protected forest \u2014 were cleared by mining companies between 2001 to 2023, according to data analysis by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",
      "\u201c(I would) fish near there by setting a net,\u201d Ilyas, 70, said while pointing in front of his home. \u201cNow it\u2019s far away before (fish) are found.\u201d",
      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment. Mining company Anugrah Harisma Barakah \u2014 which caused the most deforestation on Kabaena, according to Satya Bumi \u2014 also did not answer the publicly listed phone number when AP made requests for interviews or comment.",
      "Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Teen drug use hasn\u2019t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "NEW YORK -- Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.",
      "About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn\u2019t used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That\u2019s the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.",
      "Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn\u2019t used any of those substances recently, another record. Among 8th graders, 90% didn\u2019t use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.",
      "The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they\u2019d used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.",
      "Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re seeing the start of something, or not.\"",
      "The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year\u2019s findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is \u201cone of the best, if not the best\" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.",
      "Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.",
      "As lockdowns ended, \u201cI think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.",
      "But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.",
      "Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.",
      "Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.",
      "\u201cSome teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,\" Clark said. \"It's a complicated relationship.\u201d",

      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- An Alabama woman is recovering well after a pig kidney transplant last month that freed her from eight years of dialysis, the latest effort to save human lives with animal organs.",
      "Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ \u2014 and notably, she isn\u2019t as sick as prior recipients who died within two months of receiving a pig kidney or heart.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a new beginning,\u201d Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, \u201cthe energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney \u2014 and to feel it \u2014 is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing for the first time,\u201d Montgomery said.",
      "Locke, who recently joined the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, visited last week to check her longtime patient's progress. Looney hugged her, saying, \u201cThank you for not giving up on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever,\u201d Locke responded.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "Here are takeaways from the AP\u2019s reporting on bunkers and the debate over the message building bunkers sends.",
      "The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern year after year introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",

      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",
      "If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",
      "Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Kennedy \u201ca truly dangerous\u201d choice.",
      "Besser, in an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, said Kennedy stands out as a \u201csingle potential Cabinet member who could do the most damage to the American people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Kennedy's arrival he was given a word of advice from one important voice: outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, who cautioned the nominee against views opposing the vaccine.",
      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",
      "\u201cWell, I think he\u2019ll have to address that,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d",
      "But hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a House member who has no vote in the confirmation process, has been influential in supporting and amplifying Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines.",
      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "Despite opposition in the GOP-controlled General Assembly for several years, Medicaid expansion in North Carolina passed with bipartisan support last year after Congress offered states more financial incentives to join the program. The federal government foots 90% of the expansion costs under the program.",
      "In just the first few weeks of the program's rollout, the state had 300,000 North Carolinians \u2014 half of its goal \u2014 enroll in Medicaid expansion. North Carolina is part of a handful of Southern states that now participate in the program.",
      "More than a third of expansion enrollees come from rural communities, according to Cooper's office. About 4.1 million prescriptions related to heart health, diabetes and other diseases have been filled so far because of the new coverage, the governor's office said."

      "The Arab Spring started in Tunisia more than 13 years ago. Until recently, the country was hailed as a role model in the transition to democracy. It held free elections and drafted a constitution lauded by Western rights groups.",
      "But since being elected in 2019, President Kais Saied has increased his powers in what activists call a backslide from democracy. Saied temporarily suspended the parliament, redrafted the constitution and launched a crackdown on his opponents, imprisoning hundreds allegedly for undermining state security \u2014 a claim autocrats have long used to stamp out dissent.",
      "The military has been the main power player in Egypt. It seized direct control after 18 days of protests forced longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak to resign on Feb. 11, 2011.",
      "Within 15 months, parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The Muslim Brotherhood, the most powerful opposition force during Mubarak\u2019s era, swept both votes. Despite repeatedly insisting it wouldn't seek to dominate politics, it formed a majority in parliament and created a Brotherhood-led government.",
      "Over the next year, turmoil increased over accusations by opponents that the Brotherhood was unfairly imposing its will on the country, including writing an Islamist-leaning constitution. Many, including the large Coptic Christian minority, feared Islamist rule.",
      "Amid anti-Brotherhood protests, the military stepped in and removed President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013, a move supported by many secular parties and activists. It launched a ferocious crackdown on the Brotherhood, killing hundreds. Militant violence swelled with attacks on security forces and Christians.",
      "Military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sissi was elected president in 2014 and has since increased the influence of the army on the government and economy. The government has gone further than Mubarak did in stifling dissent, arresting Islamists and secular activists, and silencing media criticism."

      "Da Luz had been waiting since 2021, and traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) by bus from southern Brazil when his chance arrived to ascend with the assistance of an organization called the Inclusion Collective. Its volunteers on Dec. 18 surrounded and shouldered the weight of a specialized wheelchair, set inside a metal frame as they helped da Luz upward.",

      "Inclusion Collective started three years ago and has completed more than 50 hikes, 12 of which to Pedra da Gavea, plus others on less challenging trails, according to Bruna Souza, the group\u2019s administrator.",
      "\u201cWe can show that if we have the will, inclusion can happen anywhere, not just where there\u2019s a ramp,\u201d she told The Associated Press along the trail. \u201cIt\u2019s not just shopping centers you can go to; you can go to other places. It can be fun for everyone.\u201d",
      "Volunteers on Wednesday were mostly trail and climbing guides already familiar with the route.

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know it had so many challenges, and so many obstacles,\u201d he told the AP atop the mountain. \u201cToday, to be up here on Pedra da Gavea, together with this group that promotes inclusion, is the fulfilment of a dream.\u201d",
      "Alas, the peak was shrouded in clouds, leaving Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Ipanema beach and iconic Two Brothers Hill hidden away. It seemed da Luz wouldn\u2019t get to enjoy Pedra da Gavea\u2019s majestic view.",
      "But within mere minutes, the clouds parted and some sunlight filtered down from the heavens, maybe just for him.",
      "\u201cEven in this, God was generous,\u201d da Luz said. \u201cLook there, what an incredible view. What a marvelous vision!\u201d"

      "BANGKOK -- A powerful ethnic armed group in western Myanmar claimed Friday to have scored a major victory in the war against the ruling military, even as neighboring nations at a meeting in Thailand were discussing efforts to end the conflict peacefully.",
      "The capture by the Arakan Army of a strategically important regional army headquarters in Rakhine state would put it a step closer to seizing control of the entire state, a goal not achieved by any of the several other rebel groups in other parts of Myanmar.",
      "Rakhine has become a focal point for Myanmar\u2019s nationwide civil war, in which pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces seeking autonomy battle the country\u2019s military rulers, who took power in 2021 after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.",
      "The apparent fall of the military\u2019s western command headquarters is the latest in a series of significant setbacks for the military government that began more than a year ago when a rebel alliance including the Arakan Army captured military bases, command centers, and strategic towns and cities along the Chinese border in Shan state in northeastern Myanmar.",
      "In August this year, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, another force in the rebel alliance, was the first group to seize a regional command headquarters, in the city of Lashio in the northeast. Myanmar\u2019s military has 14 important regional commands across the country.",
      "Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press by audio message from an undisclosed location that his group had \u201ccompletely captured and controlled the entire western regional military headquarters based in Ann township\u201d on Friday at noon.",
      "Most of the township was captured two weeks ago, leaving the headquarters encircled. The headquarters' deputy commander, Brig. Gen. Thaung Tun, and its chief operating officer, Brig. Gen. Kyaw Kyaw Than, were among those taken prisoner, Khaing Thukha said.",
      "The headquarters had overseen operations in Rakhine and the southern part of neighboring Chin state, as well as Myanmar\u2019s territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal.",
      "The military government issued no news about the latest development, which could not be independently confirmed, because access to the internet and mobile phone services in the area is mostly cut off. The Arakan Army in its past official announcements has generally been conservative in its victory claims.",
      "The Arakan Army is the well-trained and well-armed military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority, and seeks autonomy from Myanmar\u2019s central government. In September it launched its effort to capture Ann, about 395 kilometers (245 miles) northwest of Yangon. It began its offensive in Rakhine in November last year, and has now gained control of 13 of 17 townships, along with one in neighboring Chin state.",
      "Rakhine, formerly known as Arakan, was the site of a brutal army counterinsurgency operation in 2017 that drove about 740,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to seek safety across the border in Bangladesh.",
      "The Arakan Army has made extensive use of social media to document its operations and in recent days has used it to encourage the army's holdouts at the headquarters to surrender.",
      "Separately in Thailand\u2019s capital Bangkok, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations met Friday to renew their efforts to help bring peace to Myanmar. The meeting was described as an extended informal consultation.",
      "ASEAN in early 2021 agreed on a \u201c Five-Point Consensus \u201d for peace, but the military leadership in Myanmar did virtually nothing to implement it, frustrating the group\u2019s fellow members to the extent they have excluded members of Myanmar\u2019s ruling military from attending their meetings. There were no representatives of Myanmar at Friday\u2019s meeting.",
      "The peace plan calls for the immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar, a dialogue among all concerned parties, mediation by an ASEAN special envoy, provision of humanitarian aid through ASEAN channels, and a visit to Myanmar by the special envoy to meet all concerned parties.",
      "The foreign ministers and senior officials attending the Bangkok meeting reaffirmed their backing for the Five-Point Consensus.",
      "Critics have expressed dissatisfaction at ASEAN\u2019s conciliatory approach to Myanmar\u2019s ruling generals. The military government is condemned by many countries and rights organizations for its brutal war and suppression of democracy.",
      "\u201cThe principle laid down by ASEAN includes the words to find a Myanmar-owned and -led solution,\" said Nay Phone Latt, a spokesperson for Myanmar's opposition National Unity Government, or NUG. \u201cTherefore, it will never get a Myanmar-owned and -led solution by working side by side with the terrorist military group that is not representing the people and killing them every day, instead of dealing with the revolutionary forces, including the NUG, which represents the people of Myanmar.\"",
      "The NUG operates as a shadow government and stakes a claim to greater legitimacy than the ruling military.",
      "Bryony Lau, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, told The Associated Press that \u201cASEAN has needed to shake up its approach to Myanmar\u2019s crisis.\"",

      "According to a new report released Friday, the World Food Program said 3.4 million people are currently facing \u201cemergency levels of hunger\u201d in the region, representing a 70% increase in such cases since the summer.",
      "The report said conflict, displacement, economic instability and severe climate shocks are driving food insecurity. The ongoing conflict in the Sahel, as well as the Sudanese civil war, have forcibly displaced over 10 million people across the region. Massive flooding in Nigeria and Chad earlier this year has made the situation acute.",
      "Although the numbers are staggering, the new report reduces last year's estimate of the number of people facing food insecurity by 7.7 million. The WFP attributes the drop to better-than-average rainfall and marginal security improvements, which are unlikely to continue improving.",
      "Still, the WFP report says food insecurity will next year touch nearly one in ten people in West and Central Africa that the World Bank estimates is home to over half a billion people.",
      "Margot van der Velden, WFP\u2019s regional director for Western Africa, said the \u201cvicious cycle of hunger\u201d in the region can be broken with better planning and preparedness.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s anti-terrorism court on Friday convicted eight people of involvement in the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty four years ago.",
      "Paty was killed outside his school near Paris on Oct. 16, 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police.",
      "Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November are accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organizing a hate campaign online before the murder took place.",
      "The shocking death of the 47-year-old Paty left an imprint on France, and several schools are now named after him.",
      "Prosecutors requested sentences ranging from 18 months suspended imprisonment to 16 years in prison against the defendants. They include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped purchase weapons for the attack and the father of a schoolgirl whose lies started the fatal spiral of events.",
      "The national anti-terrorism prosecutor had asked the court to downgrade the offenses of four of the eight defendants, prompting ire from Paty's family.",
      "\u201cIt's more than a disappointment,\u201d Paty's sister Micka\u00eblle had told broadcaster TF1. \u201cIn a moment like this, it feels like one is fighting for nothing.\u201d",
      "Also, the public prosecutor dropped the charge of complicity in favor of a lower charge of association with a terrorist enterprise against the two young men accused of providing the logistical support to the killer. He asked for 14 years in prison for Na\u00efm Boudaoud and 16 years for Azim Epsirkhanov.",
      "The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty\u2019s death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists.",
      "The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty\u2019s killing reinforced the French state\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life.",
      "Much attention at the trial focused on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty\u2019s class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020.",
      "Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that \u201cthis sick man\u201d needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina\u2019s daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question.",
      "Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom.",
      "An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher\u2019s head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed.",
      "Chnina is accused of alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. The public prosecutor requested a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for him",
      "His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty\u2019s school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet.",
      "Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France although he had been dismissed from that role, is another key figure in the trial. He filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a \u201cthug\u201d multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media. Prosecutors have requested a 12-year sentence for him.",
      "Some of the defendants expressed regrets and claimed their innocence on the eve of the verdict. They did not convince Paty's family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that really shocks the family,\u201d lawyer Virginie Le Roy said. \u201cYou get the feeling that those in the box are absolutely unwilling to admit any responsibility whatsoever. Apologies are pointless, they won\u2019t bring Samuel back, but explanations are precious to us. But, unfortunately I have to make a more than mixed assessment. We haven\u2019t had many explanations of the facts.\u201d"

      "At issue are three bills that the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, was trying to push through, including one that critics say would paralyze the Constitutional Court. The legislature approved one bill that would stiffen the requirements for voter petitions to recall elected officials, and debate on the other two was continuing into the night. The third bill would redistribute tax revenues by giving a larger share to local governments.",

      "At least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine\u2019s air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said, and falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts.",

      "During the almost three years since the war began Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Meanwhile Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia's bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country\u2019s war effort.",
      "The falling debris in Kyiv smashed into the city center, causing damage to around two dozen high-rise office buildings as well as the Catholic Church of St. Nicholas, which is a city landmark, and the Kyiv National Linguistic University.",
      "What may have been the blast wave from an intercepted low-flying missile also blew out windows or caused other damage at six embassies, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.",
      "The Russian Ministry of Defense said the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia's Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said.",
      "That day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country's war effort.",

      "That development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile, called Oreshnik, for the first time. President Vladimir Putin suggested the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used for a second time.",
      "Answering the Ukrainian attack on Rostov on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it carried out a group strike with \u201chigh-precision, long-range weapons\u201d on the command center of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency and another location where it said Ukraine\u2019s Neptune missile systems are designed and produced.",

      "Israelis are increasingly moving out of the country since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack shattered any sense of safety",
      "LONDON -- Leaving Israel is easier, Shira Z. Carmel thinks, by saying it's just for now. But she knows better.",
      "For the Israeli-born singer and an increasing number of relatively well-off Israelis, the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack shattered any sense of safety and along with it, Israel's founding promise: to be the world's safe haven for Jews. That day, thousands of Hamas militants blew past the country's border defenses, killed 1,200 people and dragged 250 more into Gaza in a siege that caught the Israeli army by surprise and stunned a nation that prides itself on military prowess. This time, during what became known as Israel's 9/11, the army didn't come for hours.",
      "Ten days later, a pregnant Carmel, her husband and their toddler boarded a flight to Australia, which was looking for people in her husband's profession. And they spun the explanation to friends and family as something other than permanent \u2014 \u201crelocation\" is the easier-to-swallow term \u2014 acutely aware of the familial strain and the shame that have shadowed Israelis who leave for good.",
      "\u201cWe told them we're going to get out of the line of fire for awhile,\u201d Carmel said more than a year later from her family's new home in Melbourne. \u201cIt wasn't a hard decision. But it was very hard to talk to them about it. It was even hard to admit it to ourselves.\"",
      "Thousands of Israelis have left the country since Oct. 7, 2023, according to government statistics and immigration tallies released by destination countries such as Canada and Germany. There's concern about whether it will drive a \u201cbrain drain\u201d in sectors like medicine and tech. Migration experts say it's possible people leaving Israel will surpass the number of immigrants to Israel in 2024, according to Sergio DellaPergola, a statistician and professor emeritus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.",
      "\u201cIn my view, this year people entering will be smaller than the total of the exit,\" he said. \u201cAnd this is quite unique in the existence of the State of Israel.\u201d",
      "The Oct. 7 effect on Israeli emigration is enough for prominent Israelis to acknowledge the phenomenon publicly \u2014 and warn of rising antisemitism elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThere is one thing that worries me in particular: talks about leaving the country. This must not happen,\u201d former premier Naftali Bennett, a staunch critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, tweeted in June after a conversation with friends who were leaving. Israel, he wrote, needs to retain the talent. \u201cWho wants to return to the days of the wandering Jew, without real freedom, without a state, subject to every anti-Semitic whim?\u201d",
      "Thousands of Israelis have opted to pay the financial, emotional and social costs of moving out since the Oct. 7 attack, according to government statistics and families who spoke to The Associated Press in recent months after emigrating to Canada, Spain and Australia. Israel's overall population continues to grow toward 10 million people.",
      "But it's possible that 2024 ends with more Israelis leaving the country than coming in. That's even as Israel and Hezbollah reached a fragile ceasefire along the border with Lebanon and Israel and Hamas inch toward a pause in Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics estimated in September that 40,600 Israelis departed long-term over the first seven months of 2024, a 59% increase over the same period a year earlier, when 25,500 people left. Monthly, 2,200 more people departed this year than in 2023, CBS reported.",
      "The Israeli Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, which does not deal with people leaving, said more than 33,000 people have moved to Israel since the start of the war, about on par with previous years. The interior minister refused to comment for this story.",
      "The numbers are equally dramatic in destination countries. More than 18,000 Israelis applied for German citizenship in 2024, more than double the same period in 2023 and three times that of the year before, the Interior Ministry reported in September.",
      "Canada, which has a three-year work visa program for Israelis and Palestinians fleeing the war, received 5,759 applications for work permits from Israeli citizens between January and October this year, the government told The Associated Press. In 2023, that number was 1,616 applications, and a year earlier the tally was 1,176 applications, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.",
      "Other clues, too, point to a notable departure of Israelis since the Oct. 7 attacks. Gil Fire, deputy director of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, said that some of its star specialists with fellowship postings of a few years in other countries began to waver about returning.",
      "\u201cBefore the war, they always came back and it was not really considered an option to stay. And during the war we started to see a change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said to us, \u2018We will stay another year, maybe two years, maybe more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Fire says it\u2019s \u201can issue of concern\u201d enough for him to plan in-person visits with these doctors in the coming months to try to draw them back to Israel.",
      "Michal Harel, who moved with her husband to Toronto in 2019, said that almost immediately after the attacks the phone began ringing \u2014 with other Israelis seeking advice about moving to Canada. On Nov. 23, 2023, the couple set up a website to help Israelis navigate moving, which can cost at least 100,000 Israeli shekels, or about $28,000, Harel and other Israeli relocation experts said.",
      "Not everyone in Israel can just pack up and move overseas. Many of those who have made the move have foreign passports, jobs at multinational corporations or can work remotely. People in Gaza have even less choice. The vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by relentless Israeli bombing since Oct. 7, 2023, yet no one has been able to leave the enclave since May. Before then, at least 100,000 Palestinians are believed to have left Gaza.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say Israeli bombing has killed more than 45,000 people.",
      "Speaking by phone last month, Harel reported that the site has received views from 100,000 unique visitors and 5,000 direct contacts in 2024 alone.",
      "\u201cIt's people who want to move quickly with families, to wake up in the morning and enjoy life,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now (in Israel), it's trauma, trauma, trauma.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome of them,\u201d Harel added, \"they want to keep everything a secret.\u201d",
      "Aliya \u2014 the Hebrew term for used for immigration, literally the \u201cascent\u201d of Jews into Israel \u2014 has always been part of the country's plan. But \u201cyerida\u201d \u2014 the term used for leaving the country, literally the \u201cdescent\u201d of Jews from Israel to the diaspora, emphatically has not.",
      "For Israel's first decades of independence, the government strongly discouraged departing Israelis, who were seen in some cases as cowardly and even treasonous. A sacred trust and a social contract took root in Israeli society. The terms go \u2014 or went \u2014 like this: Israeli citizens would serve in the military and pay high taxes. In exchange, the army would keep them safe. Meanwhile, it\u2019s every Jew\u2019s obligation to stay, work and fight for Israel\u2019s survival.",
      "\u201cEmigration was a threat, especially in the early years (when) there were problems of nation-building. In later decades, Israel became more established and more self-confident,\u201d said Ori Yehudai, a professor of Israel studies at Ohio State University and the author of \u201cLeaving Zion,\u201d a history of Israeli emigration. The sense of shame is more of a social dynamic now, he said, but \u201cpeople still feel they have to justify their decision to move.\u201d",
      "Shira Carmel says she has no doubt about her decision. She'd long objected to Netanyahu's government's efforts to overhaul the legal system, and was one of the first women to don the blood-red \"Handmaid's Tale\" robes that became a fixture of the anti-government protests of 2023. She was terrified as a new mom, and a pregnant one, during the Hamas attack, and appalled at having to tell her toddler that they were gathering in the bomb shelter for \u201chugging parties\" with the neighbors. This was not the life she wanted.",
      "Meanwhile, Australia beckoned. Carmel's brother had lived there for two decades. The couple had the equivalent of a green card due to Carmel's husband's profession. In the days after the attack, Carmel's brother alerted her to the possibility of a flight out of Israel for free, if on very short notice, which she confirmed with the Australian embassy in Israel. Basic logic, she says, pointed toward moving.",
      "And yet.",
      "Carmel recalls the frenzied hours before the flight out in which she said to her husband in the privacy of their bedroom: \u201cMy God, are we really doing this?\u201d",
      "They decided not to decide, opting instead for: \u201cWe're just getting on a plane for now, being grateful.\u201d They packed lightly.",
      "On the ground half a world away, weeks became months. And they decided: \u201cI\u2019m not going to go back to try to give birth in the war.\u201d In December, they told their families back in Israel that they were staying \u201cfor now.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don't define it as \u2018forever,\u2019\" Carmel said Tuesday. \u201cBut we are for sure staying for the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "Three days after the violent magnitude 7.3 quake struck just offshore from Vanuatu's most populous island, uncertainty persisted about the number of people dead and wounded. Damage was concentrated in Port Vila\u2019s downtown area where eight survivors have been rescued from collapsed buildings, according to the United Nations.",

      "Rain forecast in the next few days threatens to worsen landslides prompted by the quake. They included a major slip that has blocked Vanuatu\u2019s sea port. The airport, currently open only for humanitarian flights, will resume commercial airline operations on Sunday, according to local news outlets.",
      "It prompted quiet hope for a return to normal among residents accustomed to life in one of the world\u2019s most natural disaster-prone countries. But analysts said the problems that afflicted Vanuatu before Tuesday\u2019s quake were likely to hinder recovery.",
      "Vanuatu is an scenic, sprawling archipelago covering a vast expanse of South Pacific Ocean that lies between Australia and Fiji. More than 80 coral and volcanic islands are home to 330,000 people.",
      "Perched on the Pacific ring of fire \u2013 a belt of tectonic plates and volcanoes \u2013 Vanuatu is regularly jolted by earthquakes, though none in living memory as large as Tuesday\u2019s.",
      "The country is also among the world\u2019s most imperiled by climate change. Earlier this month Vanuatu led a group of small island nations in a landmark case on the matter in the top United Nations court.",
      "The country's envoys argued that as rising seas threaten the existence of Vanuatu and other nations, major polluting countries should be ordered to take more responsibility for curbing their emissions.",
      "Lush tropical forests and azure seas make the country a popular destination for holidaymakers from Australia and New Zealand, and tourism accounts for about 40% of the economy. The other major contributor is agriculture, with products exported or sold to tourist resorts.",
      "Disasters of recent years have frustrated its growth. Visitor numbers dwindled during the coronavirus pandemic and had barely started to recover before three major cyclones in 2023 dealt another blow. In May, the country\u2019s national airline collapsed.",
      "Vanuatu is currently led by a caretaker government after President Nikenike Vurobaravu dissolved Parliament in November as Prime Minister Charlot Salwai faced a no-confidence vote.",
      "Salwai, now the caretaker leader, is Vanuatu\u2019s fourth Prime Minister in four years, with his predecessor toppled in a confidence vote in 2023 after a month in office. A snap election is due in January.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most turbulent political systems in this part of the world,\u201d said Riley Duke, a Pacific analyst at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. The political chaos has bred a \u201cpermanent short-term focus\u201d, he said, and has deterred some funders of badly-needed development projects.",
      "Vanuatu has become part of a wider strategic battle for the Pacific in recent years as western countries seek to counter China\u2019s growing influence. Australia is still Vanuatu\u2019s biggest donor, but the government has increasingly looked to China to fund infrastructure and building projects including work this year on a presidential palace.",
      "In the process, it has amassed sizeable loans and was rated at high risk of debt distress by the International Monetary Fund before this week\u2019s quake.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a drive by the next government to secure additional financing, which opens the door to more interest in external financing,\u201d said Duke. \u201cThat obviously has secondary effects for geopolitics.\u201d"

The agreement includes provisions for VW to shed more than 35,000 jobs through early retirement and buyouts by 2030.",

But the company recently proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said.",
      "\u201cUnion baristas know their value, and they\u2019re not going to accept a proposal that doesn\u2019t treat them as true partners,\" said Lynne Fox, president of Workers United.",
      "Seattle-based Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. Starbucks has nearly 10,000 company-owned stores in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,\u201d Starbucks said in a statement.",
      "Starbucks said it already offers pay and benefits \u2014 including free college tuition and paid family leave \u2014 worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "The strikes aren't the first during Starbucks' busy holiday season. In November 2023, thousands of workers at more than 200 stores walked out on Red Cup Day, a day when the company usually gives away thousands of reusable cups. Hundreds of workers also went on strike in June 2023 to protest after the union said Starbucks banned Pride displays at some stores.",
      "The union and the company struck a different tone early this year, when they returned to the bargaining table and pledged to reach an agreement. Starbucks said it has held nine bargaining sessions with the union since April, and has reached more than 30 agreements with the union.",
      "But the two sides now appear to be at an impasse.",
      "\u201cIn a year when Starbucks invested so many millions in top executive talent, it has failed to present the baristas who make its company run with a viable economic proposal,\u201d said Fatemeh Alhadjaboodi, a Starbucks barista from Texas and bargaining delegate, in a statement."

      "Creamy, delectable \u2013 and pricey",
      "PARIS -- Pastry chef Arnaud Delmontel rolls out dough for croissants and pain au chocolat that later emerge golden and fragrant from the oven in his Paris patisserie.",
      "The price for the butter so essential to the pastries has shot up in recent months, by 25% since September alone, Delmontel says. But he is refusing to follow some competitors who have started making their croissants with margarine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a distortion of what a croissant is,\u201d Delmontel said. \"A croissant is made with butter.\u201d",
      "One of life\u2019s little pleasures \u2014 butter spread onto warm bread or imbuing cakes and seared meats with its rich flavor \u2014 has gotten more expensive across Europe in the last year. After a stretch of post-pandemic inflation that the war in Ukraine worsened, the booming cost of butter is another blow for consumers with holiday treats to bake.",
      "Across the 27-member European Union, the price of butter rose 19% on average from October 2023 to October 2024, including by 49% in Slovakia, and 40% in Germany and the Czech Republic, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the EU's executive arm. Reports from individual countries indicate the cost has continued to go up in the months since.",
      "In Germany, a 250-gram (8.8-ounce) block of butter now generally costs between 2.40 and 4 euros ($2.49-$4.15), depending on the brand and quality.",
      "The increase is the result of a global shortage of milk caused by declining production, including in the United States and New Zealand, one of the world\u2019s largest butter exporters, according to economist Mariusz Dziwulski, a food and agricultural market analyst at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw.",
      "European butter typically has a higher fat content than the butter sold in the United States. It also is sold by weight in standard sizes, so food producers can\u2019t hide price hikes by reducing package sizes, something known as \u201cshrinkflation. \u201d",
      "A butter shortage in France in the 19th century led to the invention of margarine, but the French remain some of the continent's heaviest consumers of butter, using the ingredient with abandon in baked goods and sauces.",
      "Butter is so important in Poland that the government keeps a stockpile of it in the country's strategic reserves, as it does national gas and COVID-19 vaccines. The government announced Tuesday that it was releasing some 1,000 tons of frozen butter to stabilize prices.",
      "The price of butter rose 11.4% between early November and early December in Poland, and 49.2% over the past year to nearly 37 Polish zlotys, or $9 per kilo (2.2 pounds) for the week ending Dec. 8, according to the National Support Center for Agriculture, a government agency.",
      "\u201cEvery month butter gets more expensive,\u201d Danuta Osinska, a 77-year-old Polish woman, said while shopping recently at a discount grocery chain in Warsaw.",
      "She and her husband love butter \u2014 on bread, in scrambled eggs, in creamy desserts. But they also struggle to pay for medications on their meager pensions. So the couple is eating less butter and more margarine, even though they find the taste of the substitute spread inferior.",
      "\u201cThere is no comparison,\u201d Osinska said. \u201cThings are getting harder and harder.\u201d",
      "The cost of butter in Poland has become a political issue. With a presidential election scheduled next year, opponents of centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk are trying to blame him and his Civic Platform party. Other Poles want to blame the national bank's governor, who hails from an opposing political camp.",
      "Some consumers decide where to shop based on the price of butter, which has led to price wars between grocery chains that in some cases kept prices artificially low in the past to the detriment of dairy farmers, according to Agnieszka Maliszewska, the director of the Polish Chamber of Milk.",
      "Maliszewska thinks domestic, EU-specific and global issues explain butter inflation. She argues that the primary cause in Poland is a shortage of milk fat due to dairy farmers shutting down their enterprises because of slim profit markets and hard work.",
      "She and others also cite higher energy costs from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine as impacting milk production. There is some debate about the potential effect of climate change. Maliszewska doesn't see a link.",
      "Economist Dziwulski, however, thinks droughts may be a factor in reducing production. Falling milk prices last year also discouraged investments and pushed dairy producers in the EU to make more cheese, which offered better profitability, he said.",
      "An outbreak of bluetongue disease, an insect-borne viral disease that is harmless to humans but can be fatal for sheep, cows and goats, may also play a role, Dziwulski said.",
      "The U.S. saw a butter price spike in 2022, when the average price jumped 33% to $4.88 per pound over the course of the year, according to government data. Dairy farmers struggled with feed costs and hot temperatures.",
      "U.S. butter prices fell in 2023 before rising again this year, hitting a peak of $5 per pound in September. Higher grocery prices in general weighed on U.S. voters during the presidential election in November.",
      "Southern European countries, which rely far more heavily on olive oil, are less affected by the butter inflation \u2014 or they just don't consider it as important since they consume so much less.",
      "Since last year the cost of butter shot up 44% on average in Italy, according to dairy market analysis firm CLAL. Italy is Europe's seventh-largest butter producer, but olive oil is the preferred fat, even for some desserts. The price of butter therefore is not causing the same alarm there as it is in butter-addicted parts of Europe.",
      "Delmontel, the Paris pastry chef, said the rising costs put business owners like him under pressure. Along with refusing to switch out butter for margarine, he has not reduced the size of his croissants. But some other French bakers are making smaller pastries to control costs, he said.",
      "\u201cOr else you squeeze it out of your profit margin,\u201d Delmontel said.",

      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year\u2019s Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\u201cAirline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\u201d AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation\u2019s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \u201cinterline agreements\u201d that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\u201cWhen they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\u201d said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\u201cThey will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn\u2019t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\u201d TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \u201ccontinue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\u201d spokesperson Diaz said. \u201cAirport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\u201d",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\u201cBecause travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\u201d Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \u201cIf you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\"",

Trump on Thursday declined to say if he had confidence in Johnson, telling NBC News, \u201cWe'll see.\u201d And there was no clear path to keeping the government open beyond Friday, raising the specter of a government shutdown heading into the holidays. Congressional Democrats mocked their GOP counterparts, with several suggesting Trump had been relegated to vice president.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the Elon Musk presidency,\u201d Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California wrote on X.",
      "What was clear, though, is Musk\u2019s ascendance as a political force, a level of influence enabled by his great wealth. In addition to owning X, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and Space X.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt he does wield a lot of influence over Republicans right now due to his proximity to Trump,\u201d said Chris Pack, former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- American farmers, small business owners and wildfire survivors are among those who will suffer if Congress cannot agree on a new spending bill after President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected a bipartisan plan that included more than $100 billion in disaster aid.",
      "A mayor in Hawaii is watching closely to see what happens because a potential allocation of $1.6 billion in funding is on the line. It's critical to ongoing disaster recovery efforts from the 2023 Maui fire, which proved to be the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century.",
      "\u201cI think what funding does is provides people with hope so they can plan for their future,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cAnd the longer we go without funding, the longer people wallow and wonder, is there a chance? Is there a path? Do I cut my losses? Do I leave?\u201d",
      "While money from the Federal Emergency Management Administration has provided temporary relief, the disaster recovery funding was intended for long-term needs such as housing assistance and rebuilding infrastructure, he said. The historic town of Lahaina is still struggling after the August 2023 fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes, leaving behind an estimated $5.5 billion in damage.",
      "The money is also urgently needed after Hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the southeastern United States one after the other this fall. Helene alone was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, killing at least 221 people. Nearly half were in North Carolina where flooding and winds caused an estimated $60 billion in damage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tracking this bill like a hawk right now, to be honest,\u201d Asheville Tea Co. founder and CEO Jessie Dean said. \u201cI think a lot of us are.\u201d",
      "Flooding from Helene in September washed away the company's building along with all of its equipment and inventory. Her small business employs 11 people directly and also works with small farmers in the area to supply the herbs for its teas.",
      "On Thursday, Republicans released a new version of the bill to keep the government operating and restore the disaster aid, but it faced an uncertain pathway. While President-elect Donald Trump lauded the revised plan, Democratic legislative leaders indicated they were opposed. Some Democratic support would likely be needed in the face of opposition by hardline members of the GOP.",
      "\u201cI realize there are other distractions that are going on, but I would just bring everybody back to their commitment to help disaster survivors,\u201d said Bissen, Maui's mayor. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really all this is. We have a proven and established, legitimate disaster that took place. And we are coming up on 16 months, which no other disasters ever had to wait that long for.\u201d",
      "In Asheville, Dean is extremely grateful for support the business has received from customers and nonprofits that is helping it stay afloat right now, but more is needed. So far she has received no money from the U.S. Small Business Administration after applying for a disaster relief loan. Neither have any of the other business owners she knows.",
      "\u201cIn day to day life right now, I'm talking to friends every day who are struggling with the decision around whether or not to continue to run their business, whether or not they can,\" she said.",
      "Many farmers are in the same boat, since about $21 billion of the disaster aid in the earlier version of the bill was assistance for them.",
      "\u201cWithout federal disaster money right now, or without some assistance, people like me will not be farming much longer,\u201d Georgia pecan farmer Scott Hudson said. He farms 2,600 acres (1,050 hectares) of pecans across five counties in southeastern Georgia that were hammered by Hurricane Helene.",
      "\u201cWe lost thousands of trees that will be decades before they are back to where they were the night before the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we lost upwards to 70% of the crop in certain counties.\u201d",
      "Some of his fellow farmers fared even worse.",
      "\u201cWhether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican, the farmers need this money,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican ag needs this money ... not to be profitable, to just stay in business.\u201d",
      "People like retired engineer Thomas Ellzey are also counting on disaster aid. He has been living in a mud-filled house in Fairview, North Carolina, for almost three months. Although he pre-qualified for a low-interest loan from the SBA that helps homeowners rebuild, officials have told him the agency does not have the money and is waiting on Congress to act.",
      "Ellzey is 71 years old and said he budgeted carefully for his retirement, trying to prepare for every possible emergency that could come up once he stopped working. But he couldn\u2019t have predicted a hurricane, he said.",
      "\u201cEverything I owned was paid for, including my cars, the house, the land. I had no bills,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing back in debt is kind of rough at my age.\u201d",
      "The earlier version of the spending bill included included funding for low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners trying to rebuild after a disaster; money for rebuilding damaged roads and highways; and funds for helping communities recover through block grants administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The block grant money is one of the key funds for homeowners who don\u2019t have insurance or enough insurance recover from disasters.",
      "Although hurricanes Helene and Milton are the most recent large natural disasters to hit the U.S., a lot of the money was intended more generally for relief from any major disaster in recent years, including droughts and wildfires.",
      "Stan Gimont is senior adviser for community recovery at Hagerty Consulting who used to run the community development block grant program at HUD. He noted that the country is still paying for disasters that happened while it simultaneously prepares for events that will happen in the future.",
      "The Maui fire is a clear example.",
      "\u201cIt took a year to clean that up and to get it to a point where they have removed all the debris, all the toxic materials and the burned up cars, whatever was in those houses,\u201d Gimont said. \u201cSo even though that event occurred in the past, the bills for that are going to come due in the future.\u201d",

      "Packaged foods in the U_S_ must follow new rules in order to call themselves \u201chealthy.\u201d",
      "Packaged foods in the U.S. will have to follow new rules in order to call themselves \u201chealthy,\u201d according to changes finalized Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "It\u2019s an update of the agency\u2019s definition originally devised 30 years ago. The move is aimed at helping Americans navigate food labels at the grocery store and make choices that are aligned with federal dietary guidelines \u2014 in hopes of reducing rates of diet-related chronic disease, the FDA said.",
      "Under the rule, products that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201d must contain a certain amount of food from one or more food groups such as fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein. And for the first time, the rule sets certain limits for added sugars. Foods must also limit sodium and saturated fat at levels that depend on the type of product, the FDA said.",
      "The change banishes foods such as sugary cereals, highly sweetened yogurts, white bread and some granola bars from bearing a \u201chealthy\u201d label, while allowing foods such as avocados, olive oil, salmon, eggs and some trail mix to use it. Even water can now be labeled as healthy, the agency said.",
      "\u201cIt's critical for the future of the country that food be a vehicle for wellness,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement. \u201cImproving access to nutrition information is an important public health effort the FDA can undertake to help people build healthy eating patterns.\u201d",
      "The new rule will take effect within two months and food manufacturers will have until February 2028 to comply. A label that designates certain foods as healthy is still being developed, FDA officials said. Under the previous rule, about 15% of products were eligible for the healthy designation, but only 5% made the claim.",
      "First proposed in 2022, the change is a much-needed update to \u201chorribly outdated\u201d guidance, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.",
      "\u201cBig picture, this is a huge improvement from a 30-year-old outdated definition based on 40-year-old science,\u201d he said.",
      "The new rule acknowledges that dietary and nutrition knowledge has progressed over three decades and that the previous definition didn\u2019t jibe with dietary guidelines that are the cornerstone of federal programs and policies.",
      "Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group, said that the new rule \u201cstands to exclude some packaged foods, despite countless years of industry innovation to provider healthier options.\u201d",
      "Sarah Gallo, an official for the group, said it is concerned the new rule \u201cis not based on clear and unambiguous scientific evidence\u201d and doesn't fully consider the full potential economic impact on consumers.",
      "The updated criteria are based on data that could improve public health, including diet-related chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes, the FDA said.",
      "More than three-quarters of Americans have diets low in vegetables, fruit and dairy, according to the FDA. Nearly 80% exceed limits on saturated fat, more than 60% exceed limits on added sugars and about 90% exceed limits on sodium that can reduce chronic disease.",

      "In their lawsuit, the three men said they weren\u2019t responsible for any body odor, weren\u2019t seated near each other and didn\u2019t know each other before the incident. American offered to rebook them, but when it became clear after about an hour that there were no other available flights to New York that evening, they were allowed to reboard the plane.",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's ambitious reality show, which the YouTube megastar hopes will expand his giant online reach and turn the corner on recent controversies, is already raising questions from consumer advocates over a partnership with a fintech company.",
      "Prime Video's Thursday premiere of the record-setting \u201cBeast Games\" capped off a tumultuous year for Jimmy Donaldson and his production company. Shortly after reaching never-before-seen YouTube subscriber totals, MrBeast began facing heightened scrutiny over past \u201cinappropriate content,\u201d the channel's philanthropic efforts, its workplace culture and allegations of dangerous on-set conditions that Donaldson has denied.",
      "As MrBeast's loyal following tunes in to watch 1,000 contestants compete for $5 million on \u201cBeast Games,\" they are invited to scan a QR code during the show for a shot at winning their own life-changing money. It's a $4.2 million sweepstakes run by fintech company MoneyLion, an app that sends cash advances \u2014 often for a fee to workers living paycheck to paycheck.",
      "The collaboration is billed as a way for MrBeast, who has sought to regain brand trust in recent interviews with alternative media personalities, to give back to his fanbase while presenting them with MoneyLion's personal finance tools. But consumer advocates warn MoneyLion's early payments \u2014 which are also promoted to giveaway entrants \u2014 operate as payday loans that could trap needy users in earnings-depleting borrowing cycles with additional fees.",
      "Watchdogs find that those services are not recommendable for younger audiences, making it an unusual partner for MrBeast to introduce to his persuadable fandom.",
      "\u201cThese types of high-cost, fintech payday loans, wrapped up in fancy apps, just put people in a debt trap where they have to borrow this week\u2019s pay to pay last week\u2019s loan and sets them back in their financial goals,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, a director at the National Consumer Law Center who specializes in small dollar lending.",
      "\u201cBeast Games\u201d marks Donaldson\u2019s crossover into television entertainment. The North Carolina native has already captured online attention spans with his highly-produced, fast-paced YouTube videos that often feature absurd stunts and massive cash sums; \"Beat Ronaldo, Win $1,000,000\u201d recently pit professional athletes against amateurs in their respective sports.",
      "He's now testing the broad appeal of those viral spectacles with a competition series that promises \u201cnail-biting, physical, mental, and social challenges\u201d similar to Netflix's fictional survival drama \u201cSquid Game.\" The $5 million prize is believed to be the largest in reality television history and Donaldson posted recently that he spent $14 million alone \u201cbuilding a city in a field\u201d for the contestants.",
      "MoneyLion's partnership will bring \u201cfans closer to the action than ever before,\u201d according to a company press release. Over 1,000 prizes will be awarded to MoneyLion accountholders across eight drawings over the next year. Additional entries can be earned through daily log-ins on the MoneyLion app, where users are promised exclusive, behind-the-scenes content from the series. Consistent with sweepstakes law, participants must be legal U.S. residents ages 18 or older.",
      "Upon entering the giveaway, a popup asks, \u201cWant more ways to get money?\u201d with an invitation to borrow money through MoneyLion's loan services. Consumer watchdogs say cash advancements can come with steep costs despite casting themselves as \u201cno interest\" loans.",
      "Users must pay a sliding \u201cturbo\u201d fee to get their \u201cInstacash\u201d advancements \u201cwithin minutes\" instead of waiting the 2-5 days that MoneyLion estimates it would otherwise take to hit an external checking account. The company charges $8.99 for the maximum advance of $100.",
      "That makes MoneyLion one of the \u201cmore expensive options in this market,\u201d according to Center for Responsible Lending Senior Policy Counsel Andrew Kushner. Considering the products are geared toward cash-strapped people who need money now, Kushner said most users end up paying the fees.",
      "These apps create a \u201ccycle of borrowing\u201d as financially vulnerable users try to keep up with the \u201cextremely high cost of the loan relative to the size,\u201d according to Kushner. The Center for Responsible Lending found that users of these apps experienced a 56% increase in checking account overdrafts. Borrowers who use these \u201cearned wage access\" services withdrew 36 times a year, according to a 2021 California Department of Financial Protection report.",
      "A 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau lawsuit alleges that MoneyLion misled users to believe they could easily end monthly memberships necessary to access some installment loans but then refused to cancel those with outstanding loans.",
      "A representative for MrBeast declined to comment. In an emailed statement, a MoneyLion spokesperson said the company pairs financial tools and products to support \u201clong-term financial health and stability\u201d \u2014 all of which will be promoted to Beast Games Giveaway participants. MoneyLion said it will \u201ccontinue to collaborate with regulatory bodies\u201d including CFPB, according to the spokesperson, and focus on ensuring its products are \u201caccessible, fair, and designed to create the best outcomes for our customers.\u201d",
      "Its \u201cInstacash\u201d fees are \u201cclearly disclosed,\u201d the spokesperson wrote, and the service helps workers \u201cbreak the traditional payroll cycle\u201d to \u201cmeet unexpected financial obligations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Beast Games Giveaway is designed exclusively for an 18+ audience and represents a groundbreaking way to combine engaging content with accessible financial education,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThrough this collaboration, participants gain exposure to MoneyLion\u2019s diverse marketplace of financial products, tools, and content.\u201d",
      "Saunders, the consumer protection lawyer, said some lenders provide financial wellness tools that are really just \u201csugarcoating\u201d their high-cost loans.",
      "It's \u201cconcerning,\u201d according to Kushner, to advertise such a service toward younger adults who are still developing their sense of financial responsibility and are more susceptible to \u201cthe slick marketing of this industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can see at 18 (years old) how that could be a really exciting thing to have in front of you,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cBut it can really have negative consequences once you go down the pathway of using it.\u201d",

      "Nearly 3 million people could receive a boost in Social Security payments under legislation that's set for a final vote in the Senate",
      "ATLANTA -- Nearly 3 million people could receive a boost in Social Security payments under legislation set for a final Senate vote in the coming days.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would end longtime provisions that reduce the federal benefit for people who are also eligible for other pensions. The policies have heavily affected people who worked in state, local and federal government jobs, as well as teachers, firefighters and police officers, according to lawmakers and advocates.",
      "The bill has bipartisan support but has drawn some criticism from some conservatives. The House approved the measure in November by a vote of 327-75 and the bill easily cleared its first hurdle in the Senate on Wednesday. Its backers hope the Senate will vote to send the legislation to President Joe Biden before lawmakers\u2019 lame-duck session gives way to the new Congress in January.",
      "Here is more on what the bill would mean:",
      "The bill would repeal two provisions that limit Social Security benefits for certain recipients based on retirement payments they get from other sources \u2014 most often, but not exclusively, a public retirement program of a state or local government.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision modifies the usual benefit formula for retirees or disabled workers who are entitled to pension payments based on earnings from jobs that were not covered by Social Security.",
      "The details vary person to person but the idea, broadly, is that a monthly benefit is reduced by an amount tied to how much that person is receiving from a pension program in which they enrolled in lieu of paying Social Security payroll taxes.",
      "The Government Pension Offset follows a similar principle. It limits Social Security spousal benefits (those paid to a spouse based on their living spouse\u2019s work and payroll tax history) and the widow\u2019s or widower\u2019s benefits (paid after a spouse\u2019s death). Reductions are based on pension benefits for a retired federal, state or local government worker who opted out of some or all Social Security taxes and instead paid into another public retirement insurance program.",
      "Current law establishes the offset at two-thirds of an alternative pension payment.",
      "Under that standard, for example, a retired public health nurse might receive a $1,500 monthly disbursement from a state retirement system that does not participate in Social Security. Then, if that person becomes eligible to receive a spouse's Social Security benefit after the spouse's death, that survivor's Social Security benefit would be reduced by $1,000 each month.",
      "Social Security is commonly understood as a universal system in which everyone participates by paying Social Security payroll taxes and later getting benefits. But federal law has carved out exceptions. Generally, there are a few job categories that can be exempted and, thus, trigger benefit offsets:",
      "\u2014 Civilian federal employees hired before 1984 are covered under the Civil Service Retirement System instead of Social Security. Federal workers hired since 1984 are covered under a different federal retirement structure that requires those employees participate in Social Security.",
      "\u2014 State and local government employees who participate in their jurisdictions\u2019 retirement systems that allow them to opt out of Social Security.",
      "\u2014 Railroad workers who are covered under a separate federal insurance program.",
      "\u2014 Some clergy who can opt out.",
      "The Congressional Research Service estimates that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.",
      "The largest category of existing workers whose future benefits could be affected are the state and local government employees.",
      "There are additional people still in the workforce whose future benefits would be affected. CRS estimated that in 2022, about 6.6 million, or 28% of the nation\u2019s state and local government workers, were not covered in the Social Security system. So as those people retire they could become eligible to get money from Social Security that they would not receive without the changes.",
      "The current proposal calls for changes to payments for January 2024 and beyond. If Congress sticks to that timeline, that means the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025.",
      "The CBO estimates that ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "All those amounts would increase over time with Social Security\u2019s regular cost-of-living adjustments.",
      "For the Social Security program, the expected net spending increase from 2024-34 is about $198 billion. Separately, the changes would yield an estimated $2 billion in savings for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program because those food aid payments would be reduced for some households whose Social Security income increases.",
      "That would mean added fiscal strain on the Social Security Trust funds, which already were estimated to be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The cost was a reason some House conservatives tried to block the bill. Supporters acknowledged the fiscal impact but said it was a matter of fairness.",
      "It depends.",
      "The proposals moving on Capitol Hill are straightforward: \u201cThe Commissioner of Social Security shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account\u201d changes in the law. And the Social Security Administration, through income tax filings, has everyone\u2019s earnings history used to calculate monthly benefit payments under the laws and formulas that Congress sets.",
      "But it's not immediately clear how easily the Social Security Administration could adjust payments for a few million people \u2014 whether it could be managed mostly by automated systems recalculating or whether it would require federal employees individually reviewing individual cases with beneficiaries.",
      "Additionally, the proposed changes to the spousal benefits could create newly eligible beneficiaries who are not currently getting such payments and could have to apply specifically for the benefit. The CBO estimates about 70,000 new beneficiaries by the end of 2033.",
      "Also, recipients with complicated formulas \u2013 including those that change as Congress tinkers with the law \u2013 can sometimes see errors in their payments when they have been automatically recalculated. Backdated payments can be especially problematic.",
      "The Social Security Administration has extensive Q&As and recipient services on its website: ssa.gov. For example, one can calculate how their additional pensions can affect their benefits under current law using this tool. But the agency has not yet addressed the pending legislation publicly.",
      "The agency also operates a toll-free hotline \u2014 1-800-772-1213 \u2014 and will schedule in-person meetings at one of hundreds of Social Security offices around the country.",
      "The Social Security Administration has a diminished staff after Congress has for years declined to fund the agency at its requested levels, even as the baby boomer generation ages and adds to the workload. Complex changes from Congress could create or exacerbate backlogs for recipients trying to get the precise benefits required under the law."

      "WASHINGTON -- A government shutdown at risk, House Speaker Mike Johnson is fighting to figure out how to meet President-elect Donald Trump's sudden demands \u2014 and keep his own job \u2014 while federal offices are being told to prepare to shutter operations ahead of Friday's midnight deadline.",
      "Trump said early Thursday that Johnson will \u201ceasily remain speaker\u201d for the next Congress if he \u201cacts decisively and tough\u201d in coming up with a new plan to also increase the debt limit, a stunning request just before the Christmas holidays that has put the beleaguered speaker in a bind.",
      "And if not, the president-elect warned of trouble ahead for Johnson and Republicans in Congress.",
      "\u201cAnybody that supports a bill that doesn\u2019t take care of the Democrat quicksand known as the debt ceiling should be primaried and disposed of as quickly as possible,\u201d Trump told Fox News Digital.",
      "The chaotic turn of events, coming days before Friday's midnight deadline to fund the government and as lawmakers were preparing to head home for the holidays, sparks a familiar reminder of what it's like in Trump-run Washington. Trump led Republicans into the longest government shutdown in history during the 2018 Christmas season, and interrupted the holidays in 2020 by tanking a bipartisan Covid-relief bill and forcing a do-over.",
      "For Johnson, who faces his own problems ahead of a Jan. 3 House vote to remain speaker, Trump's demands kept him working long into the night to broker a new deal. Vice President-elect JD Vance joined the late-night meetings at the Capitol, bringing his young son in pajamas.",
      "Trump\u2019s allies even floated the far-fetched idea of giving billionaire Elon Musk the speaker\u2019s gavel, since the speaker is not required to be a member of the Congress.",

    "story": [
      "An Australian computer scientist who falsely claimed to be the founder of the bitcoin cryptocurrency has been found to have committed contempt of court by breaching an order of London\u2019s High Court",
      "LONDON -- An Australian computer scientist who falsely claimed to be the founder of the bitcoin cryptocurrency was found Thursday to be in contempt of an order of London's High Court.",
      "In a judgment on Thursday, Justice James Mellor said Craig Wright had committed \u201ca clear breach\" of the order in March that barred him from launching or threatening further legal action related to bitcoin, which has seen a meteoric rise in value since its launch around the time of the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Lawyers for the Crypto Open Patent Alliance, or Copa, a group of technology and cryptocurrency firms, told the court on Wednesday that Wright had issued a claim worth more than 900 billion pounds ($1.1 trillion) related to intellectual property rights connected to bitcoin in October. They argued that constituted contempt of court and that he should be jailed.",
      "Mellor said it was \u201cbeyond any reasonable doubt\u201d that Wright had indeed been in contempt of the court order. The judge was expected to sentence Wright later Thursday.",
      "Wright, who according to court documents is in either Indonesia or Singapore, attended Thursday's hearing by video link. He did not attend the previous day's session when Copa made its case.",
      "He said he planned to appeal the contempt finding.",
      "In March, the judge ruled that Wright was not, as he claimed, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, nor the author of the initial versions of the bitcoin software.",
      "For eight years, Wright had claimed that he was the man behind \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto,\u201d the pseudonym that masked the identity of the creator of bitcoin.",
      "The murky origins of bitcoin date to the height of the financial crisis in 2008. A paper authored by a person or group using the Nakamoto pen name explained how digital currency could be sent around the world anonymously, without banks or national currencies. Nakamoto seemed to vanish three years later and their identity was never established.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, XRP, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but most daily financial transactions are still conducted using currencies such as the dollar.",
      "Wright, who first claimed he was Nakamoto in 2016, has been accused of seeking to profit from bitcoin's huge spike in value. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, for example, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Earlier this month in the wake of the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump, who is a big supporter of cryptocurrencies, it breached the $100,000 level for the first time.",
      "The currency remains hugely volatile. On Thursday, it was trading at around $80,000, down nearly a fifth in just a couple of weeks."

      "Smith has been with the company since 2007 and was named chief operating officer last year.",
      "On Thursday, investors were caught off guard by a whopping $36 million loss in the fiscal second-quarter. The company last year posted profits of $215 million during the same period. Even stripping out one-time costs, the company missed Wall Street projections for per-share earnings of $1.02 by 36 cents.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a question that\u2019s been going through my head a lot over the last week,\u201d said Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach. \u201cShe\u2019s not far away.\u201d",
      "Vonn is slated to race super-Gs on Saturday and Sunday in St. Moritz.",
      "While Vonn has won a record 28 World Cup super-Gs, including three at the Swiss resort, calculating her current potential is not an exact science.",
      "During two lower-level FIS super-G races in Copper Mountain, Colorado, two weeks ago, she finished 24th and 19th. Although not too much should be read into those results, because Vonn\u2019s main goal was just completing the race with a half-decent time to gain the necessary qualifying points to return to the World Cup \u2014 which she accomplished.",
      "A better guide might be last weekend\u2019s World Cup races in Beaver Creek, Colorado, when Vonn was the final forerunner testing the course.",
      "Knight said that Vonn\u2019s forerunning times were 1.2 seconds behind downhill winner Cornelia Huetter and 1.4 behind super-G winner Sofia Goggia \u2014 which would have placed her about 12th in both races.",
      "But Vonn said she wasn\u2019t going 100% during her forerunning duties.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s still got a lot left. She can push a lot harder,\u201d Knight told The Associated Press as he arrived in St. Moritz. \u201cOnce she gets in the start gate with the bib on, she\u2019s going to go obviously as hard as she can.\u201d",
      "Under a new wild card rule for former champions, Vonn will start after the top 30 ranked racers complete their runs \u2014 likely with No. 31 or No. 32.",
      "The Engiadina course in St. Moritz is entirely above the tree line, which makes it susceptible to strong and sudden gusts of wind.",
      "\u201cMaybe starting No. 31 won\u2019t be so bad with those long flats at the top, to get some of that fresh snow off the track. Speed it up a little bit,\u201d Knight said.",
      "Sun is forecast for Saturday, with overcast conditions and possibly some snow on Sunday.",
      "By the time Vonn comes down, Goggia, Olympic champion Lara Gut-Behrami and the other top racers will have already come down.",
      "Mikaela Shiffrin, who shares the record of five wins in St. Moritz across all disciplines with Vonn, isn\u2019t racing this weekend as she recovers from abdominal surgery to clean out a puncture wound she sustained in a crash last month.",
      "Vonn left the tour with 82 World Cup wins \u2014 the record for a woman at the time and within reach of the then all-time Alpine mark of 86 held by Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark. The women\u2019s record held by Vonn was eclipsed in January 2023 by Shiffrin, who now has an outright record 99 wins.",
      "Vonn\u2019s last big race was the downhill at the world championships in Are, Sweden, in February 2019 when she won bronze on her damaged legs, which had been worn down by a series of crashes and injuries that forced her to retire.",
      "But she underwent replacement surgery on her right knee in April and is feeling better physically now than she has in years.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s in way, way better balance than she was back then,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThis knee is in incredible shape now. She has no swelling, no pain. And for the first three camps \u2014 July, September and November, I never saw out of balance once, which is pretty impressive.\u201d",
      "Knight, who also coached Vonn within the U.S. Ski Team during various phases of her earlier career, first heard rumblings about her return a year ago. Then in May as Vonn was healing from the surgery, they drew out a comeback plan with Knight in his new role as a Red Bull coach. She first hit the snow on the glacier in Soelden, Austria, in July. Then they went to New Zealand, back to Soelden and ultimately finished the prep period in Colorado.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a better skier right now. A better balanced skier than I remember at the end of her last season,\u201d Knight said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it when you start watching.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe boots are new \u2014 it\u2019s a completely different model,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThose things are the fine details that you need to have dialed in to really be at the top of ski racing. Fundamentally I\u2019m in a great place, and now it\u2019s just fine tuning to be able to be truly competitive.\u201d",
      "Vonn\u2019s longtime ski technician Heinz Haemmerle retired, so her equipment supplier Head assigned her Chris Krause, who formerly worked for Didier Cuche and Bode Miller.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very, very particular with the equipment,\u201d Knight said. \u201cAnd Lindsey really likes that.\u201d",

      "The Nittany Lions (34-2) had to get off the mat for their 11th consecutive win after dropping the first two sets 25-23 and 25-18 in their first Final Four since 2017. They climbed back to win the next two 25-23 and 28-26 \u2014 fighting off several match points in the fourth \u2014 and force a fifth set against their Big Ten rivals. They gutted out a 15-13 victory before a mostly red-clad crowd of 21,726, a semifinal attendance record.",
      "\u201cI thought we were making one too many errors and we didn't look too confident,\u201d Schumacher-Cawley said. \"We came out after that and focused on our serve, our serve-pass game got better and we found ways to score defensively. ...

      "Harper Murray had 20 kills and Andi Jackson 19 for Nebraska (33-3), which sought to return to the championship after last year's runner-up finish to Texas. The Cornhuskers had won five in a row since losing 3-1 to Penn State three weeks ago in the lone regular-season meeting. Three sweeps highlighted the streak, including 3-0 over Wisconsin in the regional final. The Huskers sought their first title since winning in 2017.",
      "\u201cI thought we put 'em away in game four and they found a way to win that game and carry a lot of momentum into game five,\" Nebraska coach John Cook said. \"Tremendous performance by Jess. She hit some shots we had no answer for.\u201d",

      "Kirk Cousins didn\u2019t forget how to play quarterback. He just didn\u2019t do it well enough often enough to keep his job in Atlanta.",
      "Don\u2019t write off the veteran just yet.",
      "There\u2019s no sugarcoating the way Cousins played over the past five games. He struggled mightily, throwing just one touchdown pass and nine interceptions in that span.",
      "But this was the same guy who had 117.2 passer rating and led the Falcons to a comeback win on the final drive in Week 2 in Philadelphia in just his second start coming back from surgery for a torn Achilles tendon.",
      "Cousins threw for 509 yards and four touchdowns against the Buccaneers on Oct. 3. He had four TD passes and a 145.9 passer rating in another win over Tampa Bay on Oct. 27. He followed that up with three TD passes and a 144.8 rating in a victory against Dallas a week later on Nov. 3.",
      "Then came a terrible stretch. That prompted Falcons coach Raheem Morris to make the bold decision to bench Cousins for rookie Michael Penix Jr. in the middle of a playoff chase.",
      "The Falcons lost four straight games, including three in a row against teams with tough defenses \u2014 Broncos, Chargers, Vikings \u2014 before beating the Raiders. Cousins only threw 17 passes, completing 11 for 112 yards, one TD and one interception in a 15-9 win in Las Vegas.",
      "That wasn\u2019t good enough to keep him in the lineup.",
      "Penix, the eighth overall pick in the NFL draft, gets a soft landing for his first career start. The Falcons (7-7) host the woeful New York Giants (2-12) on Sunday. Atlanta could win that game giving the ball to Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier 50 times.",
      "Cousins will watch from the sideline as an expensive backup. The Falcons gave the four-time Pro Bowl QB a $180 million, four-year contract on the first day of free agency. Cousins got $100 million guaranteed with $27.5 million of that money still owed to him.",
      "His contract, which includes a no-trade clause, complicates a pending divorce from Atlanta. Of course, Cousins is also just one play away from going back under center if Penix gets hurt.",
      "If Penix stays healthy, this still isn\u2019t the end for Cousins.",
      "Just two weeks ago, Morris was heaping praising on him.",
      "\u201cThat guy has carried us,\u201d Morris said after Cousins threw four picks in a loss to the Chargers on Dec. 1. \u201cThat guy has got us to the point where we\u2019re 6-6 and we\u2019re first place in the division. Still got everything in front of us, despite what happened today. It\u2019s up to us to bounce back and find a way to win football games, and there\u2019s no better man than (No.) 18 to go do that for us.\u201d",
      "Cousins turns 37 before the start of the 2025 season. He should still have plenty of football left in his right arm. He could veto any trade and force Atlanta to release him. If the Falcons designate Cousins a post-June 1 release, they would incur a dead-cap hit of $40 million. The Broncos took on a $49.5 million hit this season by releasing Russell Wilson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pro football. There\u2019s a standard that I have for myself, that the team has for me,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t playing up to that standard consistently enough. It is what it is. You roll with it. Now, you still get ready, one play away kind of a thing, and support Mike and just try to help our team be able to find a way to win these last three to get in the playoffs. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. That\u2019s my focus.\u201d",
      "Several teams will enter the offseason looking for a new starting quarterback, including the Giants, Titans and Raiders. The Jets and Browns, also could be in the mix.",
      "Cousins isn\u2019t at a point where he should accept a backup job. There are too many mediocre quarterbacks across the league.",

      "Muhleman died on Saturday in Charlotte peacefully after battling some heart-related issues, his son Lee Patterson told The Associated Press.",
      "Muhleman worked closely with Panthers founder Jerry Richardson in his quest to bring an NFL franchise to the Carolinas in the early 1990s. Muhleman delivered the closing marketing pitch at the October 1993 owners\u2019 meetings for Richardson, who would ultimately be unanimously awarded the league\u2019s 29th franchise.",
      "The Panthers began playing in 1995.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people realize what a big role Max played in getting the expansion team,\" said former Panthers director of communications Charlie Dayton. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t out front, he preferred to be in the background. That was him. But he was as valuable as anybody in the process of getting a team. He was there every step of the way.\u201d",
      "Muhleman's marketing plan for the Panthers included landing three NFL preseason games in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and another in Columbia, South Carolina.",
      "All three games sold out, helping prove to league owners that the Carolinas were a viable market.",
      "Still, there was the matter of funding the expansion team.",
      "Richardson didn't want to use taxpayer money and the league was worried at the time about him taking on any additional debt.",
      "That is when Muhleman invented the concept of the PSL, where fans could pay a one-time fee for the annual right to buy season tickets. The Panthers sold more than 55,000 PSLs and the millions raised from that venture were used to build the 72,000-seat Bank of America Stadium in downtown Charlotte.",

      "\u201cHe had some really cool \u2018firsts\u2019 in sports,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe idea of the PSL almost came out of desperation at the time. It was like a Hail Mary. And it worked.\"",
      "Several other professional sports franchises have since adopted the idea of PSLs as a means of funding private stadiums and arenas.",
      "The Panthers still use PSLs.",
      "Earlier in his career, Muhleman worked alongside then-Hornets owner George Shinn to develop the strategy and pitch that would help Charlotte land an NBA expansion team in 1988.",
      "He also advised Rick Hendrick when he was looking into becoming a NASCAR team owner.",
      "Patterson said his father's greatest quality might have been his ability to develop and maintain personal relationships.",
      "\u201cHe loved sports,\" Patterson said. \u201cWhat he was able to do, because of his background as a top-notch sports journalist, was make people he spoke to feel important and liked. He made them feel that they wanted to do business with him. It was the cultivation of not just clients, but friends. And he went on to sustain relationships with all of his clients.\u201d ___",

      "He also has memories of his dad in the minors.",
      "\u201cI was the bat boy,\" Cody said. \"That was always really, really cool for me to be able to run out on the field and pick up the players' bats and shag their batting practice,\"",
      "Bellinger figures to play outfield or first base with the Yankees, who are retooling after the loss to Juan Soto to the Mets. Left-hander Max Fried was added to the starting rotation and closer Devin Williams to the bullpen.",
      "Clay Bellinger was an outfielder and infielder for the Yankees from 1999 to 2001, then finished his big league career with the Anaheim Angels in 2002. In Game 2 of the 2000 World Series, he caught Todd Zeile's drive off Mariano Rivera at the top of the left-field wall.",
      "\u201cIt is truly wild. When I got the news, I called him and he was very excited,\" Cody said of his dad. \"He plays it all cool. But I know deep down he\u2019s really excited.\u201d",
      "Cody won the 2019 NL MVP award with the Los Angeles Dodgers after hitting .305 with 47 homers, 115 RBIs and a 1.035 OPS.",
      "He followed with three straight subpar seasons, missing time in 2021 because of calf, hamstring and rib injuries. He was cut after the 2022 season and signed a $17.5 million, one-year deal with the Cubs.",
      "Bellinger hit a career-high .307 with 29 homers and 97 RBIs, became a free agent again and in late February signed an $80 million, three-year contract with the Cubs that allowed him to opt out after 2024 and 25.",
      "He hit .266 with 18 homers and 78 RBIs in 130 games this year, missing time because of a broken right rib. The Cubs traded the 29-year-old with $52.5 million remaining on the contract and agreed to pay the Yankees $5 million.",
      "If the Yankees acquire a first baseman, they could align Bellinger in center with Aaron Judge in right and Jasson Dom\u00ednguez in left or put Dom\u00ednguez in center and Bellinger in left.",
      "Bellinger learned how to stay sharp at multiple positions from former Dodgers teammate Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez and told manager Aaron Boone he's flexible.",
      "\u201cI told him that wherever y\u2019all need me to play, I\u2019ll play, whether it\u2019s left, center. If Judge gets a DH day, I\u2019ll play right, or if you need me at first base, I\u2019ll play first,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy doing that stuff. I think that it helps the teams that I\u2019m on win.\u201d",
      "A left-handed hitter, Bellinger could benefit from Yankee Stadium's short porch. New York has 87 games with those dimensions because the Tampa Bay Rays will be playing home games at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees' spring training site.",
      "Bellinger has played just three games in the Bronx, going 3 for 10 with a home run off Carlos Rod\u00f3n in July 2023 that landed in the right field second deck.",
      "\u201cIt definitely excites me,\u201d he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:22:25 -0500",
    "summary": "It took more than 100 years, a few billion dollars and the cold, hard realization that you can&rsquo;t fight progress forever",
    "story": [
      "It took more than 100 years, a few billion dollars and the cold, hard realization that you can\u2019t fight progress forever",
      "It took more than 100 years, a few billion dollars and the cold, hard realization that you can\u2019t fight progress forever. And now, finally, college football has what the rest of sports have \u2014 a legitimate postseason tournament.",
      "The first 12-team College Football Playoff kicks off Friday and Saturday with four first-round games on campuses steeped in gridiron tradition: Texas (hosting Clemson), Penn State (SMU), Notre Dame (Indiana) and Ohio State (Tennessee).",
      "The winners advance to play over the New Year's holiday \u2014 Arizona State, Boise State, Georgia and Oregon are waiting \u2014 and the tournament concludes Jan. 20 with the national title game in Atlanta.",
      "The concept of a postseason tournament is old hat for virtually every other major sport in the United States (including the lower levels of college football), but this postseason is a novel one for the top level of the game. Not surprisingly for an endeavor that took a century to create, it is teeming with prickly details that will ultimately shape the future of the playoff itself.",
      "A deal struck decades ago as part of the NFL's anti-trust exemption deems Saturdays as college territory, prohibiting the league from televising games on college football's biggest day. But that ban is only in effect through mid-December, which is when the NFL jumps in.",
      "On Saturday, it has a pair of standout games: Texans-Chiefs on NBC and Steelers-Ravens on Fox. The CFP has chosen to counterprogram those games with SMU-Penn State and Clemson-Texas, both of which were sublicensed to TNT as part of ESPN's original deal to broadcast the playoff.",
      "How will this go? College football's most-watched game this season grabbed 16.6 million viewers, while last year's title game, when the playoff only consisted of four teams, drew 25 million.",
      "A regular-season NFL game between the Bills and Rams earlier this month drew 24 million viewers and the NFL averaged around 38.5 million viewers for its first round of playoff games last season.",
      "Does it matter? ESPN is signed to the deal (topping out at $1.3 billion a year) through 2031, though if the ratings tank, it might be compelled to look for friendlier TV windows and avoid the ratings behemoth that is the NFL.",
      "\u201cI think it's important for them to get a reasonable rating,\u201d said Dan Durbin, the director of the Institute of Sports, Media and Society at USC. \u201cI don't think beating the NFL really even counts.\u201d",
      "We can trace it back to the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Organizers of the annual parade wanted a way to pay for all those flower-covered floats cruising down Colorado Boulevard.",
      "In 1902, they invited Michigan and Stanford to play (the Wolverines won 49-0). In 1916, it was Washington State and Brown, and from there, the game became an annual affair.",
      "Other cities followed suit, mostly in warm-weather areas. By 1937, the Rose, Orange (Miami), Sugar (New Orleans) and Cotton (Dallas) were annual bowls, By the 1940s and '50s, the games had contractual tie-ins with conferences, which pledged to send their teams there.",
      "The games entrenched themselves in the local tourism economy and, so, also became dug into the fabric of college football itself. While virtually all sports had moved toward some sort of playoff tournament by the 1960s, college football stood pat and the bowl games served as its postseason.",
      "The Associated Press started its poll of sports writers in 1936 and began awarding its national championship to whoever was ranked first at the end of each season. In 1968, the AP moved its final poll to after the bowls were over.",
      "Other polls followed \u2014 more than 20 different systems or rankings have come and gone since the late 1800s \u2014 and for decades, those organizations crowned national champions. They often differed, including 11 seasons where AP and the coaches/UPI polls declared different champions.",
      "Because the bowl games were locked into inviting teams from certain conferences, the top two teams in the sport often never played each other.",
      "\u201cIn college football, you had so many teams, so many conferences that it\u2019s just been unwieldy to try to create a real postseason,\u201d Durbin said.",
      "That remains true to this day, even with the expanded playoffs.",
      "The seeds of change were planted after back-to-back seasons with split titles in 1990 and 1991 made it clear something needed to be done. Over the ensuing 35 years, a cocktail of conference realignment, ever-growing TV contracts and, most recently, the financial realities of a sport that will soon share millions with its players spawned new ways for the sport to tackle its playoff problem.",
      "In the 1990s, a two-decade period of systems \u2014 the Bowl Alliance, Bowl Coalition and Bowl Championship Series \u2014 tried to pair the two best teams in the country to play for the title. Rankings were based on a combination of polls, computer rankings and strength of schedule \u2014 a formula that has been tweaked many times but remains a sore spot to this day.",
      "The BCS turned into the College Football Playoff in 2014 with a four-team postseason that felt like progress.",
      "One problem was that the gap grew even wider between what mattered and what didn't \u2014 three playoff games vs. dozens of bowl games that looked more and more like exhibitions, especially if players with NFL prospects opted out.",
      "Another was the selection process. The March Madness selection committee in college basketball isn't truly in jeopardy of sidelining the eventual national champion if it makes a bad choice for, say, the last two teams in a 68-team field.",
      "Not so in football, where the field is smaller, every game means more and the financial stakes are higher. The SEC and Big Ten, for instance, receive around $22 million in playoff TV money before a single game is played. There is a pool of about $115 million available to the conferences based on the results of the playoff.",
      "Last year, when the football committee chose one-loss Alabama over undefeated Florida State for the fourth and final spot, it triggered investigations and threats.",
      "The road to 12 teams was already paved by then, but it has been equally as fraught. Some reveled in the fact that the first team out of the bracket this time was the very Alabama program that was chosen a year earlier.",
      "There is also the issue of automatic bids that go to conference winners, which have not only put Boise State and Arizona State (teams ranked eighth and 10th in the latest AP Top 25) into the tournament but given them two of the four first-round byes.",
      "There is the issue of travel \u2014 how many fans can afford to go to three neutral-site games to watch their team chase a championship? With scant time to prepare, can the schools and the CFP pull off campus games without a hitch? Oh, what about the lack of students on campus this week?",
      "The eventual champion will also end up playing 16, maybe 17, games, carving into classroom time that's supposed to still mean something at the college level.",
      "Within a year or two, this tournament will likely expand to 14 teams. The issue of \u201caccess\u201d \u2014 which conferences get in and how many teams they are allowed \u2014 will top that debate. There is also growing separation between the SEC and Big Ten and the rest of college football that makes many in the sport uneasy.",
      "Before all that, it's time to buckle up. College football's first wild ride through the playoffs will last a full month.",

      "Sebastian Coe, the World Athletics president who turned 68 this year, pledged to embed \u201ctransformative change over the next four years\u201d then seek re-election ahead of schedule.",
      "Coe was among several candidates offering to give back to IOC members \u2014 who elect their president at a March 18-21 meeting near the site of Ancient Olympia in Greece \u2014 a decisive choice in picking future host cities.",
      "Under the hands-on presidency of Thomas Bach, who reaches his limit of 12 years in office next year, members now simply rubber-stamp a single host candidate that has worked with the IOC administration.",
      "Two members of the Bach-chaired IOC executive board, Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. and Prince Feisal al Hussein, joined Coe in promising to empower members to have a bigger role in the Olympic body. They also promise to raise the retirement age for members from 70 to 75 years.",
      "Members must be invited to join the exclusive IOC club and the current 111 include European and Middle East royalty, leaders of international sports bodies, former and current Olympic athletes, politicians, diplomats, industrialists and an Oscar-winning actress.",

      "Though not specifying prize money, Prince Feisal called for Olympic athletes to be \u201cproperly valued\u201d while Samaranch proposed letting athletes use footage of their performances on social media channels. That would relax strict IOC rules on Olympic athletes\u2019 ability to promote themselves.",

      "The next IOC president also must address the impact of climate change on the global sports calendar, gender issues in sports, when and how to bring Russia back fully into the Olympic Games and signing a new U.S. broadcast deal. Long-time partner NBC\u2019s deal expires after the 2032 Brisbane Olympics and has been a foundation of Olympic revenue, which was $7.6 billion in the 2021-24 Olympic cycle.",

      "\u201cDespite a challenging geopolitical backdrop, a significant amount has been achieved over the last couple of years including the delivery of a new sporting department, the stabilization of our finances and the delivery of our iconic new stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cI now hand over to new owners confident in the outlook for the club and that our incredible fans will see the success on the pitch that they so thoroughly deserve.\u201d",
      "There may be some concern, however, among Everton fans about the Friedkins, who have never spoken publicly in the four years since they purchased Roma and are unpopular with supporters after making contentious management changes \u2014 including firing Daniele De Rossi, the club\u2019s beloved former captain, early this season.",
      "The Friedkin Group reached an agreement in principle in June to buy Moshiri's stake, but talks were called off a month later. Everton was then in negotiations with American businessman John Textor, who said he had an exclusivity agreement with the club but needed to first sell his stake in Premier League rival Crystal Palace.",
      "Earlier, a proposed takeover of Everton by 777 Partners collapsed amid worries about the financial stability of the company.",
      "\u201cWe understand the club has faced significant challenges on and off the pitch for several years,\u201d said Marc Watts, the new executive chairman. \u201cThat\u2019s why our immediate priority is stabilizing the club and improving results on the pitch.\u201d",
      "Watts said the group has provided an undisclosed injection of capital to ensure the completion of the new stadium, converting most of Everton\u2019s debt either to equity \u201crepaid or refinanced on terms more favorable to the stability of the club.\u201d",
      "The new owners said they had six goals, including \u201cstrengthening the men\u2019s first-team squad through thoughtful and strategic investment\u201d and \u201cenhancing Everton\u2019s reputation as a unique and historical name in world football.\u201d",

      "Formula 1 team Red Bull says Liam Lawson will be the partner for world champion Max Verstappen in 2025",
      "MILTON KEYNES, England -- Liam Lawson will partner world champion Max Verstappen at Red Bull in 2025, the Formula 1 team said on Thursday.",
      "Lawson, a New Zealander, replaces Sergio Perez, who was dropped on Wednesday after months of poor results.",
      "The 22-year-old Lawson will switch from Racing Bulls, Red Bull's sister team, after racing as a replacement driver in 2023 and this year. He started in Red Bull's junior program.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that racing alongside Max, a four-time champion and undoubtedly one of the greatest drivers ever seen in F1, is a daunting task,\u201d Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said, \"but I\u2019m sure Liam can rise to that challenge and deliver some outstanding results for us next year.\u201d",
      "Lawson said it was a \u201clifelong dream\u201d to be racing with Red Bull.",
      "\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve wanted and worked toward since I was 8 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey so far.\u201d",
      "Perez's contract was terminated two years early, the Mexican ditched after being rarely competitive this season. He had not won a race since April 2023 and the last time he finished higher than sixth in a grand prix was in May. Meanwhile, Verstappen continued to dominate F1.",
      "Lawson joined Red Bull's junior program in 2019 and made his F1 debut at the Dutch Grand Prix in 2023 with Scuderia AlphaTauri \u2014 which was later rebranded as Racing Bulls \u2014 in place of the injured Daniel Ricciardo. He completed five races for the team that year.",
      "This year, Dawson had a points-scoring finish at the United States Grand Prix, again replacing Ricciardo.",
      "\u201cLiam\u2019s performances over the course of his two stints with Racing Bulls have demonstrated that he\u2019s not only capable of delivering strong results,\u201d Horner said, \u201cbut that he\u2019s also a real racer, not afraid to mix it with the best and come out on top.\u201d",

    "summary": "Sports bettors in the U.S. are expected to set another record in 2024 for the amount of money wagered legally",
    "story": [
      "Sports bettors in the U.S. are expected to set another record in 2024 for the amount of money wagered legally",
      "In the six years since the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for states to offer sports betting, each successive year has set a record for the amount of money wagered legally.",
      "Another new high-water mark of close to $130 billion is expected by the end of 2024. It coincides with what has been a year of reckoning rocked by high-profile scandals.",
      "The bad publicity included former Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter\u2019s lifetime ban from the NBA after a league investigation found he disclosed confidential information to bettors and faked ailments in games to fix proposition bets related to his own performance. There was also the case of Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Shohei Ohtani who pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud in a case in which prosecutors said he stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball star to pay off illegal gambling debts.",
      "Ohtani was cleared of any wrongdoing, but his proximity to such malfeasance heaped negative attention on baseball's biggest name.",
      "\"When you have people betting on sports, you have people trying to corrupt sports \u2014 they go hand in hand,\u201d said John Holden, an associate professor at Indiana University who conducts research on gambling and college athletics policy. \u201cSo, these were things that were going to happen. I think it\u2019s opening people\u2019s eyes that the legalization of sports betting in the U.S. wasn\u2019t going to be the exception to the problems that come with sports betting everywhere else in the world.\u201d",
      "Porter was on a two-way contract at the time of his violations, which meant he could bounce back and forth between the Raptors and their G League affiliate. His salary was $410,000, and a standard NBA contract would have been more than $2 million. In pleading guilty to federal conspiracy charges in July, Porter acknowledged wrongdoing, saying he did it \u201cto get out from under large gambling debts.\u201d",
      "\u201cCertainly, prop bets, depending on how precise they are, lend themselves to more shenanigans than other kinds of bets,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in May.",
      "In light of Porter\u2019s banishment, BetMGM Sportsbook said in October that it would not take NBA prop bets on players on two-way or 10-day contracts. It joined several others taking this action, including U.S. sportsbook giants DraftKings and FanDuel, as well as ESPN BET.",
      "Still, Andrew Brandt, the executive director of Villanova\u2019s Moorad Center for Sports Law, said it\u2019s hard to know what kind of lasting impact these scandals will have.",
      "\u201cPorter was an \u2018easy\u2019 ban as he was a low-level player that could be sent away as a message to other players,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cThe Ippei-Shohei relationship seems to be less about gambling than an issue of trust. ... We will see.\u201d",
      "The Porter and Mizuhara incidents could also have played a factor in the slim margin by which Missouri voters approved sports betting legalization in November, with 50.05% voting in favor of the ballot measure after legislation had repeatedly stalled in the state Senate. DraftKings and FanDuel spent heavily on what turned out to be a Missouri ballot initiative record $43 million campaign.",
      "Longtime industry insider Matt Para believes that, along with an oversaturation of advertising and lower than anticipated tax benefits in the 38 states that currently allow betting, has contributed to what is an ongoing moral \u201creboot\u201d surrounding the public\u2019s attitude toward the industry.",
      "\u201cI would say the public has soured on sports betting as a whole,\u201d said Para, a consultant who has more than 20 years\u2019 experience working in online gambling. \u201cI think they\u2019re upset that they can\u2019t watch sporting events with their kids without seeing gambling pop up. ... There\u2019s a cap, I think. And we\u2019ve reached that point to what the public is willing to accept.\u201d",
      "Next year isn\u2019t likely to see any additional states enter the sports betting fray. That includes potentially lucrative markets like Texas and California.",
      "In 2022, California voters defeated two rival proposals to legalize sports betting after interest groups spent roughly $450 million either promoting or opposing the measures.",
      "The Texas Legislature meets every two years and will be back in session in 2025, but so far it hasn\u2019t seemed to have an appetite for getting into sports gambling. While Texas has been a state generally opposed to all forms of gambling, the biggest barrier currently is Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who has great influence over what bills are put up for a vote. He isn\u2019t sold that the tax benefits, that he\u2019s previously said would pay for about half a day of Texas\u2019 yearly budget, are worth it.",
      "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, most states tax sports gambling at between 5% and 20%. But tax revenues have varied vastly because only 15 states collect at least 10% of every dollar wagered.",
      "Studies by the Sports Betting Alliance, a lobbying consortium made up of sportsbooks and Texas professional sports teams, as well one by an independent law firm, have estimated the state could make upwards of $250 million in tax revenue yearly from betting. But Texas spends $125 billion a year and currently has a budget surplus.",
      "The estimates also would depend on Texas setting taxes on gambling that would be among the highest in the nation, as well as wagers generating record overall gambling revenue.",
      "California, along with states like Oklahoma, also would likely have to work out some sort of revenue sharing deal with the Native American tribal entities that currently have legal gaming rights.",
      "In California\u2019s case, such a compromise seems likely at some point because of the additional revenue in a state that already garners $9 billion from its casinos. But legalization almost certainly would come through a statewide referendum, which could only come in an even-numbered year.",
      "\u201cI sort of think that of the remaining states there might be a shocker here or there that pops up one year or another,\u201d Holden said. \u201cThere are obstacles in place. So, I think this is one of these things where we aren\u2019t going to see four states happen in a year again.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A federal judge granted Diego Pavia \u2019s request for a preliminary injunction allowing the quarterback to play the 2025 season and told the NCAA the organization cannot take any action against Vanderbilt or any other university that Pavia plays a fifth season for next year.",
      "U.S. District Judge William L. Campbell issued the injunction Wednesday after a hearing Dec. 4. Campbell had asked attorneys both how quickly they could be ready for trial and the transfer portal window, which closes Dec. 28.",
      "\u201cWith Pavia as quarterback, Vanderbilt has seen historic success \u2014 Vanderbilt beat both the University of Alabama and Auburn University \u2014 and the team will be playing in a bowl game for the first time since 2018,\u201d Campbell wrote in an opinion issued with the injunction. \u201cThose familiar with college football appreciate this remarkable accomplishment. Pavia estimates that he could earn over $1 million in NIL compensation in the 2025-26 season.\u201d",
      "Campbell noted current NCAA bylaws make Pavia ineligible to play Division I football in 2025 simply because the quarterback started his career at a junior college.",

      "The brother of the late New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez has pleaded guilty to threatening to carry out a shooting at the University of Connecticut and to kill three people outside of the state last year",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Dennis Hernandez, the troubled brother of the late New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, pleaded guilty Wednesday to threatening to carry out a shooting at the University of Connecticut and to kill three people outside of the state, including a judge, in 2023, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Hernandez, 38, who went by \u201cDJ\u201d while playing football for UConn in the mid-2000s, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to transmitting interstate communications containing a threat to injure, which carries up to five years in prison. Sentencing was set for Feb. 6.",
      "His public defender did not immediately return an email seeking comment Wednesday. A woman who answered a phone number for his mother, Terri Hernandez, declined to comment.",
      "Terri Hernandez told police around the time of his arrest in Bristol last year that he had deteriorating mental health problems including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Dennis Hernandez was shocked with a stun gun and taken into custody after he came out of his sister's house with his arms raised, yelling \u201cshoot me\" and threatening to harm officers, police said.",
      "Federal prosecutors said Hernandez threatened a shooting at UConn's main campus in Storrs in July 2023 while messaging another person on Facebook.",
      "\u201cI would recommend remaining away from there because when I go I\u2019m taking down everything,\" Hernandez wrote, according to court documents. \"And don\u2019t give a (expletive) who gets caught in the crossfire. I\u2019ve died for years now and now it\u2019s others people turn. I\u2019m prepared to give my life. ... Not all shootings are bad I\u2019m realizing. Some are necessary for change to happen.\u201d",
      "Court filings said Hernandez was struggling financially, was frustrated at seeing other people get hired as football coaches and felt owed by UConn. He played quarterback and wide receiver for the Huskies.",
      "Police said Hernandez had driven to the UConn campus and to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he once served as quarterbacks coach, to \u201cmap the schools out\u201d for a shooting.",
      "Also in July 2023, prosecutors said Hernandez made multiple Facebook posts threatening to harm or kill three people who live out of Connecticut, including a state court judge.",
      "Hernandez has pending charges in state court in Connecticut in connection with an incident outside ESPN's headquarters in Bristol. He was arrested in March 2023 on misdemeanor breach of peace charges after police say he threw a bag containing a brick and a note over a fence and onto ESPN\u2019s property before leaving.",
      "\u201cTo all media outlets, It\u2019s about time you all realeyes the affect media has on all family members. Since you\u2019re a world wide leader maybe you could lead how media and messages are delivered brick by brick. Clean it up! Yours truly, Dennis J. Hernandez,\u201d the note said, according to police.",
      "Authorities said Hernandez was angry with people he believed were profiting from the death of his younger brother. Aaron Hernandez killed himself in 2017 while serving a murder sentence."

    "story": [
      "After losing his job as the Atlanta Falcons' starting quarterback, Kirk Cousins is promising to support rookie Michael Penix Jr. Cousins threw nine interceptions with one touchdown in the last five games",
      "FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Kirk Cousins was signed to a massive four-year deal with the Atlanta Falcons because he was perceived to be the missing piece at quarterback for a team that otherwise was ready for a return to the playoffs.",
      "Cousins lost his starting job to rookie Michael Penix Jr. because coach Raheem Morris concluded Cousins' turnovers were the biggest barrier to the team's playoff hopes.",
      "That conclusion was difficult for Cousins to hear from his coach during an unscheduled meeting on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pro football, and it was a standard that I have for myself and the team has for me,\u201d Cousins said Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t playing up to that standard consistently enough.\u201d",
      "In the last five games, the Falcons (7-7) went 1-4 as Cousins threw one touchdown pass with nine interceptions. After holding the NFC South lead at 6-3, the Falcons now need help from first-place Tampa Bay to win the division.",
      "The Falcons, who play the New York Giants at home on Sunday, are one game behind the Buccaneers. Atlanta holds the tiebreaker advantage if it finishes tied with Tampa Bay.",
      "Cousins said he will support Penix but he had a quick answer when asked if he believed he can still start in the NFL.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t forget how to play quarterback,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cCertainly turnovers were not what you want, but I didn\u2019t forget how to play.\u201d",
      "Cousins insisted health and confidence were not issues in his turnovers but instead said he just needs to make better decisions.",
      "The promotion of Penix to the starting role was not a one-week decision. The job belongs to Penix indefinitely.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anything\u2019s ever permanent in the National Football League,\u201d Morris said Wednesday. \u201cBut, you know, right now, Mike Penix is our quarterback and we\u2019re going to back him and give him the utmost support he needs as we did Kirk when he was our starter.\u201d",
      "If Cousins, 36, doesn't start another game for Atlanta, it would be a costly 14-game stint because he signed a four-year, $180 million contract with $100 million guaranteed.",
      "Morris said Falcons owner Arthur Blank was \u201cextremely supportive,\u201d but the coach acknowledged the decision to bench Cousins has financial ramifications. Morris said those factors were outweighed by the drive for the team's first playoff appearance since 2017.",
      "\u201cObviously it definitely has some financial implications for us and how you go about your process,\u201d Morris said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s definitely one of the deals where we\u2019re always going to make football decisions in order to win the football game. And that\u2019s always going to be first and foremost.\u201d",
      "The Falcons have a short week of practice following Monday night's 15-9 win at Las Vegas that snapped a four-game losing streak. Cousins threw for 112 yards with his first TD pass in five games \u2014 and one interception. He leads the NFL with 16 interceptions.",
      "Morris hopes Penix, the No. 8 overall pick out of Washington in this year's draft, can be the difference-maker in the close division race.",
      "\u201cWe want to play better at quarterback,\u201d Morris said. \u201cAnd we felt like we got a chance to play a little bit better. And if we can go out there and play better at quarterback, who knows what can happen?\u201d",
      "Morris said Cousins was disappointed but was \u201can absolute professional\u201d when told of the decision.",
      "\u201cHe definitely expressed to me he\u2019s going to be the best No. 2 quarterback in the National Football League,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Penix has appeared in only two games, completing 3 of 5 passes for 38 yards.",

      "NEW YORK -- In pivoting to Plan B after losing Juan Soto, Brian Cashman went after a familiar name in Cody Bellinger.",
      "\u201cI acquired his dad back in the day. Now I acquired his son,\u201d the New York Yankees general manager said Wednesday.",
      "In the first 10 days after Soto spurned the Yankees for a record $765 million, 15-year contract with the Mets, the Yankees signed left-hander Max Fried to a $218 million, eight-year contract, acquired closer Devin Williams from the Milwaukee Brewers and obtained Bellinger, a former NL MVP, from the Chicago Cubs.",
      "Cashman said the Yankees also had been invited to meet in California with Roki Sasaki, the heralded 23-year-old Japanese pitcher who can sign with Major League Baseball clubs from Jan. 15-23.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just happy we have an opportunity,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cExtremely talented, no doubt about it, has a chance to be one of the world\u2019s great pitchers. Be nice to be able to have Yankee Stadium be his home.\u201d",
      "Because he is under 25, Sasaki is treated by MLB as an international amateur and subject to signing bonus pools for minor league contracts usually allocated to 16-year-old Latin American prospects. Teams have amounts ranging from roughly $7.6 million to $4.1 million they can spend, and the Yankees are capped at around $5.3 million.",
      "Bellinger's father signed with the Yankees in November 1996 and played for the big league team from 1999 to 2001, winning two World Series and three American League pennants. Cody turned 6 in his father's last season in pinstripes.",
      "\u201cSomeone that wants to be here,\u201d Cashman said, a remark that some may read as aimed at Soto. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing it for a long time, including his agent, Scott Boras, saying, `Can you get him over here? He\u2019s driving me crazy. He wants to be a Yankee.' But that\u2019s not why I did it. Ultimately I did it because it\u2019s a fit.\u201d",
      "Bellinger could play outfield or first base depending on other moves the Yankees make.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s different ways of doing it,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to have the perfect team and you'd never know going into an offseason what you\u2019re going to be able to do, whether it\u2019s hammering a strength, whether it\u2019s plugging a hole. It\u2019s kind of where the market and the matchups happen. And so far, I think the moves that we\u2019ve made I\u2019m really excited about. ... I feel like the winter's to this point been a good one.\u201d",
      "Bellinger is guaranteed $52.5 million for the next two seasons. The left-handed-hitting 29-year-old has a $27.5 million salary for next year and a $25 million player option for 2026 with a $5 million buyout.",
      "\u201cHonored to wear the pinstripes, ready and excited to get to work!!\u201d he wrote on Instagram.",
      "Chicago agreed to send the Yankees $5 million: $2.5 million next Sept. 1 and if the option is exercised, five payments of $500,000 on the first of each month from May through September in 2026. If the option is declined, the Cubs would pay the Yankees $2.5 million on Jan. 15, 2026.",
      "Bellinger batted .266 with 18 homers and 78 RBIs in 130 games this year, sidelined between April 23 and May 7 by a broken right rib. He had a 1.035 OPS in 2019 when he was picked for his second All-Star team and won the NL MVP award with the Los Angeles Dodgers. It has been above .800 once in the last five years.",
      "\u201cI do feel like offensively speaking, he\u2019ll play up in our yard and he\u2019s still a young man and a really good athlete,\u201d Boone said. \u201cSo you always hope for the ultimate upside but at the very least I know we\u2019re getting a really valuable player.\u201d",
      "Boone spoke with Bellinger on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cHe's like, `By the way, don\u2019t worry about where you play me. I\u2019ll play wherever. Wherever you need me that night, whether it\u2019s center, left, first, whatever it may be,'\u201d Boone recalled.",
      "Williams will become the Yankees closer, and Boone and pitching coach Matt Blake said they both assured Luke Weaver he will have a prominent role.",

      "The lawsuits target the low-carbon fuel standard, which requires California to reduce the environmental impact of transportation fuels by incentivizing producers to cut emissions. The California Air Resources Board voted last month to increase the state\u2019s emission reduction targets, fund charging infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, and phase out incentives for capturing methane emissions from dairy farms to turn into fuel.",
      "California, which often leads the nation on climate policy, plans to achieve so-called carbon neutrality by 2045, meaning the state will remove as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits. The state has passed policies in recent years to phase out the sale of new fossil-fuel powered cars, trucks, trains and lawn mowers.",
      "One of the lawsuits filed this week, by the nonprofit Communities for a Better Environment, accuses the board of failing to thoroughly analyze the climate impacts of burning biofuels derived from plants and animal waste. Another, filed by Food and Water Watch, Central Valley Defenders of Clean Air and Water, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund, focuses on the impact of pollution often impacting low-income and Latino communities from the capture of methane from cow manure to turn into fuel.",

      "The company says it doesn't expect the strike to impact holiday shipments.",
      "Amazon has a couple hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters mainly have focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors that handle package deliveries for the company. But Amazon has rebuffed demands to come to the negotiating table since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees.",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters also says the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:46:20 -0500",

    "story": [
      "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Sloths weren\u2019t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge \u2014 up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) \u2014 and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier \u2014 perhaps far earlier \u2014 than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\u201cThere was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly \u2014 what\u2019s called \u2018Pleistocene overkill,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \u201chumans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms \u2014 a bit like the plates of modern armadillos \u2014 that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there\u2019s a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\u201cWe believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\u201d she said. Three similar \u201cpendant\u201d fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table \u2014 those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old \u2014 more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco\u2019s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \u201cfresh bones\u201d shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas \u2014 and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a big debate,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \u201cWhat I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\u201d she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America \u2014 giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time \u2014 with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% \u2014 many researchers surmised that humans\u2019 arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Human Origins Program. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really work so well anymore.\u201d",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods \u2014 including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques \u2014 coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\u201cAnything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\u201d said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \u201cBut really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\u201d",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\u201cWe found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\u201d in \u201cfresh bones\u201d \u2014 meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites \u2014 whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn\u2019t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\u201cMonte Verde was a shock. You\u2019re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \u201ccut marks\u201d on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it\u2019s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\u201d said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \u201cWhy would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to find the oldest anything \u2014 we\u2019ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,\u201d he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans\u2019 arrival in the Americas remains contested \u2014 and may never be known \u2014 it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn\u2019t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \u201ca giant ground sloth going along on four feet\u201d when it encounters the footprints of a small human who\u2019s recently dashed by. The huge animal \u201cstops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "Suspected drone sightings in the eastern U.S. are continuing to captivate many, but the federal government's authority to track and disable any threatening unmanned aircraft is set to expire after Friday",
      "As suspected drone sightings over the eastern U.S. including New Jersey continue to captivate many, the federal government's authority to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed threatening is set to expire after Friday and a temporary spending bill before Congress that would extend that power is now in question.",
      "Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17.",
      "Federal and local authorities have been investigating sightings of suspected drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. In fact, authorities say, many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars.",
      "Tucked into the bipartisan plan to prevent a government shutdown is a provision that would extend the authority of the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed a credible threat from Dec. 20 until March 14.",
      "That authority is vital, homeland security officials and experts say, to detect and disable any threatening drones flying near military bases, the president's location, U.S. borders, prisons and mass gatherings such as New Year's Eve celebrations and the Super Bowl \u2014 and they were hopeful a reauthorization of those powers will be approved before Friday's expiration.",
      "But the temporary spending bill including the reauthorization fell into question Wednesday when President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected it and told Republicans to essentially renegotiate only days before the deadline when federal funding runs out. Congress continued working Thursday to pass a bill to avert a shutdown.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what a lapse in that authority would mean, including to drone detection systems the federal government has deployed to states, including New Jersey where numerous sightings have been reported, at the request of local officials. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office referred questions about the detection systems to Homeland Security officials.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday declined to comment on the expiration of the drone authorities. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, along with other Biden administration officials and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, has repeatedly called for the reauthorization and expansion of the authority for \u201ccounter-unmanned aerial systems\u201d operations, or C-UAS.",
      "\u201cEnsuring that existing authorities do not lapse is vital to our mission, including protecting the president and vice president, patrolling certain designated areas along the Southwest Border, securing certain federal facilities and assets, and safeguarding the public,\u201d Mayorkas told the House Homeland Security Committee in November 2023. \u201cAny lapse in DHS\u2019s current C-UAS authority would entail serious risks for our homeland security, as DHS would have to cease or curtail existing C-UAS operations.\"",
      "Bills in the House and Senate that would extend and expand the federal government's drone powers remain pending. The bills also would allow state and local officials for the first time to track and disable threatening drones under a pilot program overseen by federal authorities.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, was blocked from quickly advancing the Senate bill when Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, objected to its passage. Paul said it wasn\u2019t clear there is a threat from drones that warrants urgent action."

    "story": [
      "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
      "Detroit -- China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year.",
      "Battery swapping is not new \u2014 but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure.",
      "While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries.",
      "Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes.",
      "An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap \u2014 and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery.",
      "China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries.",
      "Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric \u2014 and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales.",
      "China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed.",
      "The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007.",
      "But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time.",
      "Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That\u2019s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge.",
      "But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November.",
      "Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain.",
      "Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale.",
      "Swapping could help with EV cost \u2014 currently a barrier to adoption for many \u2014 because a driver wouldn\u2019t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery.",
      "Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping. To him, it's not unlike buying a propane-fueled grill and purchasing a refilled tank every so often. But it would require a rethinking of car ownership.",
      "\"Where I could see it working is if we went entirely away from vehicle ownership and we went to a use-on-demand model,\" Less added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d",
      "Battery swapping might make most sense for ride-sharing or other fleet vehicles.",
      "Drivers of buses, taxis, Uber or Lyft vehicles want to spend as much time on the road as possible, transporting customers and making money. If battery swapping can shorten the time needed to charge EVs, that makes driving one less disruptive to their business.",

      "The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules.",
      "But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government.

      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool.",
      "Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhile Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.",
      "Blumenthal in a separate statement added that he was calling on \"Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.\u201d",
      "It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia.",
      "Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls.",
      "China, meanwhile, has created \u201cvast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,\u201d the subcommittee report asserts.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S.",
      "But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement.",
      "The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",
      "The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies\u2019 export control plans by outside entities.",

      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",
      "The report also cited someone that said Djerf had installed her own toilet at the company that could only be used by her and \u201cher favorites.\u201d One employee had to scrub the toilet because it was used by the wrong person, it said.",
      "\u201cWhen I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\u201d Djerf wrote in her post on Instagram, where she has 3 million followers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture. She said the company has hired a \u201cmore experienced\u201d management team and were teaming up with an external organizational psychologist who could talk to employees.",
      "Djerf Avenue is also now doing monthly anonymous surveys to collect feedback from workers, the post said.",
      "Last year, Djerf was featured on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list along with her boyfriend Rasmus Johansson, who co-founded the clothing label with her in 2019.",
      "Known for her \u201cclean girl\u201d aesthetic looks and bouncy hair, Djerf recently had a prominent campaign with model Hailey Bieber\u2019s skincare and beauty line, Rhode."

      "SCOTCHTOWN, N.Y. -- Scholars are hailing the discovery of a fossilized mastodon jaw discovered by a man who spotted two giant teeth while gardening at his upstate New York home this year.",
      "The mastodon jaw and some other bone fragments were found in late September in a backyard near Scotchtown, a hamlet about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, officials from the New York State Museum said.",
      "The owner of the backyard does not want to be identified, said Robert Feranec, the state museum's director of research and collections and curator of Ice Age animals.",
      "The individual spotted what he first thought were baseballs, Feranec said Wednesday. \u201cHe picked them up and realized they were teeth,\u201d he said.",
      "Excavation by staff from the museum and the State University of New York's Orange County campus yielded a full, well-preserved jaw of an adult mastodon as well as a piece of a toe bone and a rib fragment, museum officials said.",
      "\u201cWhile the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,\u201d said Cory Harris, chair of SUNY Orange's behavioral sciences department. \u201cWe are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.\u201d",
      "Officials with the Albany-based state museum said the jaw was the first complete mastodon jaw found in New York in 11 years. They said there have been more than 150 fossils from the extinct elephant relative found statewide to date, about a third of them in Orange County in the same area as the recent find.",
      "Feranec said the newly unearthed jaw provides \u201ca unique opportunity to study the ecology of this magnificent species, which will enhance our understanding of the Ice Age ecosystems from this region.\u201d",
      "The fossils will be carbon-dated and analyzed to determine the mastodon\u2019s age, diet and habitat during its lifetime and will be put on public display sometime in 2025, museum officials said."

    "story": [
      "The federal government says that two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts and that one is likely to die from its injuries",
      "Two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts, and one is likely to die from its injuries, the federal government said.",
      "They are North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 400 and face existential threats from entanglement in gear and collisions with ships. An aerial survey found the whales swimming about 50 miles southeast of Nantucket on Dec. 9, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.",
      "One of the whales is a juvenile that has a thick line that passes across its head and back and is likely to succumb to the injury, the agency said in a statement. The other whale is an adult female who biologists think has suffered a sublethal injury from the entanglement, NOAA said.",
      "NOAA said in a statement Tuesday that it would \u201cwork with authorized responders and trained experts to monitor the whales\u201d and that it will \u201cfurther document the entanglements and determine if entanglement responses will be possible.\u201d",
      "The news of the entangled whales follows the release of new data from researchers this fall showing a slight uptick in the whale's population. A group of researchers said two months ago that the population increased about 4% from 2020.",
      "However, those researchers and environmental advocates cautioned at the time that the whales still faced the threat of extinction. The animal's population fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The entanglement of the two whales illustrates the need for new safeguards to protect the animals, said Gib Brogan, campaign director at Oceana. Environmentalists have pushed for new restrictions on commercial fishing and shipping to try to protect the whales.",
      "\u201cThese whales are not statistics; they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities,\u201d Brogan said.",
      "The whales migrate every year and usually arrive in Cape Cod Bay in early winter and stay until around the middle of May. They give birth off the coasts of Georgia and Florida and are slow to reproduce, which is one of the reasons conservationists say they can't withstand additional mortality.",
      "The whales were once abundant off the East Coast, but they were decimated during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "Some scientists have said climate change is a major threat to the whales because it has changed the availability of their food. That has caused them to stray from protected areas of ocean.",
      "\u201cNorth Atlantic right whales continue to be entangled at levels that could push this critically endangered species to extinction. It is distressing that multiple generations of right whales have been affected by the devastating harm of entanglements, which is resulting in deaths, health declines, and slower reproductive rates,\" said Amy Knowlton, senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium.",

    "story": [
      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",
      "But he also said that the government should do more to help shoppers buy electric cars because \u201cpeople don\u2019t really go for electric cars here.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, clad in tuxedo and black tie, took the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after the election with all the swagger of the winning candidate himself.",
      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",
      "\u201cEven though there\u2019s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",
      "\u201cHaving your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I\u2019m paying someone to not work for my company,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d",
      "But despite his skepticism, Gerber said he won\u2019t stop investing in Musk\u2019s businesses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of money with Elon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of investing based on the popularity of CEOs.\u201d",
      "Musk doesn\u2019t appear to give Trump much boost with people who don\u2019t back the incoming president.",
      "He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world\u2019s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk \u2014 again, similar to Trump.",
      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",
      "Investors, he said, are betting on Musk and see his political ascent as a \u201cchampagne moment.\u201d Unlike Gerber, Ives believes that ending the EV credit and taking subsidies from Detroit carmakers, Hyundai and other companies will create only opportunity for Tesla.",
      "\u201cI think Wall Street is starting to fully digest the potential benefits from Musk,\u201d Ives said.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock price has nearly doubled since Trump\u2019s victory, creating an additional $750 billion shareholder wealth in the past six weeks. But Gerber feels that jump is because investors believe Tesla will have an advantage when it comes to autonomous driving because Trump could grant the company a national autonomy license.",
      "Still, he thinks Tesla will be the \u201cbig loser\u201d of Musk\u2019s businesses because of Trump\u2019s promise to end the EV tax credit for carmakers.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla, I don\u2019t see a ton of benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cElon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 including his artificial intelligence company, xAI \u2014 could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.",
      "\u201cAI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",

      "Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have confirmed that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger.",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price soared nearly 24% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world\u2019s third-largest automaking group. Honda\u2019s share price fell as much as 3%. Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is also part of the talks.",
      "Trading in Nissan\u2019s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were \u201cconsidering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\u201d",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "A Japanese space startup says its second attempt to launch a rocket carrying satellites into orbit had been aborted minutes after liftoff",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese space startup said its second attempt to launch a rocket carrying satellites into orbit had been aborted minutes after liftoff Wednesday and destroyed itself again, nine months after the company's first launch attempt ended in an explosion.",
      "Space One's Kairos No. 2 rocket lifted off from a coastal site in the mountainous prefecture of Wakayama in central Japan.",
      "The company said it had aborted the flight after concluding that it was unlikely to complete its mission.",
      "\u201cWe are very sorry that we could not achieve as far as a final stage of the mission,\u201d Space One President Masakazu Toyoda told a news conference Wednesday. \u201cWe don't consider this a failure because we are getting valuable data that will help our pursuit toward a next challenge.\u201d",
      "He said he hoped to find the cause to address the problems as soon as possible to achieve a success next time.",
      "Company executive and space engineer Mamoru Endo said the abnormality in the first stage engine nozzle or its control system is likely to have caused an unstable flight of the rocket, which started spiraling in midflight and eventually destroyed itself about three minutes after liftoff, using its autonomous safety mechanism.",
      "The rocket, which rose higher than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above ground, entered space entered space before it was destroyed, officials said.",
      "Space One aims to be Japan\u2019s first company to put a satellite into orbit, hoping to boost Japan\u2019s lagging space industry with a small rocket for an affordable space transport business.",
      "Wednesday's flight, postponed twice from Saturday because of strong winds, came nine months after a failed debut flight in March, when the rocket was intentionally exploded five seconds after takeoff. The flight was carrying a government satellite that was intended to monitor North Korea\u2019s missile launches and other military activities.",
      "Kairos No. 2 rocket was carrying five small satellites, including one from the Taiwanese space agency and several from Japanese startups.",
      "Space One said it had fixed the cause of the debut flight failure, which stemmed from a miscalculation of the rocket\u2019s first-stage propulsion.",
      "Japan hopes the company can pave the way for a domestic space industry that competes with the United States.",
      "Tokyo-based Space One was set up in 2018 with investments from major Japanese companies, including Canon Electronics, IHI, Shimizu and major banks, to commercialize space delivery services at lower costs and regular flights as many as 20 times a year, compared to six currently planned by the government-led space program.",
      "Japan\u2019s space development programs are led by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, and industry leaders such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI, as they develop two main flagship rockets, the large H3 rocket and the much smaller Epsilon, to cater to the growing satellite transport business.",

      "Scientists in China have almost finished building a massive underground detector to sniff out mysterious particles called neutrinos",
      "KAIPING, China -- Underneath a granite hill in southern China, a massive detector is nearly complete that will sniff out the mysterious ghost particles lurking around us.",
      "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory will soon begin the difficult task of spotting neutrinos: tiny cosmic particles with a mind-bogglingly small mass.",
      "The detector is one of three being built across the globe to study these elusive ghost particles in the finest detail yet. The other two, based in the United States and Japan, are still under construction.",
      "Spying neutrinos is no small feat in the quest to understand how the universe came to be. The Chinese effort, set to go online next year, will push the technology to new limits, said Andre de Gouvea, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIf they can pull that off,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be amazing.\u201d",
      "Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator.",
      "Scientists have known about the existence of neutrinos for almost a century, but they\u2019re still in the early stages of figuring out what the particles really are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least understood particle in our world,\u201d said Cao Jun, who helps manage the detector known as JUNO. \"That\u2019s why we need to study it.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no way to spot the tiny neutrinos whizzing around on their own. Instead, scientists measure what happens when they collide with other bits of matter, producing flashes of light or charged particles.",
      "Neutrinos bump into other particles only very rarely, so to up their chances of catching a collision, physicists have to think big.",
      "\u201cThe solution for how we measure these neutrinos is to build very, very big detectors,\u201d de Gouvea said.",
      "The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities.",
      "On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, they'll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water.",
      "It'll study antineutrinos \u2014 an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior \u2014 produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, they'll produce a flash of light.",
      "The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest.",
      "Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very daring thing to even go after it,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, it\u2019ll take some time to collect and analyze the data \u2014 so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos.",
      "Two similar neutrino detectors \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States \u2013 are under construction. They\u2019re set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detector\u2019s results using different approaches.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics,\u201d said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.",
      "Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, they\u2019ve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re part of the big picture,\u201d Scholberg said.",
      "One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart \u2014 called antimatter \u2014 largely snuffed out.",
      "Scientists don't know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter.",
      "The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. They'll have to catch them to find out.",

So there\u2019s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration\u2033 to address it.",

    "summary": "President Joe Biden is expected to soon secure the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden is expected to soon secure the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is expected to secure the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency as soon as Friday, an accomplishment that exceeds his predecessor's total by one after Democrats put extra emphasis on the federal courts following Donald Trump's far-reaching first term when he filled three seats to the Supreme Court.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has teed up votes on two potential California district judges, likely to be the last judicial confirmations this year before the Congress adjourns and makes way for a new, Republican-led Senate. He said he hoped to complete the votes by the end of Friday.",
      "The first confirmation will tie Trump's number, the second will break it. Come next year, Republicans will look to boost Trump's already considerable influence on the makeup of the federal judiciary in his second term.",
      "Biden and Senate Democrats placed particular focus on adding women, minorities and public defenders to the judicial rank. About two-thirds of Biden's appointees are women and a majority of appointees are people of color. The most notable appointee was Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African-American woman to serve on the nation's highest court.",
      "\u201cPrior to our effort, the number of women on the federal bench was really diminished. It was overwhelmingly white males,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cWe consciously moved forward to bring more women to the bench, and believe me, we had a great talent pool to work with. So I think it'll enhance the image of the court and its work product to bring these new judges on.\u201d",
      "Biden also placed an emphasis on bringing more civil rights lawyers, public defenders and labor rights lawyers to expand the professional backgrounds of the federal judiciary. More than 45 appointees are public defenders and more than two dozen served as civil rights lawyers.",
      "While Biden did get more district judges confirmed than Trump, he had fewer of higher-tier circuit court appointments than Trump \u2014 45 compared to 54 for Trump. And he got one Supreme Court appointment compared to three for Trump. Republicans, much to Democrats frustration, filled Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the court the week before the 2020 presidential election. Ginsburg had passed away in September.",
      "Democrats also faced the challenge of confirming nominees during two years of a 50-50 Senate. Rarely a week went by in the current Congress when Schumer did not tee up votes on a judicial confirmation as liberal groups urged Democrats to show the same kind of urgency on judges that Republicans exhibited under Trump.",
      "Some Senate Republicans were harshly critical of Biden's choices. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said talk of diversity did not extend to the views of the nominees.",
      "\"One of the consequences of the age of Trump is that it drove Democrats insane and it drove them to the extreme left, so they put people on the bench who were selected because they were extreme partisans,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "Liberal-leaning advocacy groups said they are delighted with the number of judges Democrats secured, but even more so with the quality of the nominees. They said diversity in personal and professional backgrounds improves judicial decision-making, helps build public trust and inspires people from all walks of life to pursue legal careers.",
      "\u201cFor our federal judiciary to actually deliver equal justice for all, it really has to be for all, and that is one reason why we certainly applaud this administration for prioritizing both professional but also demographic diversity,\u201d said Lena Zwarensteyn, senior director of the fair courts program at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.",
      "Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Democrats showed newfound resolve on judicial confirmations.",
      "\u201cThey learned a lesson from the first Trump administration,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cPaying attention to the number of judges you get and the type of judges you put on the court is worth it.\u201d",
      "Part of the urgency from Democrats came as they watched the nation's highest court overturn abortion protections, eliminate affirmative action in higher education and weaken the federal government's ability to protect the environment, public health and workplace safety through regulations. The cases showed that the balance of power in Washington extends to the judicial branch.",
      "Trump will inherit nearly three dozen judicial vacancies, but that number is expected to rise because of Republican-appointed judges who held off on retirement in hopes that a Republican would return to office and pick their replacement.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., acknowledged that the sense of accomplishment for Democrats is muted somewhat knowing that Trump will have another term to continue shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not ready to uncork the champagne just because we\u2019ve done some really good work over the last four years,\" Blumenthal said. \"We need to be prepared to work, hope for the best and try to defeat nominees who are simply unqualified.

      "The Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday disqualified Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from her prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump and his co-defendants in their election interference case.",
      "\"After carefully considering the trial court's findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office\" over what the appeals court called \"a significant appearance of impropriety,\" the ruling said.",
      "The criminal indictment against Trump and his co-defendants still stands, the court said.",
      "Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty last year to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia.",
      "Defendants Kenneth Chesebro, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis and Scott Hall subsequently took plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify against other defendants.",
      "Following the Thursday's ruling, the Fulton County DA's office filed notice that they intend to appeal the decision to the Georgia Supreme Court. A spokesperson for the DA's office declined to comment further to ABC News.",
      "The appeals court ruling leaves the question of who takes over the case -- and whether it continues -- to the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia. That decision may be delayed due to the appeals process.",
      "The case has been on pause after Trump and his co-defendants launched an effort to have Willis disqualified from the case over her relationship with fellow prosecutor Nathan Wade. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis, leading Trump to appeal that decision.",
      "The appeals court ruled to disqualify Willis and her entire office from the case because \"no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings,\" the ruling said.",
      "\"The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring,\" the order said, reversing Judge McAfee's original decision.",
      "Wade, who had been the lead prosecutor in the case, resigned as special prosecutor in March after McAfee issued his ruling that either Willis or Wade must step aside from the case due to a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" stemming from a romantic relationship between the DA and the prosecutor.",
      "While the appeals court disqualified Willis and her office, it did not find enough evidence to justify \"the extreme sanction\" of tossing the entire indictment against Trump and his co-defendants, as Trump had sought in his appeal.",
      "\"While this is the rare case in which DA Willis and her office must be disqualified due to a significant appearance of impropriety, we cannot conclude that the record also supports the imposition of the extreme sanction of dismissal of the indictment under the appropriate standard,\" the ruling said.",
      "\"The Georgia Court Of Appeals in a well-reasoned and just decision has held that DA Fani Willis\u2019 misconduct in the case against President Trump requires the disqualification of Willis and her office,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow said in response to the ruling. \"The Court highlighted that Willis\u2019 misconduct created an 'odor of mendacity' and an appearance of impropriety that could only be cured by the disqualification of her and her entire office. As the Court rightfully noted, only the remedy of disqualification will suffice to restore public confidence.\"",
      "Judge Clay Land -- one of the three judges on the appeals panel -- dissented from the decision, arguing that reversing the trial court \"violates well-established precedent, threatens the discretion given to trial courts, and blurs the distinction between our respective courts.\"",
      "Land argued that the appearance of impropriety -- rather than a true conflict of interest -- is not enough to reverse Judge McAfee's decision not to disqualify Willis.",
      "\"For at least the last 43 years, our appellate courts have held that an appearance of impropriety, without an actual conflict of interest or actual impropriety, provides no basis for the reversal of a trial court's denial of a motion to disqualify,\" he wrote.",
      "In his dissent, Land emphasized that the trial court found that Willis did not have a conflict of interest and rejected the allegations of impropriety stemming from her relationship with Wade, including the allegation that she received a financial benefit from his hiring.",
      "\"It was certainly critical of her choices and chastised her for making them. I take no issue with that criticism, and if the trial court had chosen, in its discretion, to disqualify her and her office, this would be a different case,\" he wrote. \"But that is not the remedy the trial court chose, and I believe our case law prohibits us from rejecting that remedy just because we don't like it or just because we might have gone further had we been the trial judge.\"",
      "The Georgia election interference case is one of four criminal cases that were brought against Trump after he left the White House in 2021. His two federal cases, on charges of interfering with the 2020 election and refusing to return classified documents, were dropped following Trump's reelection last month, due to a longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump's sentencing in New York, following his conviction on charges of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 election, was postponed indefinitely following Trump\u2019s reelection last month."

    "title": "Why most of Trump's Cabinet picks will get confirmed by the Senate",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 13:51:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Why most of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks will probably be confirmed.",
    "story": [
      "Nominees face more opposition nowadays, but rarely from the president's party.",
      "In the wake of his November victory, President-elect Donald Trump has already had a fairly messy rollout of his Cabinet nominees. His first choice for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration, and some of his other picks have their own personal scandals or controversies to overcome in the Senate confirmation process.",
      "Yet despite some less than optimal headlines, the Republican-controlled Senate will likely confirm nearly all of Trump's Cabinet nominees and picks for other key positions. Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority in the next Senate, so if the GOP remains relatively unified, most of Trump's nominees will get across the finish line. And with senators from the two parties now farther apart ideologically than they've ever been in modern times, almost all GOP senators will back Trump's choices \u2014 and most Democrats will probably oppose them.",
      "None of this precludes further developments that could lead another nominee to withdraw due to controversy or scandal, or that one nominee could go down to defeat on the Senate floor \u2014 something that hasn't happened since 1989. But considering Trump's especially dominant sway within his party as well as those broader trends, it's easy to see how the Senate could confirm even some of his most controversial picks.",
      "Nominees face more opposition, but senators stick with their parties",
      "Cabinet confirmation votes used to be a formality; throughout most of the 20th century, presidents' Cabinet nominees were typically confirmed unanimously or near-unanimously. But over the past 30 years, the amount of opposition to presidents' nominees to Cabinet posts and certain positions that have been or are currently considered Cabinet-level* has distinctly increased. President Joe Biden's nominees had the second-highest number of total votes against them across all confirmation votes in the Senate during his nearly four years in office. This puts him second only to Trump during the president-elect's first term, when many of his nominees encountered substantial opposition.",
      "Of course, Trump's turnover-prone first administration had a record number of nominees for Cabinet and Cabinet-level posts, so he also had more opportunities for the Senate to cast votes against his choices. Still, we can see an upward trend beyond Trump, too. The 25 Senate roll call votes for Biden's nominees was similar to the 23 that former President Barack Obama had during his second term and the 22 that former President George H.W. Bush had during his four years in office. But Biden's Cabinet-level selections produced 634 \"no\" votes, whereas Obama's generated 420, and Bush's sparked fewer than 100.",
      "Fact is, confirmation votes have grown more partisan and more contentious over time. We can see this if we break down the average number of \"no\" votes cast against each president's nominees by whether they came from their own party's senators or from the opposing party. Perhaps unsurprisingly, votes against nominees are up thanks almost entirely due to growing opposition from the party not in the White House. Inversely, senators from the president's party hardly ever vote against Cabinet-level nominees.",
      "With 53 senators in the next Congress, Republicans can afford up to three defections and still win votes via Vice President-elect JD Vance's tiebreaking vote. But in recent times, Cabinet-level nominees have faced an average of less than one vote in opposition from senators of the president's party. Biden's nominees averaged about 25 \"no\" votes during his one term, but practically all of those came from Republicans. Similarly, Trump's first term saw an average of about 29 \"no\" votes per nominee, yet almost all came from Democrats. It is true that more controversial nominees who might inspire more intraparty opposition don't necessarily make it to the floor, as the withdrawal of nominees has become more common. Still, we have to go back to the 1970s to find any presidential term in which senators from the president's party averaged more than one vote against a nominee.",
      "In light of this trend, it's unsurprising that Democrats moved to eliminate the filibuster for Cabinet selections in 2013, at the start of Obama's second term, to make it easier for him to get his nominees. Back then, Democrats held a majority in the Senate but had far fewer than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster by invoking cloture, which then allows the Senate to move to an up-or-down vote on a nominee. Tellingly, about one-in-six of Obama's picks who faced a roll call vote during his second term received fewer than 60 votes on the Senate floor, while the same was true for about one-fourth of Biden's nominees. The removal of the filibuster limitation certainly aided Trump during his first term, too, and likely will again this time around. Back then, nearly half of Trump's nominees fell short of 60 votes while still winning confirmation.",
      "An increasingly partisan Senate and nomination process",
      "Before the 1970s, presidents rarely got pushback from the Senate on their Cabinet picks. Senators mostly deferred to the president's prerogative, with the view that presidents should have the advisers and administration officials they wanted unless those choices were especially scandalous or unqualified. Consequently, the Senate OK'd most of the president's picks without even taking a recorded vote, simply confirming them by voice vote on the Senate floor \u2014 a sign that the selections faced no or extremely limited opposition. During the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, just four of 74 total nominees faced a roll call vote. Outside of denying former Atomic Energy Commission Chair Lewis Strauss the post of commerce secretary in 1959 \u2014 which you might be familiar with if you saw the film \"Oppenheimer\" \u2014 the Senate nearly always acquiesced to the president's choices. Fast forward to today, however, and virtually all Cabinet-level nominees now must contend with a recorded vote in the Senate.",
      "A combination of growing executive power and rising political polarization helped bring about this shift. Over the course of the 20th century, the power of the president and the executive branch grew at the expense of Congress, as what became known as the \"imperial presidency\" rose to hold greater agenda-setting and policy-making prerogatives. In the early 1970s, Congress attempted to rein in the presidency by passing legislation to limit the president's latitude for unilateral military action and compel the president to provide greater transparency regarding executive budgetary practices. At the same time, the Senate also began to more aggressively scrutinize and demonstrate opposition to Cabinet-level appointments. To wit, across former President Richard Nixon's roughly one and a half terms in office, one-third of his nominees (15 of 45) faced a roll call vote, a major change from his immediate predecessors.",
      "Around the same time, the two major political parties began to become more ideologically coherent and started to move apart from each other, a process that has continued to this day. Conservatives moved more clearly into the Republican camp, while liberals shifted into the Democrats' corner, changes that brought with them more distinct policy differences and greater disdain for the opposition. This produced a growing divide between the ideological stances of Democratic and Republican senators, as shown by Voteview.com's DW-NOMINATE measure, which uses senators' voting records to place them on a continuum from -1 (most liberal) to 1 (most conservative). The gap between the average senator from each party has increased as Democrats have shifted to the left and, especially, Republicans have swung to the right.",
      "In this environment, nominations for Cabinet-level posts take longer and face more opposition than they once did. Consider how much longer it takes the Senate to finish confirming most of the high-profile secretariats for the 15 executive departments in a newly elected president's Cabinet. Through former President Ronald Reagan's first term, most newly elected presidents had their department heads confirmed within just a couple of weeks of taking office \u2014 i.e., by early February. But since then, each incoming president other than George W. Bush has taken until March at the earliest to fill out these top posts; Obama and Trump even took until late April. And this happened even though every elected president from Reagan to Biden (except the elder Bush) entered the White House with his party at least narrowly controlling the Senate.",
      "Trump's special flavor of party loyalty",
      "Now, this historical data doesn't mean that the next Senate absolutely will behave the same way. The controversial nature of some of Trump's choices, such as nominating vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, could brook enough opposition even within the GOP to stall out some picks. However, this is where there could be an especially impactful interaction between the increasingly polarized nomination process and Trump's particularly strong hold on the Republican Party.",
      "Pricing in increased pushback from the opposition party, members of the president's party now face greater pressure than ever to confirm nominees. Take the ongoing debate over former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for secretary of defense. Hegseth faces allegations of sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse. These sorts of personal scandals have precipitated the failure or withdrawal of many past nominees. In fact, the last time the Senate outright rejected a Cabinet pick involved both similar issues and the same secretariat: In March 1989, former Sen. John Tower's nomination to become George H.W. Bush's defense secretary failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate, driven in part by allegations of alcoholism and womanizing.",
      "Yet enough Republican senators may back Hegseth for him to join the Cabinet. The delicate position of GOP Sen. Joni Ernst exemplifies how. Ernst, who sits on the Armed Services Committee that will handle Hegseth's nomination, is the first female combat veteran in the Senate, and she also disclosed in 2019 that she'd been sexually assaulted in the past. Earlier this month, she expressed skepticism toward Hegseth's nomination, telling Fox News that she hadn't yet decided to back him. But Ernst is also up for reelection in red-leaning Iowa in 2026. Following a whirlwind of criticism from Trump and his allies, along with threats of a possible primary challenge, Ernst expressed a more favorable view of Hegseth's nomination.",
      "Trump's Cabinet-level nominees will face substantial opposition in the Senate, especially compared with past presidencies. However, there's ample reason to think that, when push comes to shove, most Republicans will vote for his picks for most offices \u2014 if not just about all of them. With 53 seats in the next Senate, the GOP is well positioned to do Trump's bidding. Otherwise, incumbent senators may have to risk their political careers to oppose some of Trump's selections.",

      "The tourists, including Australians and an American, were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, Fiji\u2019s Health Ministry said.",
      "News outlets had reported the cause of the foreigners\u2019 illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos last month in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming drinks tainted with methanol.",
      "The suspicion of methanol poisoning was a blow to Fiji\u2019s tourism industry, which has a reputation for providing safe food and drinks.",
      "Alcohol poisoning is a common danger in many poorly regulated tourist destinations, where reputable brands of spirits are substituted with locally distilled ethanol. Methanol can be an unintended byproduct of unprofessional distillation.",

      "\u201cWe'd like to tell everybody that it's safe to come to Fiji and we have to also find out who has been giving out the negative press about Fiji as a destination. Are they competitors for our tourist visitors?\u201d Rabuka said to reporters."

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- A Department of Homeland Security agent who the FBI says conspired with another agent to sell an illicit drug known as \u201cbath salts\u201d pleaded not guilty to a drug distribution conspiracy charge Friday in federal court.",
      "A grand jury in Salt Lake City brought the criminal charge against Special Agent David Cole of the Homeland Security Investigations unit earlier this week. The indictment alleges that Cole abused his position as a federal law enforcement agent to obtain and sell drugs for profit. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.",
      "Cole took drugs that had been seized as evidence, telling colleagues he was using them for legitimate investigations, and instead sold them to a confidential informant who resold the drugs for profit on the streets of Utah, according to the indictment.",

But in addition to conducting controlled buys from suspected drug dealers as directed by investigators, the informant said he was compelled by Cole and another agent to also engage in illegal sales.",
      "The investigation began after the informant\u2019s defense attorney contacted the U.S. Attorney in Utah in October to report that agents had required him to engage in potentially illegal acts dating from last spring to early December. Details of drug sales offered by the informant were confirmed through surveillance and other sources, the FBI said.",
      "Cole and the second agent \u2014 identified in court documents only as \u201cPerson A\u201d \u2014 profited up to $300,000 from the illegal scheme, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case.",
      "FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker said Friday that \u201cPerson A\u201d had not been arrested or charged, but the investigation was ongoing.",
      "Cole, 50, of South Jordan, Utah, entered the courtroom Friday handcuffed and hunched over, wearing a white and gray, striped jumpsuit. U.S. Magistrate Judge Dustin Pead accepted Cole's not guilty plea and scheduled a trial for the week of Feb. 24.",

      "Cole\u2019s attorney, Alexander Ramos, has declined to directly address the criminal allegations but said his client has a strong reputation within the federal law enforcement community. Ramos did not immediately respond Friday to emails seeking comment on the not guilty plea.",
      "The Homeland Security Investigations department where Cole worked conducts federal criminal investigations into the illegal movement of people, goods, money, weapons, drugs and sensitive technology into, out of and across the U.S. Cole and the second agent had their credentials suspended but have not been fired, according to court documents."

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 13:54:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Huge gates at the mouths of three inlets and barriers across bays are no longer part of a plan to protect New Jersey&rsquo;s back bays from the type of catastrophic flooding they endured during Superstorm Sandy",
    "story": [
      "Huge gates at the mouths of three inlets and barriers across bays are no longer part of a plan to protect New Jersey\u2019s back bays from the type of catastrophic flooding they endured during Superstorm Sandy",
      "MANASQUAN, N.J. -- The federal government has dropped huge gates at the mouths of three inlets, as well as internal waterway barriers from a plan to protect New Jersey's back bays from the type of catastrophic flooding they endured during Superstorm Sandy.",
      "Instead, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a plan released Friday wants to rely more on elevating thousands of homes, hardening police and fire stations, hospitals and critical infrastructure, and restoring salt marshes to act as natural sponges capable of absorbing floodwaters during severe storms.",
      "The changes would reduce the cost of the plan from $16 billion to $7.6 billion, and remove a major point of contention raised by homeowners, environmentalists and some local governments concerned about damage to the views of inlets and bays, potential harm to fish and wildlife, and the cost of maintaining the massive projects, which local governments would have to pay.",
      "But the scaled-down project would be less effective, the Army Corps acknowledged.",
      "\u201cThe storm surge barrier analyses remains valuable, and can be revisited at a future phase, but they ultimately required years of engineering work and environmental coordination, and we wanted to release a plan with elements that could be move forward in the near term,\u201d said Stephen Rochette, a spokesman for the Army Corps.",
      "Without some sort of storm protection plan, New Jersey's back bay regions could sustain $2.6 billion a year in flood-related damage to property, infrastructure and vehicles each year between 2040 and 2090, the Corps projected. The study covered the area from Neptune in Monmouth County all the way to the state\u2019s southern tip in Cape May.",
      "The original recommendation called for large storm gates across the Manasquan, Barnegat and Great Egg Harbor inlets. In addition, so-called \u201ccross-bay barriers\u201d would have been erected in Absecon Bay near Atlantic City, and along a former railroad right of way along 52nd Street in Ocean City.",
      "These bay barriers would have had a swing gate in the middle that could be shut during major storms, and slat-like gates spanning about a third of a mile that would be lowered down into the water to block surges of water during storms. The structures would have risen about 20 feet (about 6.1 meters) over the water.",
      "The storm gates plan would have been one of the most ambitious and costly efforts any U.S. state has yet taken to address back bay flooding. This refers to floods that are not primarily caused by waves crashing over ocean barriers, but by stealthily rising water levels in bays along inland shorelines.",
      "Although ocean waves caused severe damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, back bay flooding also caused extensive damage in that storm. In numerous places, it was the primary source of property damage during Sandy.",
      "\u201cThe overwhelming cost probably had a lot to do with it,\u201d said Tim Dillingham, executive director of the American Littoral Society. \u201cThere's a growing awareness on the part of local officials that the maintenance of these projects falls to them. Maintaining miles of dikes and thousands of feet of gates is very expensive.\u201d",
      "But there are also environmental benefits to eliminating the barriers, Dillingham said, adding they would have interfered with water circulation in the shallow bays, potentially harming fish and wildlife.",
      "The new plan calls for elevating 6,421 homes by installing pilings underneath them. That figure is down from 19,000 in the original plan. Not all details are spelled out, but participants in an elevation plan would have to sign numerous permission forms to have their homes included in the government-funded work.",
      "It envisions flood-proofing 279 critical infrastructure facilities such as police, fire, and ambulance stations and hospitals.",
      "And it calls for using material dredged from the bottom of waterways to restore 217 acres (88 hectares) of salt marshes in seven locations deemed particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. These marshes would act as natural sponges capable of absorbing some of the floodwaters during severe storms.",
      "The latest version of the plan must still be finalized by the Army Corps, and Congress needs to approve funding for the work, which could take 11 years to complete.",

      "But commissioners said the vote created a pathway to lowering or eliminating reliance on Aliso Canyon in future years by establishing a target for the level of demand for natural gas in Southern California that can be met without the need of the facility.",
      "\u201cThis decision puts forward a path to the closure of Aliso Canyon that is achievable, realistic, and protective of families and businesses who are struggling to pay energy bills,\u201d CPUC President Alice Reynolds said in a statement. \u201cHuge progress is underway to bring online clean energy resources and drive down demand for natural gas-fired power plants.\"",
      "Opponents of the facility want it closed immediately. Craig Galanti, a Porter Ranch resident living near Aliso Canyon, was unhappy with the commission's vote.",
      "\u201cAm I surprised? No. Am I disappointed? I\u2019m exceedingly disappointed,\u201d he told the news group. \u201cThe CPUC continues to support the best interests of the utilities at the expense of the community\u2019s health and safety.\u201d",
      "The 2015 Aliso Canyon gas leak, which took four months to control, released more than 120,000 metric tons of methane and other gases into the atmosphere over communities in the San Fernando Valley.",
      "Thousands of residents were forced to move out of their homes to escape a sulfurous stench and maladies including headaches, nausea and nosebleeds. SoCalGas and its parent company, Sempra Energy, agreed to pay up to $1.8 billion in settlements to more than 35,000 victims in 2021.",
      "Last year, the company reached another settlement with the utilities commission, agreeing to pay more than $70 million to the Aliso Canyon Recovery Account to address the impacts from the leak on air quality and public health."

      "NEW YORK -- An Iranian officer blamed for the 2022 killing of an American in Iraq has been charged in New York with federal murder and terrorism crimes, authorities announced on Friday.",
      "Federal authorities in New York City said Mohammad Reza Nouri, a captain in Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, has been charged in Manhattan federal court with multiple terrorism and murder-related charges that carry a potential penalty of life in prison. At least one charge carries the potential for a death sentence.",
      "Nouri, 36, is in custody in Iraq, where he already has been convicted by an Iraqi court for his role in Stephen Troell\u2019s killing, authorities said.",
      "Troell, a native of Tennessee, was killed in his car by unknown assailants as he pulled up to the street where he lived with his family in Baghdad\u2019s central Karrada district. He worked for Global English Institute, a language school in Baghdad\u2019s Harthiya neighborhood, which operated under the auspices of Texas-based non-governmental organization Millennium Relief and Development Services.",
      "It was a rare killing of a foreigner in Iraq, where security conditions have improved in recent years.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim said in a release that Nouri orchestrated the killing of Troell in Baghdad, Iraq, in November 2022.",
      "\u201cNouri is alleged to have gathered intelligence on Troell\u2019s daily routine and whereabouts, procured weapons and vehicles, and provided safe harbor to the operatives who carried out the sinister plot to brutally attack Troell in front of his wife,\u201d Kim said.",
      "The prosecutor said the \u201cIranian regime is actively targeting U.S. citizens, such as Troell, living in countries around the world for kidnapping and execution both to repress and silence dissidents critical of the regime and to take vengeance\u201d for the death of Qassem Soleimani, an Iranian military leader killed by an American drone aircraft strike in January 2020.",
      "In court papers, the U.S. government asserted that Nouri celebrated the killing with a coconspirator on the day of the attack and left Iraq for Iran the night of the killing. It said shortly before leaving Baghdad, Nouri visited a religious site associated with mourning for Soleimani's death.",
      "Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in the release that the Justice Department \u201cwill not tolerate terrorists and authoritarian regimes targeting and murdering Americans anywhere in the world.\u201d",
      "Last month, the Justice Department disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill President-elect Donald Trump, saying a man had been tasked by an Iranian government official before the election with planning the assassination of the Republican president-elect.",
      "Esmail Baghaei, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson in Tehran, rejected the report, calling it a plot by Israel-linked circles to make Iran-U.S. relations more complicated, the official IRNA news agency reported.",
      "Similar accusations in the past were rejected by Iran as their \u201cerroneousness\u201d was proved, he said."

      "No state has a longer, more profit-driven history of contracting prisoners out to private companies than Alabama",
      "DADEVILLE, Ala. -- A storm was looming when the inmate serving 20 years for armed robbery was assigned to transport fellow prisoners to their jobs at private manufacturers supplying goods to companies like Home Depot and Wayfair. It didn\u2019t matter that Jake Jones once had escaped or that he had failed two drug and alcohol tests while in lockup \u2014 he was unsupervised and technically in charge.",
      "By the time Jones was driving back to the work release center with six other incarcerated workers, it was pelting rain. Jones had a reputation for driving fast and some of his passengers said he was racing along the country road, jamming to music in his earbuds. Suddenly, the transport van hit a dip and swerved on the wet pavement, slamming into a tree.",
      "Two men died after being thrown out of the van. And Jones, who was critically hurt and slumped over the blaring horn, had to be cut out of the vehicle. As the other men staggered into the storm to flag down help, they wondered: Why would the Alabama Department of Corrections place their lives in Jones\u2019 hands?",
      "\u201cThey knew he had a propensity to drink,\u201d said Shawn Wasden, who survived the crash. \u201cAnd they put him behind the wheel of a van anyway.\u201d",
      "No state has a longer, more profit-driven history of contracting prisoners out to private companies than Alabama. With a sprawling labor system that dates back more than 150 years \u2014 including the brutal convict leasing era that replaced slavery \u2014 it has constructed a template for the commercialization of mass incarceration.",
      "Best Western, Bama Budweiser and Burger King are among the more than 500 businesses to lease incarcerated workers from one of the most violent, overcrowded and unruly prison systems in the U.S. in the past five years alone, The Associated Press found as part of a two-year investigation into prison labor. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 through money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks.",
      "Most jobs are inside facilities, where the state\u2019s inmates \u2014 who are disproportionately Black \u2014 can be sentenced to hard labor and forced to work for free doing everything from mopping floors to laundry. But more than 10,000 inmates have logged a combined 17 million work hours outside Alabama\u2019s prison walls since 2018, for entities like city and county governments and businesses that range from major car-part manufacturers and meat-processing plants to distribution centers for major retailers like Walmart, the AP determined.",
      "While those working at private companies can at least earn a little money, they face possible punishment if they refuse, from being denied family visits to being sent to higher-security prisons, which are so dangerous that the federal government filed a lawsuit four years ago that remains pending, calling the treatment of prisoners unconstitutional.",
      "Though they make at least $7.25 an hour, the state siphons 40% off the top of all wages and also levies fees, including $5 a day for rides to their jobs and $15 a month for laundry.",
      "Turning down work can jeopardize chances of early release in a state that last year granted parole to only 8% of eligible prisoners \u2014 an all-time low, and among the worst rates nationwide \u2014 though that number more than doubled this year after public outcry.",
      "\u201cIt is a symptom of a completely, utterly broken system,\u201d said Chris England, an Alabama lawmaker pushing for criminal justice reform.",
      "Many prisoners work 40 hours a week outside their facilities and then get weekend passes, allowing them to go home without any supervision or electronic monitoring. So when prisoners are then told they\u2019re too dangerous to be permanently released, England said, it looks like \u201canother way to create a cheap labor force that is easily exploited and abused.\u201d",
      "Arthur Ptomey, who has worked at various private companies over the past six years, said he was denied parole in 2022 after losing his job at KFC, where he had complained about his low wages. A full-time cook, he was upset that even teenagers working the register were outearning him despite the fact that he had worked there for over a year.",
      "Ptomey is one of 10 current and former prisoners who filed a class-action federal lawsuit last year against state officials, local governments and businesses like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s franchises, contending they perpetuate a system of forced labor akin to a \u201cmodern-day form of slavery\u201d that keeps the best workers from being released.",
      "He currently works at Progressive Finishes, one of the state\u2019s biggest contractors of prison labor, which says on its website that it has served as a third-party supplier to automotive companies including Honda, General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Kia, Volvo, Chrysler and Hyundai.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of these jobs, the attitude is the same \u2026 if you don\u2019t meet our expectations, we\u2019ll just call for somebody else,\u201d Ptomey said while on a 48-hour home pass at his mother\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to come out and work, but I ain\u2019t come in here to be a slave.\u201d",
      "Kelly Betts of the corrections department defended the work programs, calling them crucial to the success of inmates preparing to leave prison. But she acknowledged that even those sentenced to life without the possibility of parole are eligible for so-called work release jobs.",
      "That\u2019s because in Alabama the department determines which prisoners are employed off site largely based on how well they\u2019ve behaved behind bars, instead of what put them there. Those working among the civilian population include men and women with records for violent crimes like murder and assault. Many are serving 15 years or longer.",
      "\u201cMany choose work to being confined to a facility all day,\u201d Betts said. \u201cIn many cases, it is a matter of quality of life. But ultimately, the inmate chooses and is not penalized for non-participation.\u201d",
      "Alabama\u2019s lockups are chronically understaffed, and it\u2019s not unusual for prisoners to work outside their facilities without any correctional oversight. And in some cases, there is no supervision of any kind, which has led to escapes, often referred to as \u201cwalkaways.\u201d",
      "Asked how prisoners are chosen to work without monitoring, Betts said, \u201cEach inmate\u2019s situation is unique, and each inmate is evaluated on his or her own record.\u201d",
      "Most companies did not respond to requests for comment, but the handful that did said they had no direct involvement with work release programs.",
      "Home Depot said it would investigate its connection to outdoor furniture maker Wadley Holdings, where some men in the van crash were working. It said it prohibits suppliers from using prison labor and would take action if policy violations are found.",
      "Best Western said it does not participate in personnel matters at its independently owned and operated hotels, and Hyundai said it knew some of its suppliers hired inmates for jobs but was not involved in the decision to do so. Honda said it was not aware of any business relationship with Progressive Finishes, which is common with companies and third-party suppliers.",
      "As part of its investigation, the AP analyzed 24 years of Alabama corrections department monthly statistical reports to calculate the amount of money generated via contracts with private companies and deductions taken out of prisoners\u2019 paychecks.",
      "Reporters also parsed information from more than 83,000 pages of data obtained through a public records request, including the names of inmates involved in Alabama\u2019s work programs. In addition to working for public entities \u2014 everywhere from landfills to the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 they were leased out to at least 500 private businesses between 2018 and mid-March 2024. That information was cross-referenced with an online state database, detailing the crimes that landed people in prison, their sentences, time served, race and good-time credits earned and revoked. The AP analysis faced limitations because some workplace entries were insufficiently defined.",
      "Few prisoner advocates believe outside jobs should be abolished. In Alabama, for instance, those shifts can offer a reprieve from the excessive violence inside the state\u2019s institutions. Last year, and in the first six months of 2024, an Alabama inmate died behind bars nearly every day, a rate five times the national average.",
      "But advocates say incarcerated workers should be paid fair wages, given the choice to work without threat of punishment, and granted the same workplace rights and protections guaranteed to other Americans.",
      "Prisoners nationwide cannot organize, protest or strike for better conditions. They also aren\u2019t typically classified as employees, whether they\u2019re working inside correctional facilities or for outside businesses through prison contracts or work release programs. And unless they are able to prove \u201cwillful negligence,\u201d it is almost impossible to successfully sue when incarcerated workers are hurt or killed.",
      "Though the Alabama corrections department said it could not provide information about the number of prisoners who died while on outside jobs, the AP tracked down family members of prisoners who lost their lives. One man was killed after being sucked into a machine at a plant operated by massive poultry processor Koch Foods and others died after being struck by vehicles while picking up trash or doing road maintenance on the side of busy highways.",
      "The day of the van accident, Jake Jones had finished his shift at a nearby Quality Inn, where his boss and co-workers told the AP that nothing seemed amiss. He headed to the Alexander City work center, where he was a go-to driver, and grabbed the keys to the white Ford Econoline so he could shuttle his fellow prisoners to their jobs. He had about four hours of driving ahead of him, zipping between a string of companies up to 40 minutes apart.",
      "Tyrone Heard, one of the passengers dropped off before the crash, said Jones had been drinking and that he believed staff knew it. Before heading out, he said he overheard two officers discussing whether they should find another driver.",
      "An hour into the trip, Heard said, Jones \u201ctold us he was drunk.\u201d At one point, he added, Jones smashed his foot on the gas until the speedometer topped 90 mph.",
      "About two hours later, the van was wrapped around the tree. Heard\u2019s uncle, Willie Crayton, was killed instantly. Bruce Clements struggled to breathe and died on the way to the hospital.",
      "The accident report estimated the van\u2019s speed was 67 mph upon impact \u2014 more than 20 mph over the speed limit. Blood tests were conducted to determine if drugs or alcohol were in the driver\u2019s system, but those results have never been released. Police, volunteer firefighters and emergency medical responders would not comment, saying the case remained under investigation.",
      "Betts, the corrections department spokeswoman, said Jones met all the criteria to be an inmate driver: Though he failed drug and alcohol tests in 2018 and 2022 \u2014 and another about a month after the accident \u2014 he passed his screening test two days before the deadly crash.",
      "And prison guidelines only bar participation of prisoners who escaped or were recaptured within a 10-year period. His escape was in 2010.",
      "Jones, who since has been moved to a higher-security facility, did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "Some of the men involved in the crash have been released from prison after serving their sentences, but others continue to report to outside jobs.",
      "They still ride past the crash site, marked by a simple cross \u2014 with Willie Crayton\u2019s hat resting on top.",
      "Prison labor is enshrined in the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which banned slavery and involuntary servitude \u2013 except for those convicted of a crime. That language also was added to the constitutions of many states, though eight of them have removed the so-called punishment clause in recent years after taking the issue to voters.",
      "In 2022, Alabama became one of them, but Gov. Kay Ivey signed an executive order last year giving the corrections department the authority to revoke good-time credits \u2014 days shaved off sentences rewarding model behavior \u2014 for \u201crefusing to work,\u201d making it harder for even the best prisoners to accelerate their release.",
      "\u201cThe people just say that they thought it was unconstitutional, inhumane \u2026 and you come back and say, \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019\u201d said Robert Earl Council, who is part of the federal lawsuit filed last year against forced labor in prison. \u201cIt verifies clearly to me the point that we\u2019ve been trying to drive home \u2026 this is strictly, explicitly about the money.\u201d",
      "Council, also known as Kinetic Justice, spent five years in solitary confinement for helping lead prison work stoppages \u2014 including one that spread to facilities in several other states. At one point, he and other inmates also began hunger strikes, demanding an end to free labor.",
      "Throughout the state\u2019s history of prison labor, money has been a key driver.",
      "Soon after the Civil War, when the South\u2019s once-booming economy was in tatters, Alabama turned to convict leasing. Young, mostly Black men were arrested for petty crimes like gambling or vagrancy and hired out to private companies. They were forced to build railroads, work in sawmills and toil under deplorable conditions in coal mines, including those owned by U.S. Steel \u2014 the biggest company in the world at the time.",
      "No state in America earned more from convict leasing than Alabama \u2014 at one point, it accounted for more than 70% of all annual revenue. It was also where companies made the most money. By the time Alabama became the last state to officially ban the practice in 1928, thousands of prisoners had died from rampant disease, dangerous working conditions and poor treatment. Incarcerated workers were treated as disposable, reflected in a quote at the time: \u201cOne dies, get another.\u201d",
      "Alabama shifted its strategy when industries began to modernize and mechanize, said Douglas Blackmon, whose book \u201cSlavery by Another Name\u201d chronicles the state\u2019s dark past of convict leasing.",
      "\u201cUp until that moment, the practices were so profitable for both government officials and industry \u2026 that they would always find a way to continue the system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that people have figured out how to make a lot of money on again. And so the practice reemerges.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to the 1970s, when conditions were so bad \u2014 from abysmal treatment of inmates with mental illnesses to extreme violence \u2014 that a U.S. federal judge took control of Alabama\u2019s entire prison system.",
      "That\u2019s when the Department of Corrections decided to classify inmates largely by their behavior behind bars rather than their criminal histories, ostensibly to help alleviate overcrowding. Under the new standards, eligible participants would not only get paid for their outside jobs, but also have their sentences reduced for every day worked.",
      "The system was adopted over the objections of Oscar Adams, the state\u2019s first Black Supreme Court justice, who noted that the vast majority of those accepted would not get \u201cgood time\u201d because prisoners sentenced to more than 10 years \u2014 later pushed to 15 \u2014 were ineligible. At the time, they represented the bulk of the prison population.",
      "That population continued to grow, mostly due to historically harsh sentencing laws that put people away for life, even if they were convicted of nonviolent crimes. And so did its workforce.",
      "Today, the state has a patchwork of programs that includes not just work centers \u2014 including jobs for the city and state paying $2 a day \u2014 but also work release programs operated at the county level, sometimes by nonprofit organizations. They receive about $10 a day for every person they house, plus hefty fees paid by prisoners for things like mandatory drug testing.",
      "Some see the largely autonomous county programs as exploitative, but others call them a lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt taught me how to be a man,\u201d said Matthew Smith, who has a history of drug addiction and worked at a poultry plant through a community corrections work release program. \u201cIt taught me how to get up and go to work every day.\u201d",
      "Even prisoners who are happy working often complain about the steep pre-tax deductions taken by the state. After a 40-hour week, many say they end up pocketing only about $100 to $200.",
      "But for the hundreds of private companies that hire them, the benefits are robust. Businesses pay at least minimum wage, but can earn up to $2,400 in tax credits for some inmates hired. Amid crushing staff shortages, they can rely on a steady, pliable workforce available to take extra shifts, fill in at the last minute when civilian workers call in sick and also work holidays. And if an incarcerated worker is injured or even killed on the job, the company may not be liable.",
      "The same is true for businesses across the country. As part of its larger investigation, the AP spoke to more than 120 current and former prisoners and relatives of those who died on the job. Reporters found that the use of incarcerated workers is so pervasive nationwide that prison labor has seeped into the supply chains of some of the country\u2019s largest companies and retailers \u2014 and also goods being exported.",
      "Trader Joe\u2019s, Cargill, McDonald\u2019s and other companies responded to that reporting earlier this year by either cutting ties with correctional departments or third-party suppliers or indicating they were in the process of doing so.",
      "In Alabama, the roster of companies hiring inmates is vast.",
      "In the past five years, over 500 prisoners have worked at local Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Applebee\u2019s restaurants alone. They also have cleaned hotels, manufactured kitchen cabinets, made yarn used in carpets, constructed doors for houses sold at national home stores like Lowe\u2019s, and built trailers pulled behind semi trucks. They\u2019ve helped keep cities running across the state, and worked at public country clubs and even the Supreme Court.",
      "Alabama collected more than $13 million in work release fees in fiscal year 2024. But the prisoner lawsuit filed in federal court late last year with backing from the powerful AFL-CIO federation of unions, estimates the corrections department actually rakes in about $450 million in benefits from prison labor annually. That takes into consideration money saved by not having to hire civilians to maintain the sprawling prison system or work for government agencies.",
      "The suit also alleges that prisoners participating in work programs with good disciplinary records have been hardest hit by plummeting parole rates, with Black workers disproportionately affected.",
      "A decade ago, nearly half the prisoners coming up for parole were released, with no clear racial disparity, it noted. But that changed several years ago when the board began disregarding its own guidelines and denying early releases to those who scored high enough to qualify, based on criteria like their crimes, perceived risk to society and behavior behind bars. In fiscal year 2023, there were 3,583 parole hearings that resulted in 3,286 denials \u2014 including one involving a man who had been dead for 10 days.",
      "Alabama\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. But in successfully moving for dismissal of a similar state lawsuit filed by inmates last year, it said \u201cslavery and involuntary servitude do not exist in the state\u2019s prison system.\u201d",
      "Those who take part in work release programs do so voluntarily, the motion noted.",
      "For members of the public buying a Blizzard at Dairy Queen or having their cars worked on in a local garage, it can be hard to distinguish incarcerated employees from their civilian counterparts. In most cases, they dress in the same clothes or uniforms. And even those clearly identified as prisoners doing more traditional jobs like road work go unnoticed by most busy motorists speeding down the state\u2019s roads.",
      "That was true of Braxton Moon, his mother said. He told her how terrified he was by how dangerously close cars whizzed past him, even as he held a sign warning drivers to slow down.",
      "Angela Lindsey pleaded with her son to quit \u2014 he was making only $2 a day. But he told her that working beat being locked up around the clock.",
      "Two weeks later, in August 2015, Lindsey received a phone call from her cousin asking: \u201c\u2018Is it true?\u2019\u201d An officer at the work center had posted a picture of her son on Facebook with the words \u201cRest in peace.\u201d",
      "She frantically called the center over and over, only to be hung up on each time. \u201cAll of this was before I even got anything \u2014 anything \u2014 from the state,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was on social media. It was on the news.\u201d",
      "And then it was confirmed: Her son had been struck by a tractor-trailer in a hit and run along the side of Interstate 65.",
      "He had died instantly. He was just 21.",

    "story": [
      "The military has ordered new safety guidelines for a key part in all Osprey aircraft after a recent accident revealed the same problem that had caused a fatal crash in Japan last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- The military has ordered new safety guidelines for a key part in all Osprey aircraft after a recent accident revealed the same problem that caused a fatal crash in Japan last year.",
      "During a Nov. 20 flight involving a CV-22B Osprey in New Mexico, the crew received warnings that the metal gears inside the aircraft's transmission, known as the proprotor gearbox, were in trouble.",
      "They lost an engine, but due to lessons learned from the crash in Japan that killed eight service members, the Air Force Special Operations Command crew in New Mexico quickly got the aircraft on the ground and survived.",
      "Investigators opened up the failed and badly damaged transmission from last month's flight, finding the same type of metal weaknesses \u2014 called inclusions \u2014 that led to gears breaking apart in a similar way in the Japan crash in November 2023.",
      "Following the New Mexico near-crash, all the military services grounded their Ospreys, which can fly both like a helicopter and an airplane, for the second time this year. The Marines, however, put their Ospreys back in the air days later.",
      "Under guidelines announced Friday, all Ospreys with proprotor gearboxes under a certain number of flight hours will be subject to additional safety restrictions. The restrictions affect the newer transmissions because investigators have found that the metal weaknesses, if they are going to occur, happen early on.",
      "The metal weaknesses have been tied to the way the alloys are manufactured. There is a hardier manufacturing method available, but it will require replacement of the expensive transmissions, a process that likely would take years to complete for all of the approximately 400 aircraft in the military's fleet.",

      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats, recently hailed as a model of electoral and legislative success, are ending their final days in complete control of the state government mired by divisions and outright rebellion that has stalled votes on key priorities.",
      "Tensions peaked Thursday as the state House\u2019s top Democrat ordered absent members back and barred the doors, only to reverse course and end the year\u2019s legislative session. The chaos erupted after a Democrat joined Republicans in skipping, leaving the chamber without enough members to hold votes.",
      "\u201cEverything that was on the agenda today in the House is dead,\u201d House Speaker Pro Tem Laurie Pohutsky told reporters Thursday. \u201cAnd the 55 members that did not attend should feel free to own it.\u201d",
      "The turmoil and finger-pointing in the final days of the legislative session underscore deep divisions within the Democratic Party on how to move forward after significant setbacks in the November general election.",

      "Two Black Democrats were critical to the stoppage this week, saying they had lost faith in the party\u2019s attention to Black voter needs.",
      "\u201cI think that if those needs were prioritized, then we would not have seen what happened Nov. 6,\u201d said state Sen. Sylvia Santana, who boycotted the Senate session on Wednesday.",
      "Democratic Detroit state Rep. Karen Whitsett, who skipped session both Wednesday and Thursday, appeared with Republican Minority Leader Matt Hall on Thursday and took shots at Democratic leadership, a sign of the growing unrest toward and within the party\u2019s leadership.",
      "Earlier this month, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, announced he was running for governor in 2026 as an independent, in part, due to a \u201cpartisan, toxic atmosphere we\u2019ve got.\u201d",
      "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat in her second term, had also told leaders from both parties that they should not expect her to sign any bills until her priorities are first addressed. Whitmer wants increased funding for economic development projects and road repairs, according to a source who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "And in a statement Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks said she is \u201cdeeply disappointed that the House of Representatives called it quits.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018Frustrated\u2019 is too light of a word to describe my dismay that the House failed to meet its obligations in this historic moment,\u201d said Brinks, a Grand Rapids Democrat.",
      "Pohutsky said the House is adjourned until Dec. 31, when the session is expected to formally end, effectively killing bills to expand public records requests to the governor\u2019s office, ban ghost guns and protect reproductive health data.",
      "Democratic House leadership consistently denied division in the party and blamed the Republicans who were absent.",
      "\u201cThe bare minimum they can do is show up,\u201d Pohutsky told reporters before the House adjourned. \u201cAnd I would say vote, but that\u2019s between them and their constituents.\u201d",
      "Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement Wednesday that Whitsett's and House Republicans' absences were \u201ccriminal,\u201d which drew swift blowback from both sides of the aisle.",
      "House Republicans walked out of session Dec. 13, saying they would not vote on anything unless it\u2019s funding for roads and legislation that would address new minimum wage and paid sick leave requirements. The caucus remained absent from the floor Wednesday and Thursday.",
      "Republicans are set to regain control of the Michigan House in January, ending nearly two years of full Democratic legislative power.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to communicate with the other side. We\u2019re going to treat them fairly,\u201d said Hall, the incoming House majority leader. \u201cIf we treat the members of the other party with respect, we\u2019ll never get in this situation, and that\u2019s what we intend to do next year.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- The first U.S. diplomats to visit Syria since President Bashar Assad\u2019s ouster earlier this month are now in Damascus to hold talks with the country\u2019s new leaders and seek information on the whereabouts of missing American journalist Austin Tice.",
      "Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf, former special envoy for Syria Daniel Rubinstein and the Biden administration\u2019s chief envoy for hostage negotiations, Roger Carstens, made the trip for talks with Syria\u2019s interim leaders, the State Department said early Friday.",
      "The team is also the first group of American diplomats to formally visit Syria in more than a decade since the U.S. shuttered its embassy in Damascus in 2012.",
      "\u201cThey will be engaging directly with the Syrian people, including members of civil society, activists, members of different communities, and other Syrian voices about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,\u201d the State Department said.",
      "At the top of their agenda will be information about Tice, who went missing in Syria in 2012. And they will push the principles of inclusion, protection of minorities and a rejection of terrorism and chemical weapons that the Biden administration says will be critical for any U.S. support for a new government.",
      "The U.S. has redoubled efforts to find Tice and return him home, saying officials have communicated with the rebels who ousted Assad's government about the American journalist. Carstens traveled previously to Lebanon to seek information.",
      "Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus as the Syrian civil war intensified.",
      "A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, \u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d He has not been heard from since. Assad's government publicly denied that it was holding him.",
      "The rebel group that spearheaded the assault on Damascus that forced Assad to flee \u2014 Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2014 is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. While that designation comes with a raft of sanctions, it does not prohibit U.S. officials from speaking to its members or leaders.",
      "The State Department said Rubinstein, Leaf and Carstens would meet with HTS officials but did not say if the group's leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, would be among those they see.",
      "U.S. officials say al-Sharaa\u2019s public statements about protecting minority and women\u2019s rights are welcomed, but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run.",
      "The U.S. has not had a formal diplomatic presence in Syria since 2012, when it suspended operations at its embassy in Damascus during the country\u2019s civil war, although there are U.S. troops in small parts of Syria engaged in the fight against the Islamic State militant group.",
      "The Pentagon revealed Thursday that the U.S. had doubled the number of its forces in Syria to fight IS before Assad\u2019s fall. The U.S. also has significantly stepped up airstrikes against IS targets over concern that a power vacuum would allow the militant group to reconstitute itself.",
      "The diplomats' visit to Damascus will not result in the immediate reopening of the U.S. embassy, which is under the protection of the Czech government, according to U.S. officials, who said decisions on diplomatic recognition will be made when the new Syrian authorities make their intentions clear."

      "An Indiana man convicted in the 2017 killings of two teenage girls who vanished during a winter hike will face up to 130 years in prison when a judge sentences him Friday",
      "DELPHI, Ind. -- An Indiana man convicted in the 2017 killings of two teenage girls who vanished during a winter hike will face up to 130 years in prison when he's sentenced Friday in the case that's long cast a shadow over the teens' small hometown of Delphi.",
      "After a weekslong trial, Richard Allen was convicted on Nov. 11 in the killings of Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14. A jury found him guilty of two counts of murder and two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.",
      "Allen faces between 45 years and 130 years in prison for the killings of the Delphi teens, known as Abby and Libby. He will be sentenced on two of the four murder counts.",
      "Allen, 52, also lived in Delphi. When he was arrested in October 2022, more than five years after the February 2017 killings, he was employed as a pharmacy technician at a pharmacy only blocks from the county courthouse where he later stood trial.",
      "Allen's trial came after repeated delays, a leak of evidence, the withdrawal of his public defenders and their reinstatement by the Indiana Supreme Court.",
      "The case, which included tantalizing evidence, has long drawn outsized attention from true-crime enthusiasts.",
      "Allen will be sentenced Friday by the special judge who oversaw the case, Allen County Superior Court Judge Fran Gull. Relatives of German and Williams may address the court during the hearing, which Gull has scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.",
      "Allen's attorneys said in a sentencing memorandum that even in \u201cthe unlikely scenario\u201d that Gull sentences their client to 45 years on each of two murder counts, and orders those sentences served concurrently, their client's minimum possible 45-year sentence with good time credit would \u201camount to 33.75 actual years in prison.\u201d",
      "\u201cRichard Allen is likely facing the rest of his life in prison. Even on his best day at sentencing Richard will be 85 years old upon his release,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Gull and the jurors came from northeastern Indiana\u2019s Allen County. The jury's seven women and five men were sequestered throughout the trial, which began Oct. 18 in the Carroll County seat of Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown of about 3,000 residents some 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Indianapolis.",
      "A relative dropped the teens off at a hiking trail just outside Delphi on Feb. 13, 2017. The eighth graders didn't arrive at the agreed pickup location and were reported missing that evening. Their bodies were found the next day with their throats cut in a wooded area near an abandoned railroad trestle they had crossed.",
      "In his closing arguments, Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland told jurors that Allen, armed with a gun, forced the youths off the hiking trail and had planned to rape them before a passing van made him change his plans and he cut their throats. McLeland said an unspent bullet found between the teens\u2019 bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d Allen\u2019s .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun.",
      "An Indiana State Police firearms expert told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s handgun.",
      "McLeland said Allen was the man seen following the teens across the Monon High Bridge in a grainy cellphone video German had recorded. And he said it was Allen\u2019s voice that could be heard on that video telling the teens, \u201c Down the hill \u2033 after they crossed the bridge.",
      "\u201cRichard Allen is Bridge Guy,\u201d McLeland told jurors. \u201cHe kidnapped them and later murdered them.\u201d",
      "McLeland also noted that Allen had repeatedly confessed to the killings \u2014 in person, on the phone and in writing. In one of the recordings he replayed for the jury, Allen could be heard telling his wife, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "Allen\u2019s defense argued that his confessions were unreliable because he was facing a severe mental health crisis while under the pressure and stress of being locked up in isolation, watched 24 hours a day and taunted by people incarcerated with him. A psychiatrist called by the defense testified that months in solitary confinement could make a person delirious and psychotic.",
      "Defense attorney Bradley Rozzi said in his closing arguments that Allen was innocent. He said no witness explicitly identified Allen as the man seen on the hiking trail or the bridge the afternoon the girls went missing. He also said no fingerprint, DNA or forensic evidence links Allen to the murder scene.",
      "\u201cHe had every chance to run, but he did not because he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Rozzi told the jury.",
      "Allen\u2019s lawyers had sought to argue during the trial that the girls were killed in a ritual sacrifice by members of a white nationalist group known as the Odinists who follow a pagan Norse religion. The judge, however, ruled against that, saying the defense \u201cfailed to produce admissible evidence\u201d of such a connection.",
      "Gull's long-running gag order in the case is expected to be lifted after Allen is sentenced, Indiana State Police spokesperson Capt. Ron Galaviz said Wednesday. Law enforcement, prosecutors and relatives of the teens plan to speak at a news conference shortly after Friday\u2019s hearing ends."

      "Some U.S. colleges and universities are advising international students to return to campus before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- A growing number of U.S. colleges and universities are advising international students to return to campus before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, over concerns that he might impose travel bans like he did during his first administration.",
      "More than a dozen schools have issued advisories, even though Trump\u2019s plans remain uncertain. At some schools, the spring semester begins before Trump will take office, so students may have to be back in class anyway. But for anyone whose ability to stay in the United States depends on an academic visa, they say it's best to reduce their risks and get back to campus before Jan. 20.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what Trump has said and done and how schools and students are preparing for his second term:",
      "Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on their flights or detained at U.S. airports after they landed. They included students and faculty as well as business people, tourists and visitors to friends and family.",
      "Trump later removed some countries and added others to the list \u2014 15 nations were affected at some point during his presidency. More than 40,000 people were ultimately refused visas because of the ban, according to the U.S. State Department. President Joe Biden rescinded the orders when he took office in 2021.",
      "More than 1.1 million international students were enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities during the 2023-24 school year, according to Open Doors, a data project partially funded by the U.S. State Department. Students from India and China have accounted for more than half of all international students in the U.S., and about 43,800 come from the 15 countries affected by Trump\u2019s travel restrictions.",
      "Jacky Li, a third-year environmental studies major at University of California, Berkeley, will be traveling home to China Dec. 21 and returning Jan. 16. Though he made his plans months before Berkeley officials sent the advisory, he said worry is growing among international students.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fear that this kind of restriction will enlarge into a wider community, considering the geopolitical tensions nowadays around the world, so the fear is definitely there,\u201d said Li, who urged Trump to support, rather than thwart, important academic research.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is really a champion of academic freedom, what you should do is not restrict this kind of communications between different countries of the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to questions on the topic this week, but in the past he has said he\u2019ll revive the travel ban and expand it, pledging new \u201cideological screening\u201d for non-U.S. citizens to bar \u201cdangerous lunatics, haters, bigots and maniacs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe aren\u2019t bringing in anyone from Gaza, Syria, Somalia, Yemen or Libya or anywhere else that threatens our security,\u201d Trump said at an October 2023 campaign event in Iowa.",
      "Trump also vowed to \u201crevoke the student visas of radical anti-American and anti-Semitic foreigners at our colleges and universities\u201d in response to campus protests.",
      "School officials have advised international students heading home for winter break to return before Inauguration Day and to prepare for possible delays at immigration control.",
      "The list includes Ivy League universities such as Harvard and Brown, Boston schools such as Northeastern University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and other schools around the country, from Johns Hopkins University to the University of Southern California. Some offer classes that begin the day after Inauguration Day.",
      "Cornell University told its students that a travel ban involving the 13 nations Trump previously targeted \u201cis likely to go into effect soon after inauguration,\u201d and that new countries could be added to the list, particularly China and India. It advised students, faculty and staff from those countries to return to campus before the semester starts Jan. 21.",
      "Other schools didn\u2019t go so far as to say a ban is likely but instead advised students to plan ahead and prepare for delays."

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas\u2019 attorney general sought again on Thursday to stop a man on death row from testifying to lawmakers who have raised doubts about his guilt and successfully paused his execution at the last minute in October.",
      "Robert Roberson was convicted in 2003 of killing his 2-year-old daughter. His execution had been set to be the first in the U.S. over a conviction tied to shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis some medical experts have questioned.",
      "A Texas House panel had again subpoenaed Roberson to appear before lawmakers Friday, which would require a transport from his prison outside Houston.",
      "Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said his office asked a court for an order blocking the subpoena, which he said automatically prevents Roberson from appearing while the legal challenge is pending. A spokesperson for Democratic Rep. Joe Moody, chair of the Texas House committee that subpoenaed Roberson, did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment Thursday.",
      "Paxton has defended Roberson's conviction and sharply criticized lawmakers who delayed his execution.",
      "\u201cIt has expressly\u2014and repeatedly\u2014stated its purpose for wanting Roberson\u2019s testimony: It wants to relitigate the facts of his case because the Committee believes Roberson is innocent and obtain for him a new trial,\u201d Paxton's office told the court.",
      "A new execution date for Roberson has not been set.",
      "Roberson, 58, was sentenced to death in 2003 for killing his daughter, Nikki Curtis. Prosecutors said Roberson shook her violently back and forth. Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued the girl\u2019s symptoms did not align with child abuse and that she likely died from complications from severe pneumonia.",
      "Roberson has gained bipartisan support from lawmakers and medical experts who say he was convicted on faulty evidence of shaken baby syndrome, which refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact.",
      "The Texas House committee has argued it needs to hear from Roberson about whether a 2013 law created to allow prisoners to challenge their convictions based on new scientific evidence was ignored in his case.",
      "The House committee used an unconventional strategy to delay his execution: issuing a subpoena for Roberson to testify days after he was scheduled to die. After legal debate in multiple courts, the Texas Supreme Court upheld an order to stay Roberson\u2019s execution.",
      "In November, the Supreme Court ruled that a legislative subpoena cannot stop an execution. The court said the committee could issue another subpoena for Roberson\u2019s testimony so long as it didn\u2019t block a scheduled execution.",
      "The committee and Roberson\u2019s lawyers want him to appear in person, saying testimony by videoconference would be difficult for him because he has been diagnosed with autism and has communication challenges.",

      "The man later was identified as John Lyons, 24, of Westchester, west of Chicago.",
      "Police said he was suspected in the fatal shootings of three people in Mahomet, about 120 miles (190 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. One of the victims died at the scene where the three were found about 9:40 p.m. Wednesday. The other two were pronounced dead at a nearby hospital."

      "Activists have sued the federal government to release images of dead orca whales and other marine mammals entangled by commercial fishing boats off the U.S. West Coast",
      "MIAMI -- Activists sued the federal government Thursday to release images of dead orca whales, sea lions and other marine mammals entangled by commercial fishing boats off the U.S. West Coast.",
      "The complaints were filed after the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration failed to fulfill multiple Freedom of Information Act requests filed by Oceana, a Washington-based conservation group, as part of its campaign to raise public awareness about the harmful effects of trawl fishing in federally-managed waters.",
      "\u201dPeople have the right to know how commercial fisheries impact marine wildlife,\" Tara Brock, Oceana\u2019s Pacific legal director, said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuits were filed Thursday in federal courts in Alaska and California by attorneys from San Francisco-based Earthjustice on behalf of Oceana.",
      "At the heart of the legal challenge is NOAA's sometimes conflicting dual mandate: to promote fishing to its maximum sustainable level while also enforcing laws to protect marine mammals.",
      "Oceana has long campaigned for tighter controls of trawl fishing, one of the least sustainable fishing methods, in which large boats drag enormous nets on or near the ocean floor, collecting huge amounts of unintentional bycatch. The lawsuit cites high \u2014and sometimes rising \u2014 levels of animal entanglements in U.S. waters. During one four-month period alone last year, 10 orca whales were entangled in the Bering Sea off Alaska, according to NOAA data. All but one were dead.",
      "Oceana, starting in 2021, submitted requests for public records to seek photos and video records of the mortalities taken by taxpayer-funded observers placed on vessels to assure compliance with federal conservation mandates.",
      "NOAA refused to provide any of the records of marine mammal bycatch from the halibut fishery off California. In the case of Alaska, it released a few unredacted images but the majority were heavily redacted and pixelated, some to the point that it is impossible to identify the animal shown, Oceana said.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency can't comment on litigation.",
      "But in the lawsuit Oceana states that it was told by NOAA the release of unredacted images would violate provisions of the Magnuson Stevens Act, the main legislation regulating fisheries, requiring it to protect the identities of specific vessels and businesses.",
      "Oceana, in the lawsuit, argues that the Magnuson Stevens Act \u201cis built on the principle that the public must be able to participate meaningfully in fisheries management\" and that NOAA's denial of its records request unlawfully squashes scrutiny of commercial fishing practices.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy\u2019s wish list for the incoming Trump administration includes oil and gas exploration in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reversing restrictions on logging and road-building in a temperate rainforest that provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon.",
      "Dunleavy has asked President-elect Donald Trump to issue a state-specific executive order that would set in motion \u201ccritical agency actions that would restore opportunity to Alaska\" in line with Trump's first administration. Dunleavy and other Republican political leaders in the state have expressed excitement about Trump's return to the White House and believe he will be more friendly to oil and gas, mineral and other resource development than President Joe Biden.",
      "Alaska has a long history of fighting what it sees as federal overreach, particularly when it comes to decisions that hinder development of the state\u2019s vast resources.",
      "Dunleavy outlined his requests in a letter to Trump dated Nov. 15 and publicly released this week. He is also asking Trump to create a Cabinet-level task force that would have the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies work together on Trump\u2019s Alaska-specific policy goals.",
      "The direction taken on some of the issues raised by Dunleavy has shifted dramatically from one federal administration to the next, with the policy calls often winding up in court. The debate over protections for the country\u2019s largest national forest, the Tongass in southeast Alaska, for example, has ping-ponged back and forth since the Clinton administration.",
      "Bridget Psarianos, staff attorney with Trustees for Alaska \u2014 which has been involved in litigation aimed at protecting places like the refuge \u2014 said many of the issues on Dunleavy's list are ones her group has worked on for decades, \u201cand I think we're just getting prepared to continue to hold the line.\u201d",
      "Her group will scrutinize \u201cany and all attempts to cut corners and expedite\u201d projects, including drilling in the refuge, she said.",
      "Trustees for Alaska also has been involved in a lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's approval of the large Willow oil project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.",
      "While Willow might be seen as one of the areas where Biden and Dunleavy agree, the current federal administration paired its 2023 approval of the project with plans for restrictions on drilling activity in other parts of the petroleum reserve, which Dunleavy called disgraceful.",
      "Biden as a candidate opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. After taking office he ordered a review of the leasing program \u2014 just weeks after the first lease sale there was held under Trump. Seven leases from that sale were later canceled.",
      "A 2017 law that's been touted by Trump called for offering two lease sales in the refuge's coastal plain by late 2024. The second such sale \u2014 announced earlier this month \u2014 is set for Jan. 9, less than two weeks before Biden leaves office. It will include a fraction of the total amount of land that was available for bidding in the first sale and has been condemned as paltry and a mockery of the law by Dunleavy and the state's Republican U.S. senators.",
      "Dunleavy, in an interview with The Associated Press last month, said he considers the concept of an energy transition from fossil fuels \u201cpretty much dead \u2014 meaning, demand for energy is growing so exponentially, there\u2019s very few experts that believe it can get there without fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally would love to see the whole renewable world continue to expand, and I would love to see the oil and gas world, and coal, expand, especially if we can capture that carbon,\u201d he said.",
      "He has billed carbon offset and underground storage programs as a way for Alaska to diversify its revenues while continuing to develop resources such as oil and gas, coal and timber and not impose new taxes."

      "A spokesperson for the secretary of state\u2019s office said they were evaluating the ruling.",

      "Fontes had argued that the strict deadline he must follow to submit the state's election results justified the rule. Blaney agreed a tight deadline must be adhered to but said doing so doesn't justify excluding a county's election results.",
      "\u201cNothing in the statutes permits the Secretary to exclude a particular county\u2019s canvass and/or, by extension, disenfranchise the entirety of the county\u2019s voters,\u201d Blaney wrote. \u201cThe Secretary does not have the authority to read such a drastic course of action into the governing statutes.\u201d",
      "In the lawsuit they filed on behalf of the Legislature, Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen and House Speaker Ben Toma, both Republicans, accused Fontes, a Democrat, of overstepping his authority by updating rules in the manual.

      "ICE, the main government agency responsible for removing people in the country illegally, had 271,484 deportations in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, nearly double from 142,580 in the same period a year earlier.",
      "It was ICE's highest deportation count since 2014, when it removed 315,943 people. The highest it reached during Trump's first term in the White House was 267,258 in 2019.",
      "Increased deportation flights, including on weekends, and streamlined travel procedures for people sent to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador fueled the increase, ICE said. The agency had its first large flight to China in six years and also had planes stop in Albania, Angola, Egypt, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Mauritania, Romania, Senegal, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.",
      "Also Thursday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said authorities made 46,612 arrests for crossing the border illegally from Mexico in November, down 18% from 56,526 a month earlier and more than 80% from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023. Arrests fell by half when Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders a year ago and by half again when President Joe Biden introduced severe asylum restrictions in June. The November numbers were the lowest since July 2020 and indicate that a widely anticipated spike after Trump was elected president didn't happen immediately.",
      "Over the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, Mexico was the most common destination for deportees (87,298), followed by Guatemala (66,435) and Honduras (45,923), the ICE report said. Mexico and Central American countries are expected to continue to bear the brunt of deportations, partly because those governments more readily accept their respective citizens than some others and logistics are easier.",
      "Still, ICE's detention space and staff limited its reach as the number of people it monitors through immigration courts continued to mushroom. The agency's enforcement and removals unit has remained steady at around 6,000 officers over the last decade while its caseload has roughly quadrupled to 7.6 million, up from 6.1 million in the last year alone.",
      "ICE detained an average of 37,700 people a day over the recent 12-month period, a number determined by congressional funding. With detention space a potential hurdle for mass deportations, the state of Texas is offering rural land as a staging area.",
      "ICE made 113,431 arrests during the latest period, down 34% from 170,590 a year earlier. The agency said a need to focus resources on the border with Mexico diverted attention from making arrests in the country's interior.",

      "Kentucky's attorney general says the state is under no legal requirement to use taxpayer money to cover the costs of gender-affirming surgeries for people incarcerated in state prisons",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky is under no legal requirement to use taxpayer money to cover the costs of gender-affirming surgeries for people incarcerated in state prisons, Attorney General Russell Coleman said Thursday.",
      "The state's corrections department requested the opinion from the state's Republican attorney general as the agency amends its administrative regulations regarding medical care for people in prison.",
      "Coleman was asked whether the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment means the department is required to pay for gender-affirming surgeries for transgender people in prison when the procedure is deemed \u201cmedical necessary\u201d by medical professionals.",
      "\u201cCommon sense dictates that it is not \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 for the department to decline to spend taxpayer dollars on such controversial medical procedures,\" Coleman's opinion said. \"Fortunately, there is no controlling legal authority that compels the department to abandon common sense.\u201d",
      "Coleman said the opinion should settle the question \"once and for all.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea that Kentucky taxpayers should be forced to pay for gender surgeries for convicted criminals was simply absurd,\" he said.",
      "The issue surfaced at a recent legislative committee meeting as the corrections department attempts to update rules to broaden accommodations for transgender people in prison to comply with federal standards. The department's efforts drew a backlash from some Republicans in the GOP-supermajority Legislature.",
      "The department's proposed new rules would expand protections for transgender people in prison by ensuring they have access to appropriate medical and mental health services and are housed in facilities that align with their gender identity, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. If gender-affirming care is requested, the changes set out a protocol that includes extensive mental health evaluations and, potentially, medical interventions.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he appreciated the attorney general's response and said the proposed regulation would be redrafted to reflect the opinion from Coleman's office.",
      "Beshear, a Democrat who is seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said LGBTQ+ people in prison can face greater risks of violence while incarcerated and can have different health care needs.",
      "Earlier this year, a transgender woman who was assaulted by an incarcerated man while housed in a men\u2019s unit at an Arizona penitentiary won a $10,000 judgment in a federal civil rights lawsuit.",
      "Federal law requires safety procedures as well as medical coverage for LGBTQ+ people in prison, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cBut like medical coverage for any inmate, it has its limits,\" Beshear told reporters. \"In the end, we look at what\u2019s reasonable. And I think what is reasonable is, in any circumstance, an inmate regardless of their gender identity should not have better access to health care than a law-abiding private citizen.\u201d",
      "Kentucky has to balance providing health care for people in prison while respecting taxpayers, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt does appear that federal law requires some level of care, just not those surgeries,\" he said. \u201cSo I believe you will see in the regulation certain care that is provided to various populations including the transgender population. It would be unconstitutional and it would be wrong to provide no specialized care at all. So we\u2019re going to try to find that right balance.\u201d",
      "The Kentucky Republican Party criticized Beshear for his administration's handling of the issue.",
      "\"As governor, he is responsible for policies and regulations that are put in place by his administration. He\u2019s either leading this administration or he\u2019s not,\u201d state GOP communications director Andy Westberry said in a statement.",
      "Kentucky is among many states that have taken steps to restrict or ban transgender care. In 2023, Kentucky lawmakers banned access to gender-affirming health care for transgender young people. In 2022, the state Legislature voted to bar transgender girls and women from participating in school sports matching their gender identity from sixth grade through college."

      "TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey's top court on Thursday agreed to temporarily pause a lower court decision that determined the attorney general overstepped his authority when he took control of the Paterson Police Department.",
      "The Supreme Court of New Jersey's temporary pause means Attorney General Matt Platkin's officer in charge will remain in control of the department, the attorney general said. The high court issued the stay without elaboration, and Attorney General Matt Platkin praised the decision in a post on X.",
      "\u201cAs our appeal proceeds, the PPD will continue to run as it has since March 2023: ensuring public safety while strengthening community trust,\u201d Platkin said.",
      "On Wednesday, the New Jersey Appellate Division said Platkin had no authority to \u201csupersede,\u201d or take over, Paterson's police force in March 2023 after the headline-grabbing death of Najee Seabrooks, who was fatally shot by officers after barricading himself in an apartment bathroom.",
      "The court directed Platkin to return control of the police department to city officials and return Police Chief Engelbert Ribeiro to the city from a police training commission, but that decision is on hold after the Supreme Court's order.",
      "The court's decision comes as the Biden administration puts other departments under a microscope, including Trenton's, which it said has a pattern and practice of misconduct, and as Platkin has called for more police accountability around the state. .",
      "Paterson has a population of about 160,000 and lies about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. Its demographics shifted in recent decades from a mostly white city to one today where Black residents account for nearly 24% and Hispanics for just over 60% of the population.",
      "As Paterson\u2019s Black population grew, it found itself clashing with the city\u2019s white power structure, particularly its police force. Platkin said earlier this year that he wouldn't blame residents for being distrustful of the police.",
      "Since the start of 2019, city police fatally shot four people; two others, including Jameek Lowery, have died after being restrained.",
      "The appeals court's ruling left in place Platkin's takeover of the police department's internal affairs unit \u2014 the group charged with investigating the department itself in certain cases. City officials did not challenge the attorney general's takeover of that part of the department."

      "This is the third feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Ovarian cancer is \u201crare, underfunded, and deadly\", says Audra Moran, head of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (Ocra), a global charity based in New York.",
      "Like all cancers, the earlier it is detected the better.",
      "Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too.",
      "\"Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,\" says Ms Moran.",
      "But new blood tests are emerging that use the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to spot signs of the cancer in its very early stages.",
      "And it's not just cancer, AI can also speed up other blood tests for potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.",
      "Dr Daniel Heller is a biomedical engineer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.",
      "His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.",
      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",
      "In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.",
      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",

      "More AI and Medicine",
      "A big challenge in using AI to develop blood tests for ovarian cancer research is that it is relatively rare, which limits the data for training algorithms.",
      "And much of even that data is siloed in hospitals that treated them, with minimal data sharing for researchers.",
      "Dr Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few 100 patients as a \"Hail Mary pass\".",
      "But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try.",
      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",
      "Dr Heller has high hopes for the tech.",
      "\"What we'd like to do is triage all gynaecological disease - so when someone comes in with a complaint, can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it's more likely to be a cancer or not, or this cancer than that.\"",
      "Dr Heller says this may be \"three to five years\" away.",
      "It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.",
      "For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection.",
      "But new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process.",
      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",
      "\u201cBefore our test, a patient with pneumonia would have 15 to 20 different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital - that's about $20,000 in testing,\u201d says Karius chief executive Alec Ford.",
      "Karius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points. Test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen.",
      "Mr Ford says that would have been impossible without AI.",
      "One challenge is that researchers don\u2019t necessarily currently understand all the connections that an AI might make between the test biomarkers and the diseases.",
      "Over the last two years Dr Slav\u00e9 Petrovski has developed an AI platform called Milton that, using biomarkers in the UK biobank data to identify 120 diseases with a success rate of over 90%.",
      "Finding patterns in such a mass of data is only something that AI can do.",
      "\u201cThese are often complex patterns, where there may not be one biomarker, but you have to take into consideration the whole pattern,\u201d says Dr Petrovski, whose is a researcher at pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca.",
      "Dr Heller uses a similar pattern matching technique in his work on ovarian cancer.",
      "\"We know that the sensor binds and responds to proteins and small molecules in the blood, but we don't know which of the proteins or molecules are specific to cancer,\" he says.",

      "It said the majority of crypto stolen this year was due to compromised private keys - which are used to control access to users' assets on crypto platforms.",
      "\"Given that centralised exchanges manage substantial amounts of user funds, the impact of a private key compromise can be devastating\", the study added.",
      "Some of the most significant incidents this year included the theft of the equivalent of $300m in bitcoin from Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, DMM Bitcoin, and the loss of nearly $235m from WazirX, an India-based crypto exchange.",
      "The US government has said the North Korean regime resorts to cryptocurrency theft and other forms of cybercrime to circumvent international sanctions and raise money.",
      "Last week, a federal court in St Louis indicted 14 North Koreans for allegedly being part of a long-running conspiracy aimed at extorting funds from US companies and funnelling money to Pyongyang's weapons programmes.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will make a key decision which could unlock compensation for millions of motorists.",
    "story": [
      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "But the higher Supreme Court has now agreed to hear an appeal against the decision.",
      "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also allowed motor finance providers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the total cost of compensation could reach \u00a325bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator has extended the time providers have to consider complaints until December 2025, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",
      "The time period covers claims regarding leasing deals, as well as Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) agreements.",
      "The FCA also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision when it reconsiders the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "It wants an orderly compensation system, if it comes to that.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, welcomed the extension.",
      "However, others have questioned whether it creates a further compensation delay for those who were mis-sold these agreements."

      "The Supreme Court is the highest legal authority in the US, and the decision to take on TikTok's case is significant as it only hears 100 or so cases a year out of the more than 7,000 petitions it receives.",
      "TikTok had previously argued that the attempt to ban it was unconstitutional because it would impact the free speech of its users in the country.",
      "TikTok said Wednesday it was pleased with the Supreme Court's order.",
      "\"We believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC.",
      "The appeal sets up a clash between free speech and national security, according to University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",
      "\"The appeals court found that national security was stronger than the First Amendment contentions. However, the Justices will scrutinize the potentially conflicting, but significant, values,\" Mr Tobias said in an email.",
      "While it is difficult to predict the outcome, Cornell professor Sarah Kreps said it would be surprising to the court to overturn the prior rulings and go against the wills of both congress and the White House.",
      "\"The case has already gone through the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the lower court, all of which upheld the argument that TikTok's ownership by China-based ByteDance poses a national security risk,\" Dr Kreps said.",
      "Will Trump intervene?",
      "TikTok's future does not just hang on the legal process, however - Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election may also hand it a lifeline.",
      "He met TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported, citing sources familiar with the meeting.",
      "Trump has publicly said he opposes the ban, despite supporting one in his first term as president.",
      "But he will not take office until 20 January, the day after the deadline for TikTok to be banned or sold.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,\" he claimed at a press conference on Monday - though a majority of 18 to 29-year-olds backed his opponent Kamala Harris.",
      "\"There are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that,\" he said.",
      "But despite Trump's support, senior Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, urged the Supreme Court to reject TikTok's bid.",
      "In a brief filed to the court, he called the firm's arguments \"meritless and unsound.\"",
      "TikTok has the backing of some civil liberties organisations however.",
      "A group of them have made a joint filing to the court urging it to block the banning of a platform which they argue \"millions use every day to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves.\"",
      "Kelsey Chickering from market research firm Forrester said Instagram's parent company Meta would be a major beneficiary of ban on TikTok.",
      "\"TikTok is central to a thriving creator economy, and a ban would effectively create a Meta monopoly on short-form video,\" Ms Chickering said, citing a Forrester survey that found 56% of TikTok users would switch to Instagram Reels in that event."

      "That is a lot lower than its peak during the cost of living crisis. In 2022, inflation soared to 11.2% because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",

      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What has gone up in price?",
      "The Office for National Statistics, which calculates the inflation rate, highlighted the rising cost of petrol and diesel as one of the key reasons behind the latest inflation rise.",
      "Tobacco products went up after the chancellor raised taxes on them in the Budget. Clothing, footwear and electronic games also cost more.",
      "But in general the price of services, such as theatre and concert tickets, education and health, rose faster than goods.",
      "The cost of housing, including rent, which is calculated under a different headline figure, also rose sharply in the year to November - up by 7.8%.",
      "But air travel saw its biggest November price fall since the start of the century.",
      "Will prices keep rising?",
      "Prices are almost always rising a bit; around 2% a year is considered a healthy rate of inflation.",
      "Much lower than that risks people delaying purchases because they may get cheaper. A little inflation encourages you to buy sooner - and that boosts economic growth.",
      "But the Bank of England currently predicts that inflation will edge up to 2.75% in the second half of next year before falling again.",
      "The government's official forecasting body, the Office for Budget Responsibility, expects a similar increase. It has said policies announced in the recent Budget - including firms passing on higher costs from rises in employer national insurance and the minimum wage - would help drive inflation higher.",
      "Could there be another cost of living crisis?",
      "No-one is currently forecasting another big burst of inflation, but predicting the future path of prices is difficult, given all the factors that could influence them, from incoming US President Donald Trump's policies on trade to the mood of shoppers on the High Street.",
      "On average, wages are now rising faster than prices, which helps to relieve the pressure, but of course prices for most things remain significantly higher than they were a few years ago.",
      "Housing costs, whether rents or mortgages, especially are a major source of financial pressure for a lot of people.",
      "Even if the rate of inflation does come down next year, that does not mean prices will fall. They will just rise more slowly, leaving most things more expensive than they were before.",

      "On Thursday, the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee will meet to discuss whether to cut rates.",
      "They are not expected to bring rates down from their current 4.75%.",
      "That is because higher interest rates help keep inflation in check by dampening down borrowing and spending. If borrowing gets cheaper, people are likely to have more money to spend which could mean prices rise faster.",
      "So the higher inflation figure, added to the news earlier in the week that wages are growing faster than before, will have given the Bank more reason to wait.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended the decision to reject compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age, arguing that the taxpayer \"simply can't afford the tens of billions of pounds\" in payments.",
      "He added that \"90% of those impacted knew about the changes that were taking place\".",
      "However, during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir was repeatedly pressed on the government's decision, with one MP calling for a vote.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign group say that 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men.",
      "In 1995, the government increased the pension age for women from 60 to 65, phasing in the change between 2010 and 2020.",
      "The coalition government of 2010 opted to speed up the process, bringing forward the qualifying age of 65 to 2018.",
      "Waspi says many of the affected women had made financial plans based on the old state pension age and some retired before realising they could not claim their pension.",
      "The group been pushing for compensation, previously suggesting that some women should receive \u00a310,000 each, at a cost of \u00a336bn.",
      "The current government's decision not to award payments comes despite an independent government review in March which recommended compensation  of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,950 for each of those affected.",
      "Rebecca Hilsenrath, head of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, which wrote the review, told Times Radio that although the government had accepted that it had delayed writing to 1950s-born women by 28 months, and apologised, it had rejected paying compensation.",

      "What is the row about women's pensions?",
      "Before this year's general election, several senior Labour figures had backed the campaign and Sir Keir himself signed a pledge for \"fair and fast compensation\" in 2022.",
      "In 2019, Angela Rayner, now the deputy prime minister, told the BBC: \"They [the government] stole their pensions\u2026we've said we'd right that injustice and within the five years of the Labour government we'll compensate them for the money that they've lost.\"",
      "In the first Prime Minister's Questions since the government announced they would not be providing compensation, veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said the Waspi women had \"fought one of the most sustained and passionate campaigns for justice that I can remember, year in, year out\".",
      "\"Does the prime minister really understand how let down Waspi women feel today?\" she asked.",
      "Ian Byrne, an independent MP, said the women were owed compensation for the \"injustice done to them\" and urged the prime minister to hold a vote on the subject.",
      "And Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Labour had \"played politics\" with the group by previously supporting their campaign.",
      "\"She [Rayner] promised to compensate them in full... now they admit we were right all along.\"",
      "Responding to the criticism, Sir Keir said the delays to telling women about pension changes were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"I'm afraid to say that taxpayers simply can't afford the tens of billions of pounds in compensation when the evidence shows that 90% of those impacted did know about it, that's because of the state of our economy.\"",
      "Following PMQs, a No 10 spokesman said that since winning the election, the government had \"had the chance\" to look at the ombudsman's report, which said the women \"faced no direct financial loss as a result of the delays\".",
      "The government has said compensation could cost up to \u00a310.5bn.",
      "But Ms De Spon said many Waspi women \"didn't know\" about the pensions changes, and added that even to this day women were saying: \"I never even received a letter, let alone when I received a letter.\"",
      "She added that former Conservative Chancellor George Osborne had saved more than \u00a3180bn by raising the state pension age and \"boasted that it was easiest money he had ever saved\".",
      "\"We're asking for a tiny fraction of that back as compensation for government failure,\" she said.",
      "The Waspi campaign also accused the prime minister of spreading \"dangerous misinformation\" by saying 90% of women had been aware of changes to the pension age.",
      "\"The fact that 90% of women had some general awareness of potential changes in the future does not mean they knew this would impact them personally,\" said Waspi chair Angela Madden.",
      "Diane Abbott is one of a small group of Labour MPs objecting to their leader's approach. Kate Osborne and Emma Lewell-Buck have also publicly opposed the decision.",
      "The SNP is calling for a vote in Parliament on compensation. The party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said: \"Labour Party politicians posed with Waspi women before the election only to leave them high and dry when they got into government.\"",
      "Earlier, Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith also said the decision was \"a betrayal\", adding that Cabinet ministers had \"queued up, had their photo taken with Waspi women, talked about how they were going to remedy that injustice.\"",
      "He said \"we won't know\" whether a Conservative government would have paid compensation as they were voted out of government before making that decision.",
      "The then Conservative-run Department of Work and Pensions told the ombudsman at the time of its report in March why it could not pay out.",
      "It cited \"the costs involved, the time it would take, the amount of resource it would involve, and the negative impact delivering a remedy would have on it being able to maintain other services\".",

      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",

      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

      "The bill was put forward to Parliament on the same day as Sara Sharif's father and stepmother were sentenced for her murder.",
      "The 10-year-old victim was removed from primary school in order to be home-educated four months before she died.",

      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill will make sure that teachers and schools are always involved in decisions around safeguarding children in their area, and that if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe, local authorities have the power to intervene.",
      "A unique identifier number will be given to children across services, similar to an adult's national insurance number.",
      "'Work together'",
      "Phillipson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government wanted \"everyone pulling together to keep children safe\".",
      "The unique identifier would enable information held by different services, such as health and education, to be shared between them - to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks, the education secretary said.",
      "\"It's about police, schools, children's social care.\"",
      "\"The measures today will require those agencies to work together much more effectively to keep children safe.\"",
      "Under the government's plans, parents will no longer have an automatic right to educate their children at home if their child is under a child protection plan, and will have to acquire the local council's permission first.",
      "The previous government had also proposed creating a register of children who are not in school.",
      "But the Children's Charities Coalition, representing Action for Children, Barnardo's, the National Children's Bureau, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and The Children's Society, said: \"The money announced today falls far short of what's needed.",

      "But not everyone agrees with plans for a register.",
      "\"International research is clear that introducing registers for home-educated children makes no positive difference whatsoever to those children's outcomes, and leads to fewer being known to public bodies,\" Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, told the BBC.",
      "\"Promises of support have been made for about fifteen years now and have yet to materialise.",
      "\"Over 100,000 children are already registered with local authorities as home-educated, new legislation is not needed to offer those families requested support,\" she added.",
      "There have been several attempts to introduce a register over the last decade by successive governments, but all have failed.",
      "Phillipson told the BBC's Breakfast programme she was worried about the \"big increase\" in home-schooling.",
      "\"I respect the rights of parents to seek to home-educate their children,\" she said.",
      "\"My concern is that some parents are choosing to opt out of the system because they feel their children's needs are not being met.",

      "The Education Policy Institute warned that up to 300,000 children may be missing from education entirely.",

    "summary": "The BBC speaks with parents who insist the school system is \"broken\" as latest government estimates point to a rise in home education.",
    "story": [
      "\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in.",
      "\"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\"",
      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",
      "Where next for Iran now that its 'Axis of Resistance' is shattered",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

    "summary": "The British actress has reunited with Mike Leigh for a film that could score her an Oscar nomination.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly three decades after being nominated for an Oscar, British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste is back in the awards race thanks to a tremendous performance in director Mike Leigh's new drama, Hard Truths.",
      "The 57-year-old jokes she feels \"older and wider\" (rather than wiser) this time around - a line she credits to co-star Michele Austin, who plays her on-screen sister.",
      "But waistlines aside, her reunion with Leigh, whom she first worked with on 1996's Secrets & Lies, has prompted some of the most positive reviews of her career.",
      "Hard Truths centres on Pansy, a woman who is constantly grumpy and miserable, and the impact her unspoken depression has on those around her.",
      "It would be unfair to call the film a comeback for Jean-Baptiste, because she has been working tirelessly in the intervening years. But her second collaboration with Leigh has led to renewed attention on the film awards circuit.",
      "\"It's kind of a full circle moment, rather than a comeback,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"It's very interesting, because the first time, I was not aware at all that we were even in an Oscar race. You've got to remember, in 1996, there was still a huge independent film presence in the United States.",
      "\"At that time, we weren't that aware of the whole Oscar thing. It was something that happened over there,\" she says, gesturing far away, \"with really big stars. So it really was not on our radar.\"",
      "Having won the top prize at Cannes, it was only when Secrets & Lies played at the New York Film Festival four months later that Jean-Baptiste became more aware of the awards buzz. \"I hadn't even heard of the Golden Globes at that point,\" she recalls.",
      "\"We were just talking about the film, doing loads of interviews, we were just knackered from all the plane rides, so there was a naivety to it the first time.",
      "\"Now we have the internet and it's become more of an aggressive pursuit of those awards. The campaigning process has changed quite a lot. Or maybe it hasn't and we just weren't aware of it back then.\"",
      "Leigh and Jean-Baptiste have \"kept in touch over the years\", she explains - which ultimately led to their second project together.",
      "Hard Truths has been praised for its hard-hitting but nuanced depiction of depression and complex family dynamics.",
      "There is humour in many of the scenes as Pansy starts arguments with pretty much everyone she encounters, from her closest relatives to her dentist. The man in the car park who asks if she's leaving gets it with both barrels.",
      "But there is something deeper going on. Although the word \"depression\" isn't mentioned in the film, it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "\"Yeah, it's not spoken,\" Jean-Baptiste says. \"And the interesting thing about that is the whole family, everyone that she comes into contact with, other than her sister, just sort of gets on with it.",
      "\"It's under the surface. 'Oh, it's just Pansy.' And so many people live like that, where you have somebody that's really difficult, and nobody says to them, 'Man, what is it? What's really going on?' You just sort of avoid them.\"",
      "On paper, it might sound like fun for an actor to play such a juicy, bad-tempered character. But Jean-Baptiste's performance reveals something much more complex.",
      "\"People have asked if it was cathartic, the chance to just spew. But no, it wasn't like that,\" she says. \"I felt the very real pain, anxiety and fear. There was not a lot of enjoyment to be had in that.",
      "\"And also, Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",
      "'Raw and realistic'",
      "In her review of Hard Truths, Carla Hay of Culture Mix said Jean-Baptiste \"gives a fierce and complex performance\", describing it as \"a raw and realistic portrayal of how toxic anger and untreated mental illness can affect a family\".",
      "\"Even at its funniest, Hard Truths finds Marianne Jean-Baptiste channelling an anger that feels excruciatingly real,\" wrote Slant's Cole Kronman.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Jon Frosch noted that Leigh \"pushes the bounds of our empathy and asks us to look, really look, at someone from whom we'd surely avert our gaze if we had the misfortune of crossing her path in real life\".",
      "Leigh famously spends several months rehearsing, and crafts his script based on improvisation sessions with the actors.",
      "\"Basically, the process is to create a character from scratch,\" Jean-Baptiste explains. \"Their first memory, their education, house they grew up in, family members, neighbours, where the local park was. Minute detail.\"",
      "The actors are then introduced to one another to build their characters' relationships. \"We do all sorts of exercises to establish the family routines and the traditions. We do improvisations based on, 'What's Sunday dinner like?'\"",
      "By the time shooting begins, the script is firmly in place. \"Nothing is ever improvised on camera,\" she explains. \"So we rehearse it and rehearse it.\"",
      "Oscars record",
      "Jean-Baptiste is speaking to BBC News the morning after the British Independent Film Awards, where she won best lead performance, one of several early accolades she has picked up.",
      "If she is ultimately shortlisted by Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 17 January, Jean-Baptiste could become the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting.",
      "Coincidentally, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo is also a contender for best actress - meaning she could match that record, after also being nominated in 2020.",
      "\"I guess it's a sign of progress, and I think it's all great,\" Jean-Baptiste reflects. \"It's recognition for a job well done, I guess.\"",
      "Four black actresses from the US have previously scored two Academy nominations - Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.",
      "Jean-Baptiste agrees strides have been made on diversity nearly a decade on from the OscarsSoWhite movement, but notes that the real issue is whether the work is available in the first place.",
      "\"I think [awards bodies] are trying. It's always going to come back down to opportunity, though,\" she says.",
      "\"If the films aren't being made that feature black women [or] Asian women in the lead role, then they don't even stand a chance of being nominated.",
      "\"So we always have to come back to the opportunities in the first place, the work being made, the stories being told.\"",
      "Notably, Jean-Baptiste now lives in Los Angeles - a place many British actors have moved to for the sake of their careers.",
      "\"Well, I was being offered work out there, so it made sense actually, because in the end I left to do a job that would require me to be there for an extended amount of time,\" she explains, referring to her 2000s TV police drama Without A Trace.",
      "\"Because that show went on for seven years. I'd been flying back and forth for the first year or two of the show, and then it was like, you know what, this is a lot. It's a long flight just for a weekend.\"",
      "When she's back in the UK, she relishes the chance to catch up on British theatre and read books on the London Underground (\"You have to drive in LA, so it's books on tape\").",
      "For now, though, her focus is on Hard Truths, which will be released in the UK on 31 January. Jean-Baptiste hopes viewers ultimately leave the film with \"a bit more compassion for people, difficult people\".",
      "\"Not to avoid them, necessarily, but just sort of ask your aunt what's going on, and if there's something you can do to help. Don't assume you're going to be berated for doing it.\"",

      "It comes at a key moment for Hollywood, which is trying to retain excitement around blockbuster films after a number of box office misfires and the onset of \"superhero fatigue\".",
      "DC has struggled to find major hits in recent years, with films like Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman 1984 and Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux - part of the wider DC stable - each earning less than $60m (\u00a348m) at the North American box office.",

      "The film is expected to focus on its titular character balancing his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing.",
      "Gunn has said it starts \"right in the middle of the action\", with Superman already in existence, and \"takes place over a short amount of time\".",
      "He has also said there's \"plenty of humor in it\" - although less than in some of his previous films like Suicide Squad or Guardians of the Galaxy.",
      "\"People like Rachel are so funny and David is very [funny as well], so there's humour in it,\" he said.",
      "\"But it's trying to create something that is grounded, but also it's an incredibly fanciful world, it's fantasy, it's taking from other things like Game of Thrones, where it's this universe where superheroes actually exist. What are they like? There's a magic there that's undeniable.\"",
      "Corenswet's Superman is seen wearing the hero's famous red trunks - but Gunn said he was \"on the no-trunks team for a long time\" before filming started, until the star convinced him otherwise.",
      "\"One of the things David said is that Superman wants kids to not be afraid of him. He's an alien. He's got these incredible powers. He shoots beams out of his eyes, can blow the truck over.",
      "\"He's this incredibly powerful, could be considered scary individual and he wants people to like him. He wants to be a symbol of hope and positivity.",
      "\"So he dresses like a professional wrestler, he dresses in a way that makes people unafraid of him. That shows that. And I was like, that really clicked in for me.\""

      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",

      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",

      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",

They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",

      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",

      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",

      "During the pandemic, deaths caused by alcohol rose sharply across the UK. Heavier drinkers were drinking more while others, including more moderate drinkers, cut down or gave up entirely.",
      "And when pubs were shut, many people started buying alcohol in shops and drinking at home.",

      "Mr Jabbar left the hospital in 2023 after a Royal College of Surgeons inquiry found he had performed \"incorrect\" or \"inappropriate\" surgery in several cases.",
      "A spokesperson for Gosh said it understood \"why Alana and her family are worried\"  and apologised that \"they feel information was withheld from them\".",
      "Mr Jabbar had operated on Jodee's daughter in 2022, when she was eight years old, fitting metal plates into her knees for leg lengthening and straightening.",
      "He was a leading surgeon at the renowned hospital, operating on children with complicated disorders and carrying out procedures, such as the one undergone by Alana, who has a complex chromosome abnormality.",
      "The hospital has since initiated independent reports into each of his 723 patients to conclude what level of harm they had experienced.",
      "Some cases linked to Mr Jabbar resulted in harm, including life-long injuries and amputation.",
      "Jodee, from Essex, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that she had no idea of the doctor's reputation when her daughter Alana was referred to his care in 2021.",
      "At that point, concerns had already been raised about Mr Jabbar.",
      "She said that at the family's first consultation in March 2021, which lasted \"about five minutes\", Mr Jabbar had advised the invasive surgery.",
      "\"We didn't want to rock the boat too much because he seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing,\" she said.",
      "\"So we kind of went along with it thinking he's an orthopaedic surgeon, it's Great Ormond Street [Hospital]. We trusted him.\"",
      "She said she was told the surgery would improve Alana's mobility and put her \"knee into place... and then from there we could assess whether anything else needed to be done\".",
      "The operation took place 10 months later, in January 2022. During that period, more professional complaints from other surgeons were raised with the managers at the hospital.",
      "None of this was ever disclosed to Jodee or other families of Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "She said the surgery had appeared to go well and, with Alana's leg bandaged up, there had not seemed to be any immediate problems.",
      "But when the bandage came off a few weeks later, Jodee saw two scars instead of one on the inside of her child's leg when they had been told it would be just one incision.",
      "\"The alarm bells rang at that point,\" she said.",
      "As weeks went by, the mobility of Alana, now aged 11, was not improving and she was reporting pain frequently, often needing painkillers.",
      "Jodee said she had thought at first: \"Well, maybe it just hasn't worked? Maybe that wasn't the right procedure and it will be removed? Or maybe it's just too early to tell?\"",
      "She said she had expected regular check-ups from the hospital but a follow-up appointment did not come until July - six months after the operation.",
      "The plates in Alana's knees were supposed to be there for about two years and Jodee says another surgeon at the hospital recommended keeping the plates in place at the follow-up appointment.",
      "Then, by chance, they saw Mr Jabbar on the same visit.",
      "Jodee said he took one look and said they \"needed to come out immediately\" and asked the family to return the following day for another major operation.",
      "He told the family he was worried Alana's tendons could re-fuse to the metal plates, Jodee said.",
      "\"We were really panicked, we were really worried.... [thinking] 'What have we done, is she okay, is it long-term damage?'\"",
      "They returned to the hospital in August 2022 to have the plates removed.",
      "But the family's concern was now so strong that they moved Alana to a different hospital months after.",
      "Jodee said her daughter's mobility was now \"worse\" and that she was \"still having falls\".",
      "Jodee said she was not informed of anything wrong with Mr Jabbar's work until February this year, more than 16 months on.",
      "She said the hospital informed her only in a brief letter with few details.",
      "\"It seemed like quite a general letter... nothing to worry about,\" she said.",
      "She did not realise the extent of Mr Jabbar's reported misconduct until media reports.",
      "\"I did not realise the scale of it or what actually happened or that there had been so many complaints,\" she added.",
      "\"I just felt sick, to be honest,\" she said. \"So obviously devastated. As a parent, obviously you want to protect your child, it is the number one priority. And I knew something was amiss when we had seen him.\"",

      "\"It does actually feel like they've been gaslighting the whole way,\" she added.",

      "\"It's really important for other people to know what's happened and to understand if they're being gaslighted as well, that they're not alone, that this is what's going on,\" she said.",
      "A spokesperson for the hospital said it was sorry to all concerned families, adding that after the Royal College of Surgeons report, it had asked external experts to review all Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "The statement goes on: \"They are working at pace [...]  We understand why Alana and her family are worried [...] and we have reached out to them.",
      "\"We are sorry they feel that information was withheld from them. Once concerns were raised about the surgeon's practice in June 2022, we shared these with the General Medical Council and undertook rapid fact-finding. During this period the surgeon's practice was restricted to simple procedures [...] and always as part of a wider surgical team.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 01:44:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Hospitals say they often struggle to recover costs, particularly when patients return overseas.",
    "story": [
      "London hospitals have written off more than \u00a3112m in unpaid treatment bills from overseas patients between 2018 and 2023, according to figures obtained by the BBC.",
      "Under current NHS regulations, hospital trusts in England must charge patients who are not \"ordinarily resident\" in the UK for non-urgent treatment.",
      "Critics argue that the current system for recouping these costs is unfair and ineffective.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it expected all NHS trusts to recover any charges not paid in advance wherever possible.",
      "The BBC contacted all 32 of London's acute hospital trusts about their overseas patient billing.",
      "The responding NHS trusts invoiced a total of \u00a3223m for such treatments over the five-year period, but \u00a3112m was subsequently written off as bad debt.",
      "Though emergency and GP services remain free for everyone, trusts are required to bill for other types of non-urgent treatment for patients who do not ordinarily reside in the UK and charge at 150% of standard NHS rates.",
      "This premium is meant to cover the administrative burden of identifying patients and pursuing payment.",
      "While aimed at tackling \"health tourism\", the charging system has exemptions for vulnerable groups including asylum seekers and trafficking victims.",
      "But hospitals often struggle to recover costs, particularly when patients return overseas.",
      "Trusts balance their legal obligation to recover costs and the realities of treating patients in need, many of whom have limited means or face other barriers to payment.",
      "Barts Health, serving a large population in east London, wrote off \u00a335m in unpaid bills over the five years - the highest among all responding London trusts.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"Where appropriate, we make every effort to recover payment from patients who are liable for the cost of their treatment.",
      "\"However, many patients may have limited funds available and some will not be resident in the UK, which means recovering payment can be difficult.\"",
      "'Fairness and proportionality'",
      "King's College Hospital abandoned \u00a317m, while 10 other trusts each wrote off more than \u00a31m in unrecovered fees.",
      "A spokesperson for King's College Hospital said: \"We take seriously our legal obligation to identify patients presenting at our hospitals who are not eligible for free NHS treatment.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the trust works \"to ensure we embed fairness and proportionality principles into our income recovery processes\".",
      "Lewisham and Greenwich Trust, which wrote off \u00a311m, said it would \"never deter anyone from seeking treatment, especially as many of these patients are using our maternity services\".",
      "A spokesperson emphasised that they \"work closely\" with patient groups and partners on charging arrangements, \"always ensuring we act in an empathetic, compassionate and supportive way towards all patients\".",
      "'I feel like a negative person here'",
      "The British Medical Association (BMA) has been consistently critical of the charging policy, arguing that it deters vulnerable groups from accessing necessary healthcare while diverting NHS staff time away from patient care.",
      "Patients like Beni, who asked the BBC to change his name, say it can be devastating.",
      "A disabled man applying for UK residency, Beni was pursued for \u00a3495 after attending two hospital appointments for a prosthetic leg fitting by a London hospital trust.",
      "\"It was a horrible experience or negative experience because the hospital was very rude with me and more aggressive with me even though I'm disabled and I needed some help,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"I felt like I'm a negative person here, because I cannot do anything. Cannot work, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"They charged me \u00a3495 just for checking, and it was very expensive for me because at that time I couldn't work and I didn't have any income.",
      "\"So, I tried to pay it monthly for a long time until I can finish it.\"",
      "The BMA also maintains that doctors should not have a role in assessing patients' eligibility for free NHS care.",
      "Dr Omar Forge Risk, a campaigner against NHS charging for overseas patients, said the charging system was harmful to public health.",
      "\"The reality is that if [patients] were paying back any more, it would push them into destitution,\" he said.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're charging patients and pushing them more into ill health and into destitution, the costs from any perspective will be greater in the long run.\"",
      "'Health tourism is a massive problem'",
      "The BBC spoke to several doctors who recounted their experiences with the charging system, though they did not wish to be identified.",
      "An emergency medicine practitioner who previously worked in London said they had \"multiple patients\" who came to this country in renal failure, from a variety of different countries, because they could not get treatment or it was too expensive to get dialysis in their own country.",
      "A central London oncologist argued that \"health tourism is a massive problem, it's a huge problem\".",
      "\"Everyone knows the NHS is free at the point of care and most doctors will say it's not their responsibility to police the system,\" they said.",
      "\"It's difficult when a patient is desperate for care. Policing needs to occur at an earlier stage.\"",
      "'Maximum value'",
      "Government modelling published in 2023 by the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt estimated that more consistent charging of overseas patients could yield an extra \u00a3500m per year for the NHS.",
      "However, the true extent of unpaid bills remains unclear, as the \u00a3223m invoiced only represents patients identified as chargeable, while many others may receive treatment without ever being billed.",
      "The current government has defended the charging system and said \"tens of millions of pounds\" were recovered each year.",
      "A DHSC spokesperson added: \"Overseas visitors - and those who are not lawfully settled here \u2013 should contribute towards their treatment in recognition of the additional cost to the NHS.",

    "story": [
      "Former professional darts champion Kevin Painter has thrown arrows almost every day for 40 years.",
      "Throughout his career he thrived under pressure, playing in the most prestigious competitions and taking home more than \u00a3900,000 in prize money.",
      "But earlier this year, he went to throw a dart and it physically would not leave his hand.",
      "\"You're in shock, I stood there for ages. I just couldn't get my arm up to let go of the dart,\" he said.",
      "Kevin was suffering from dartitis, a mental condition where the brain stops a player from being able to release a dart.",
      "Finding a cure would become the 57-year-old's latest challenge.",
      "\"[Dartitis is] in the absence of any physical trauma, it's purely psychological,\" said Dr Linda Duffy, professor of psychology at Middlesex University.",
      "From 1982 to 1987 she was ranked women's world number one and also experienced dartitis.",
      "\"I used to combat it with extra practice. It was heard of back in the day, but not many people spoke about it,\" she said.",
      "Dartitis can affect all players, professional or amateur.",
      "Jack Langston, a darts referee and online content creator, was 12 when he first experienced the condition.",
      "\"There was a little pause just before I threw the dart,\" he said.",
      "It was barely noticeable at first but eventually it became so bad he would take 60 seconds to throw three darts.",
      "By the age of 13, he was forced to quit and at the time, considered his darts career to be over.",
      "\"You're turning up and getting beat by people you know you should be beating,\" he said.",
      "\"It's so demoralising. It's a real mental struggle.\"",
      "Every case is different, and there is no one single cause, but lots of players report it comes from a fear of missing.",
      "\"It's brought on by anxiety and stress,\" Kevin said.",
      "\"Where others have panic attacks, for me it manifested as dartitis.\"",
      "Dr Duffy says that - perhaps due to its name - players have a tendency to view dartitis as a problem unique to the sport which therefore demands unique solutions.",
      "\"It's just another cognitive disorder, so it should be treated that way,\" she says. \"The underlying mechanisms that cause dartitis are the same things that cause any other anxiety disorder.\"",
      "She recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to enable the player to reframe dartitis as a challenge they need to overcome.",
      "Kevin has been trying to conquer the condition with hypnotherapy - and CBT - taking sessions with Chris O'Connor whose company Eccleston Park Hypnotherapy is the official \"hypnotherapy partner\" of the Professional Darts Players Association (PDPA).",
      "During his sessions, the patient lies on a sofa and is guided into a trance where they are then \"hit with all the confidence work and the motivation work\", Mr O'Connor said.",
      "\"It's all about getting them to visualise an area of their life they want to improve.\"",
      "After eight sessions, it seemed Kevin's dartitis had been cured for good. But two weeks later, during a televised match at the World Senior Darts tour, the condition returned. \"I was really, really disappointed,\" he said. \"I thought it had gone.\"",
      "He's now back working with Mr O'Connor on cracking the disorder long term.",
      "The therapy Mr O'Connor offers is tailored for each person he treats, using a mixture of Solution Focused Brief Therapy, hypnosis and visualization techniques to eliminate dartitis, he said.",
      "Mr O'Connor said: \"It's results-based, with clients often noticing changes after just a few sessions.",
      "\"I work with four world champions across UFC, darts, and snooker, and seven elite PDC darts players in the world top 30. So far, I have helped over 50 clients eliminate dartitis in the last two years.\"",
      "Unlike Kevin, Jack has managed to shake his dartitis and with lasting results.",
      "In January, the 31-year-old decided to start throwing with his left hand.",
      "\"[It was] the biggest decision of my entire life playing darts,\" he said.",
      "But it worked, and within three months he was winning matches at amateur tournaments.",
      "Alongside his better performances, Jack found another benefit - he no longer needed to drink alcohol to play.",
      "\"I used to shake if I didn't have a beer I'd be so nervous,\" he said.",
      "\"If you'd have told me a year ago I'd play darts sober, I wouldn't have believed you.\"",
      "In another bid to aid his recovery, Kevin has also started to drink less.",
      "Despite there being no established link between drinking and dartitis, it's a sign of his determination to try everything to kick the condition.",
      "\"It's no secret everyone likes a drink when they play,\" he said.",
      "\"But you have to put the effort [into the treatment]. I like to go for a walk in the mornings to clear my head.\"",
      "\"Everyone's been very supportive,\" he said.",
      "\"I've spoken to so many people who have it or have had it. I wouldn't have had those conversations if I didn't get dartitis.\""

      "November's borrowing figure was down by \u00a33.4bn from the same month last year and below expectations of around \u00a313bn.",

      "However, its latest survey period did not cover the official Black Friday date of 29 November.",
      "The latest economic figures come after the Bank of England voted to hold interest rates on Thursday, stating it thought the UK economy had performed worse than expected, with no growth at all between October and December.",
      "The Bank downgraded its growth forecast from 0.3% for the final three months of 2024, to zero growth.",
      "The growth revisions were seen as a blow to Labour, which has made growing the economy its top priority.",

      "Before the chancellor's announcement on 29 July, the average number of weekly applications in the UK for Pension Credit, where the government tops up a pensioner's income, was 3,800.",
      "Since August, it's been averaging around 9,400 following campaigns by the government and charities, encouraging people to claim.",
      "The DWP has released data showing there were around 150,000 new applications for Pension Credit in the UK between 29 July and 17 November.",
      "However, the Pensions Minister, Emma Reynolds, told Parliament on 4 December that the total number of unprocessed Pension Credit applications in the end of week commencing 18th November was 91,075.",
      "Not all applications, once processed, are successful and get awarded Pension Credit - around 45% of applications processed since 29 July have been approved.",
      "BBC Verify heard from Simon Livingston in Brighton, who told us he had applied for Pension Credit for his mother in March and was still waiting for a decision.",
      "And Jackie Newberry in Hook in Hampshire applied for Pension Credit for her 95-year-old mother Ena in February and was told she would get a decision by mid-March.",
      "After chasing several times she was finally told her claim had been approved in early December.",
      "'Manage through Christmas'",
      "DWP data shows that in the week of 18 November, the average processing time for a Pension Credit application was 65 working days, or 13 weeks, up from 9 weeks at the end of July.",
      "That average processing time, unless it has picked up, would mean eligible people who submitted an application in November or December would likely not receive their \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 Winter Fuel Payment - and backdated Pension Credit payment -  until February or March 2025.",
      "The former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is now a partner at pension consultants LCP said: \"Although they will eventually receive arrears once Pension Credit comes into payment, including any Winter Fuel Payment to which they would have been entitled, most who were on the waiting list by mid November are likely to have to manage through Christmas and the New Year on a very modest income until their claim is processed\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the Winter Fuel Payment, and our drive to boost Pension Credit take up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the Winter Fuel Payment.\"",
      "\"We have deployed additional staff to support processing applications, seeing a 51% increase in the number of cleared claims since the Chancellor's announcement.\"",
      "The Scottish government has announced that from late 2025 every Scottish pensioner household will receive a winter fuel payment.",
      "The numbers in the UK at risk of delayed payments this year are uncertain because it depends on the rate at which DWP officials are working through the backlog.",
      "More claims processed",
      "The DWP data does point to a significant pick up in the rate at which claims are being processed.",
      "In August, it was processing around 4,500 claims per week. In the first half of November, it was getting through an average of around 9,000.",
      "However, the official backlog figures only go up to the middle of November. There are likely to have been tens of thousands more applications since then.",
      "BBC Verify asked the DWP for the most up-to-date figures for the size of the backlog and the average processing time and they pointed us to the published figures from the middle of November.",
      "The government has set 21 December as the deadline by which eligible people can apply for Pension Credit in time to receive the 2024-25 Winter Fuel Payment.",
      "In 2022, only 63% of those eligible for Pension Credit are estimated by DWP to have claimed it.",
      "After the means-testing of the Winter Fuel Payment was announced in July, the government estimated its awareness campaign would push the take-up rate to 68% - equivalent to an additional 100,000 people.",
      "However, this would still leave roughly 780,000 eligible pensioners who would not be receiving either the Pension Credit or Winter Fuel Payment to which they are entitled because they have not applied.",

      "Senior judges have upheld a decision by MI5 to warn that an alleged Chinese agent had infiltrated Parliament and funded a Labour MP and others.",
      "In a highly significant judgment, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) said that the security service had acted within the law when it named Christine Lee as a threat to national security, in an \"interference alert\" distributed to Parliamentarians and consequently made public.",
      "The IPT said that naming Ms Lee had been \"necessary in a democratic society\" and \"a proportionate response to the threat she posed\".",
      "The January 2022 alert warned that Christine Ching Kui Lee had established links for the Chinese Communist Party with current and aspiring MPs.",

      "Neither Ms Lee nor Mr Yang are facing prosecution over the separate allegations made against them and both have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Ms Lee, a solicitor, had said that her involvement with Parliament had been to \"represent the UK Chinese and increase diversity\".",
      "But the MI5 alert to parliamentarians said that she was \"knowingly engaged in political interference and activities on behalf of the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\".",

      "One of the MPs funded by Ms Lee was Labour's Barry Gardiner, who received more than \u00a3420,000 from her in five years.",
      "He employed Ms Lee's son, Daniel Wilkes, until the alert emerged.",

      "He stressed that he had received no illegal money into his office.",

    "summary": "From fears of an election wipeout to bouncing back with the budget, John Swinney reflects on a chaotic 2024.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a markedly turbulent year on Scotland's frequently bonkers political scene, and for none more than John Swinney.",
      "As recently as April this year, the SNP veteran was a humble backbencher at Holyrood, beginning to contemplate whether he might stand down in 2026.",
      "But then came Humza Yousaf's self-inflicted downfall, which thrust Mr Swinney back into government.",
      "He was back on the campaign trail as his party suffered one of the worst electoral reverses in its history - a result he says could have easily been a wipeout.",
      "And now he insists the SNP is back on the front foot and striding towards a Holyrood vote - where he says he'll seek a full term, to be first minister until 2031.",
      "The first minister spoke to BBC Scotland's Podlitical podcast to go behind the scenes on the big moments of 2024.",
      "The SNP was not in a happy place at the turn of the year.",
      "Humza Yousaf came into office after a fractious leadership contest, and it felt like events were against him at every turn.",
      "Every time he planned a big announcement, Police Scotland seemed to scoop him with a fresh twist in Operation Branchform, the inquiry into the SNP's funding and finances.",
      "Mr Yousaf was also keen to allow more debate around the direction of the SNP, in a break from the very tight circle run by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But it led to constant questions and rebellions over policy, with some contentious proposals being dropped, and particular debate about the party's partnership in government with the Greens.",
      "Mr Yousaf ultimately showed them the door in unceremonious fashion, and within days the Greens made clear they could help return the favour via a confidence vote in Holyrood.",
      "The first minister had to go. And with the SNP teetering on the brink, it turned to John Swinney.",
      "He was seen as taking the job - one he had decided not to run for a year earlier - out of loyalty to his party, rather than personal ambition.",
      "He accepts that his \"sense of duty prevailed\" - \"I felt I had to come back in and strengthen and rebuild my party and its reputation with the public\".",
      "The scale of the problem was immediately clear when a general election was called just weeks later.",
      "Mr Swinney described watching the exit poll come in - delivering the news that the SNP was to lose most of its seats - and thinking \"this could actually have been worse\".",
      "\"The conditions that I inherited, we could quite easily have been wiped out,\" he said. \"I don't think it would have taken much for that to have happened, when you look at the vote shares and all that went on.\"",
      "This isn't to escape the gravity of the result - being slashed from 48 seats to nine was \"an absolutely colossal setback\".",
      "But Mr Swinney always felt he could pick up the pieces.",
      "\"That's why my party turned to me,\" he said. \"They knew if there was one person on the planet who could turn things around for the SNP, it was John Swinney.\"",
      "That kind of bullishness might seem more in the vein of Alex Salmond than John Swinney.",
      "Mr Swinney served as his right-hand man before having a similar role under Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But he says his plans for his own leadership were inspired more by conversations with backbenchers - including Lib Dem Willie Rennie.",
      "The two spoke for \"quite a while\" on the fringes of a gender reform debate at Holyrood which went on deep into the night, and Mr Swinney says he had a vivid realisation that he had got out of the habit of even talking to opposition MSPs.",
      "He had more time for such chats during his period on the back benches, and on returning to government was \"determined I wasn't going to lose that important understanding of the need to connect\".",
      "Running a minority administration, Mr Swinney knows he needs to build bridges and find common ground with opponents in order to get anything done.",
      "But that doesn't mean there's no time for politics.",
      "The draft budget was the culmination of a period of furious manoeuvring between the SNP and Labour, two parties fighting for a very similar voter base and which view each other as their key electoral rival.",
      "It marked a major shift in tone from the government, and potentially of momentum in parliament.",
      "In September, Finance Secretary Shona Robison set out huge in-year cuts to balance the books, talking gloomily about austerity.",
      "Two months later she was announcing eye-catching new initiatives, and pitching a message of \"hope\".",
      "An injection of cash from the Treasury was doubtless pivotal, but Mr Swinney says the \"really tough stuff\" that had to be done in September got the government to a position of sustainability from which they could make more policy choices.",
      "The most striking choice was a promise to mitigate the two-child cap on benefit payments, something ministers had long bemoaned while insisting they had neither the power nor the funding to reverse it.",
      "The announcement was added to the budget so late in the day that the Scottish Fiscal Commission didn't have time to cost it; the watchdog termed it a \"fiscal risk\".",
      "Mr Swinney rejected the notion that the plan had been drafted in at the last moment because the original \"rabbit out of the hat\" - a reinstatement of a winter fuel payment for pensioner households - had to be released a week early.",
      "He said the team drawing up the budget, with himself and his deputy Kate Forbes \"very close to the construction\" along with the finance secretary Shona Robison, were looking for steps that would make the \"maximum impact\" on child poverty.",
      "\"We kept on feeling there wasn't enough there,\" he said, and \"we came to the conclusion that we had to add that into the programme\".",
      "The announcement left Labour in a spin.",
      "It ended a period of several years where the SNP seemed to be in the bunker; ditching controversial policies, desperately trying to scrape together the funds to keep expensive existing pledges afloat, and pitching very little that was new or notable.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon's former chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, said there had been a \"clear statement that the SNP has remembered that being in government enables it to drive the political agenda in Scotland\".",
      "Mr Swinney insists that the SNP is \"back on the front foot, and intend to stay there\".",
      "That will not be straightforward, because many of the pressures facing the party have not gone away.",
      "Operation Branchform will wrap up at some point, one way or another.",
      "The SNP is still short on cash, even more so following the general election catastrophe, and is gutting its HQ of staff.",
      "Mr Swinney still heads a minority administration, one short on goodwill in parliament.",
      "Former flagship policies have run aground - it is only a matter of time until the National Care Service is scrapped, once an excuse to blame the opposition presents itself.",
      "The first test of Mr Swinney's outreach programme will be the votes on the budget in February.",
      "He intends to hit the road in January to \"communicate the advantages of the budget to the public, to make sure the public exert pressure on parliament\" and vote for it.",
      "Appealing to the public is of course a handy thing to do in advance of an election campaign.",
      "Mr Swinney accepts that he might have stood down in 2026, had he remained on the back benches.",
      "Humza Yousaf has announced he is doing just that, making way for a \"new generation\" at the age of 39.",
      "His successor meanwhile will now be pitching himself to serve a full term as first minister, until 2031 - the year he will turn 67.",
      "Mr Swinney says he has been re-energised by what he terms a \"sabbatical year\" - saying that \"the best thing that happened to me was standing down and having a year out of the front line\".",
      "It provided time for parkruns in Perth, walks in the hills and standing on the side of pitches watching his son play hockey.",
      "He says this was a chance to \"totally recharge physically and mentally\", and insists that even after 27 years at Westminster and Holyrood he is absolutely up for another seven years in high office.",
      "That will require the support of voters - and it will need to be overwhelming support if Mr Swinney is to achieve his ultimate political goal, of Scottish independence.",
      "The constitutional question, so vital for the past decade, seems becalmed after the general election result.",
      "That defeat followed one in the Supreme Court, which meant the levers which could trigger independence seem largely outwith the first minister's hands.",
      "After years of head-scratching about ways to force the issue, Mr Swinney insists he doesn't want to get \"bogged down in process\".",
      "But some within the movement remain concerned that means there is no plan, no route map to follow through to independence.",
      "After years of talk of \"de facto referendums\" and complex solutions, Mr Swinney says there is a \"hard reality\" - \"independence will not come about unless enough folk in Scotland want it to happen\".",
      "He says he is focused on delivering good government, to make the case that Holyrood is capable of running its own affairs.",
      "And that is a task that Mr Swinney insists he is not just enjoying, but \"loving\" every moment of."

      "Prices in the UK went up by 2.6% in the 12 months to November, the highest level for eight months.",
      "It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for two months in a row.",
      "The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%.",
      "What is inflation?",
      "Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time.",
      "For example, if a bottle of milk costs \u00a31 but is \u00a31.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%.",
      "How is the UK's inflation rate measured?",
      "The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "This virtual \"basket of goods\" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with vinyl records and air fryers added in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed.",
      "The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation.",
      "The main inflation measure is called the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), external, and the latest figure is published every month.",
      "CPI rose by 2.6% in the year to November 2024, up from 2.3% in the 12 months to October. The November figure is the highest rate since March 2024.",
      "This was largely as a result of increased fuel and clothing prices.",
      "Why are prices still rising?",
      "Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.",
      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",
      "Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices.",

      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",
      "The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.",
      "For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.",
      "Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.",
      "What has happened to UK interest rates?",
      "The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and again to 4.75% in November.",
      "As expected, it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.",
      "Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October.",
      "In October, the Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it could be a \"bit more aggressive\" at cutting borrowing costs, if inflation remained under control.",
      "However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - including an increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers - would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices.",
      "Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Bailey said the path for rates would likely be \"downward from here\" but warned cuts would be gradual.",
      "After the December meeting, he said \"a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right\", but added \"with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year.\"",

      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",

      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",

      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",

      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",
      "Local authorities wouldn't get a say in how many houses they have to build, after areas were given targets. But they would get a say in how to manage housing growth in their region, helping identify areas for building and making decisions on affordable housing.",
      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",
      "And mayors would be able to intervene in planning applications they see to be strategically important to an area - similar to the government saying they'll intervene in applications that are strategically important to the whole country, like prisons.",

      "Local communities currently have a right to bid for local community assets that are at risk of being lost.",

      "The prime minister, his cabinet colleagues and nearly all their political rivals agree that this trade must end. People from all over the world risk their lives to try and get here - and hundreds of communities are affected when those who make it are sent to live in hotels or other accommodation while their cases are dealt with.",
      "But there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
      "Labour replaced Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan with its own three word mantra: \"smash the gangs\". One of Sir Keir Starmer's first acts was to ditch the Conservatives' plan to send people who arrived in the UK without permission straight to Rwanda.",
      "Conservatives fume that Labour got rid of what might, theoretically, have stopped smugglers and migrants in their tracks. Frankly, we don't even know if the first plane would have left the tarmac, and Conservatives can't be sure that it would have worked as a deterrent \u2013 but the government can't be sure that it wouldn't have.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will be on our show on Sunday morning, has instead concentrated on trying to do deals with other countries to stop the criminals who exploit the distress and ambition of those desperate to come to the UK. This weekend we're with her in Italy as she brokers more cooperation with other governments.",
      "The jargon is to \"disrupt at source\", to hamper the gangs, and cut the number of people who get into flimsy rubber boats in the cold seas in the hope of making it to the UK.",
      "There's been no shortage of activity. The measures agreed so far range from the UK paying to help train border security forces in Iraq to a new criminal offence being created to prosecute people smugglers in Germany. There have also been deals with Slovakia, Slovenia, and Kurdistan, as well as cash for Sudan, Chad, Vietnam, and Egypt.",
      "She's also focused on speeding up the system that decides what happens to those who make it here and are living in a horrible limbo, and on returning more people back home. For years the backlog of cases has run to the tens of thousands \u2013 an unhappy status quo.",

      "So the overall approach is pretty clear: make it harder for people to get here without permission, and sort out what happens to those who do much faster.",
      "But clear is not the same as effective.",
      "Since Labour's been in power the number of people making the crossing in small boats has gone up. More than 20,000 have arrived since July, up from 17,000 in the same period last year. And the government has admitted that the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers has also risen since the election, to more than 35,000 people as of September.",
      "The government is well aware of the unhappiness this causes to some of the public, seeing migrants \"walk on to the coast like they're getting ferries\", one insider says. And there is acknowledgement that this hotel housing causes a \"major problem with social cohesion\", says the same source.",
      "It's not unheard of for Labour MPs and even some now ministers to object publicly to groups of new arrivals, who aren't allowed to work, being put up at the taxpayers' expense in communities without the right support or infrastructure, and without full explanation or support for local people either.",
      "But ending the use of these hotels has become one of the promises Labour made during the election that is proving harder than they suggested to keep.",
      "Cooper's team, though, point to increasing number of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries, and progress they have made in cutting the backlog of cases stuck in the system.",
      "Neither stopping using hotels nor specifically cutting migration numbers or stopping the boats have made it on to Sir Keir's very public list of \"milestones\". Never fear, say sources in his operation \u2013 it's not a milestone but a \"foundation\". What on earth does that mean? In short, the government is well aware of how important it is that it gets a grip on illegal immigration and sources suggest the PM himself is spending a lot of time concentrating on it, and that it's on the agenda with every world leader he sees.",
      "But No 10 won't repeat the practice of previous administrations, creating specific targets or setting lofty goals on immigration. Maybe it's trap they won't set for themselves.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "That lack of a visible measure of success, however, leaves the government open to accusations that they are not taking the public's concern seriously enough. If there are targets for health, why not immigration? If there are numbers for kids' education, why not boats?",
      "With Nigel Farage's Reform Party on the march in some polls, Labour's opponents are on the hunt for any sniff of a lack of commitment to making immigration a top concern. The Conservatives fume that Labour gave up the chance of a deterrent that may or may not have prevented cross channel journeys taking place. They cite Australia, where boats were turned around and Belgium, where police have intercepted boats in the water.",
      "One Tory strategist said there has been a \"lack of political will\" to solve the problem. The economy relies on migration, so gearing up the government machine to confront legal and illegal immigration requires a more fundamental level of honesty about the trade-offs that are needed, they say.",
      "The criticism comes from inside Labour itself, too.",
      "\"There's a fear, a lack of courage,\" one source in the party tells me \u2013 with others describing Cooper as cautious. The only way to solve the hideous problem of vulnerable people arriving into the UK in a chaotic manner would be to do something entirely different, some argue, such as opening up more safe routes for people to come to the UK or developing so-called humanitarian visas to help those in danger flee their countries (although that wouldn't necessarily stop others making the dangerous small boats journey).",
      "Sir Keir's leadership does not want to argue that it should be easier for people in desperately poor countries to move to the UK. Yet there are Labour voices who say a more grown up and honest conversation is required. Last year, I spoke to five former home secretaries about how hard it was to manage immigration, and they all felt they'd been hampered by the politics of the issue.",
      "Labour, right now, does not want to pick a bolder deterrent, like the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, or a more radical humanitarian approach. As so often, Sir Keir is picking what seems a pragmatic tack \u2013 do reasonable things better, and hope (like hell) that with enough effort, it works.",
      "It is, critics on the right and left say, a muddle in the middle.",
      "As 2025 approaches there is little doubt about the importance or the political emotion that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration. But nothing's obvious about the viability of the government's solutions \u2013 or the success or failure of what they are trying to do.",

      "The UK has joined a trade pact with several countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Japan and Australia.",
      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",
      "But ultimately it could yield considerable rewards.",

    "summary": "They include a neolithic burial mound in Wiltshire and an Iron Age hill fort on the edge of Dartmoor.",
    "story": [
      "Walkers and history-lovers have no easy way to visit more than a quarter of England's most ancient countryside landmarks because they are on private land with no legal rights of access, according to research by campaigners.",
      "A report by the Right to Roam group has found that more than 5,500 lesser-known sites designated as Scheduled Monuments have no direct footpaths to them or are not on open access land.",
      "The Stone Club, a group for neolithic stone enthusiasts, said its members often had to trespass to access sites.",
      "Government advisors Historic England said landowners were not obliged to open such sites to the public, although many do give permission on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Scheduled monument sites identified by Right to Roam campaigners as having no existing legal rights of way to them include hillforts, holy wells, henges and ancient burial mounds known as barrows.",
      "Scheduled monuments are nationally important archaeological sites, both above and below ground, that have been selected by the government for legal protection in a similar way to 'listed' buildings.",
      "This list of 19,966  is kept and maintained by Historic England.",
      "It includes monuments and sites that can be accessed, ranging from the ancient Avebury henge and stone circles in Wiltshire and the Sutton Hoo burial site in Suffolk to the world's first purpose-built motor racing circuit in Surrey.",
      "But among the 5,500 sites identified by Right to Roam as having no basic legal right of direct public access are the East Kennett long barrow in Wiltshire, a neolithic burial mound first protected as a scheduled monument in 1924, and the Holne Chase Iron Age hill fort in woodland on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon.",
      "While scheduling means a private landowner needs consent to carry out any works to a protected site, it does not affect their ownership nor give the general public any new rights of access beyond existing footpaths.",
      "However, the owners of the East Kennett site told the BBC that they were happy for people to visit with permission, as safety was an issue when horse training took place nearby.",
      "The owner of the Holne Chase site has been approached by the BBC for comment.",
      "The countryside charity CPRE, formerly known as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said it believed Right to Roam's estimate of sites without a legal right of access was \"likely a significant underestimate\".",
      "That, it said, was because the report excluded sites that may not have direct access but were within 20m of a road or footpath and could therefore be viewed from a distance, such as the Devil's Arrows stone circle in North Yorkshire.",
      "CPRE president Mary-Ann Ochota said the public should have a legal right of \"responsible access\" to ancient landmarks as \"peering over a fence isn't enough\".",
      "Meanwhile, the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents rural landowners, said many of the sites identified \"face constant threats - from motorbikes to metal detectors - and are too fragile to survive unchecked access\".",
      "\"Open them up, and we could lose them forever,\" its president, Victoria Vyvyan, explained.",
      "She called for more funding for farmers to provide \"controlled, guided\" access and to better protect scheduled monuments on their land.",
      "'Celebrate history'",
      "Right to Roam campaigner Amy-Jane Beer said ancient sites needed to be accessible as they \"connect us with our past and enrich our experience of the countryside\".",
      "The group is calling for a change in the law to bring England in line with Scotland where, since 2003, there has existed a right of responsible access to most land.",
      "Matthew Shaw, of the Stone Club, added: \"Sites which are visited often have active groups caring for them - maintaining access, ensuring the stones are well looked after and liaising with the landowner.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said the purpose of scheduling monuments was to preserve them for future generations and does not create new rights of public access.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:36:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

    "story": [
      "The government and regulators have broken the law by being too lenient on water companies that spill sewage, the UK's environment watchdog has found.",
      "The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) said sewage releases should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as during unusually heavy rainfall, but that \"this has not always been the case\".",
      "It acknowledged that regulator Ofwat had now taken steps to change the way it implemented the law. The government and the Environment Agency are carefully \"considering the allegations\" but failure to accept them could result in legal action.",
      "Campaigners welcomed the findings but called it a \"bittersweet moment\".",

      "\"The OEP's findings offer yet another devastating verdict of the total failure of environmental regulation in our country,\" said chair and founder of River Action Charles Watson. \"It is nothing short of scandalous.\"",
      "Sewage sometimes needs to be released when it is raining to prevent a build-up of wastewater in the system and sewage flowing back into people's homes.",
      "But two years ago the wildlife charity WildFish complained to the OEP that the Conservative government, and the regulators - Ofwat and the Environment Agency (EA) - were allowing excessive releases. It argued that according to the law sewage should only be released under \"exceptional circumstances\", such as unusually heavy rain, rather than any wet weather.",
      "Untreated sewage contains chemicals which can be harmful to aquatic life and can lead to a build-up of algae which starves local wildlife of oxygen and produces toxins that are potentially fatal to pets and dangerous to people.",

      "But the government's environment department, Defra, and the Environment Agency are currently consulting on any changes, and have said they would \"carefully consider\" the OEP's allegations.",
      "A Defra spokesperson said: \"For too long, water companies have pumped record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas. In just five months, this government has acted decisively to refresh outdated guidance to make extremely clear our expectations around storm overflows.\"",

      "The announcement follows a public consultation in August.",

      "A spokesperson for WaterUK, the industry body, told the BBC: \"While regulators argue among themselves about what they think the rules are, water companies plan to deliver the world's biggest ever programme to end sewage entering rivers.",

    "summary": "Climate change could increase flood threats without improvements to defences, the Environment Agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",
      "Currently, 6.3 million properties are considered at risk from flooding, new figures show, which is higher than previously thought.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties",
      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",
      "Partly thanks to the Thames Barrier flood defence, for example, London is currently considered less at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea than some other regions.",
      "But there have been repeated warnings that the UK is poorly prepared for the impacts of a changing climate.",
      "Earlier this year, a cross-party committee of MPs warned that the government had not maintained enough of its existing flood defences or built enough new ones. A lack of funding has been a key issue.",
      "In response to today's report, Floods Minister Emma Hardy acknowledged that \"too many communities are exposed to the dangers of flooding\".",

      "The US government is taking action against the app because of what it says are its links to the Chinese state - links which TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have denied.",
      "The Supreme Court justices did not act on a request by TikTok for an emergency injunction against the law, but will instead allow TikTok and ByteDance to make their case on 10 January - nine days before the ban is due to take effect.",
      "Earlier in December, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the legislation, saying it was \"the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\".",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "The Supreme Court is the highest legal authority in the US, and the decision to take on TikTok's case is significant as it only hears 100 or so cases a year out of the more than 7,000 petitions it receives.",
      "TikTok had previously argued that the attempt to ban it was unconstitutional because it would impact the free speech of its users in the country.",
      "TikTok said Wednesday it was pleased with the Supreme Court's order.",
      "\"We believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC.",
      "The appeal sets up a clash between free speech and national security, according to University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",
      "\"The appeals court found that national security was stronger than the First Amendment contentions. However, the Justices will scrutinize the potentially conflicting, but significant, values,\" Mr Tobias said in an email.",
      "While it is difficult to predict the outcome, Cornell professor Sarah Kreps said it would be surprising to the court to overturn the prior rulings and go against the wills of both congress and the White House.",
      "\"The case has already gone through the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the lower court, all of which upheld the argument that TikTok's ownership by China-based ByteDance poses a national security risk,\" Dr Kreps said.",
      "Will Trump intervene?",
      "TikTok's future does not just hang on the legal process, however - Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election may also hand it a lifeline.",
      "He met TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported, citing sources familiar with the meeting.",
      "Trump has publicly said he opposes the ban, despite supporting one in his first term as president.",
      "But he will not take office until 20 January, the day after the deadline for TikTok to be banned or sold.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,\" he claimed at a press conference on Monday - though a majority of 18 to 29-year-olds backed his opponent Kamala Harris.",
      "\"There are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that,\" he said.",
      "But despite Trump's support, senior Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, urged the Supreme Court to reject TikTok's bid.",
      "In a brief filed to the court, he called the firm's arguments \"meritless and unsound.\"",
      "TikTok has the backing of some civil liberties organisations however.",
      "A group of them have made a joint filing to the court urging it to block the banning of a platform which they argue \"millions use every day to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves.\"",
      "Kelsey Chickering from market research firm Forrester said Instagram's parent company Meta would be a major beneficiary of ban on TikTok.",
      "\"TikTok is central to a thriving creator economy, and a ban would effectively create a Meta monopoly on short-form video,\" Ms Chickering said, citing a Forrester survey that found 56% of TikTok users would switch to Instagram Reels in that event."

    "summary": "Palestinian news outlets have seen a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Wattan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",
      "\"But in spite of the challenges, the risks, and the content bans,\" he says,\"we must continue sharing Palestinian content.\"",

      "This is the third feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Ovarian cancer is \u201crare, underfunded, and deadly\", says Audra Moran, head of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (Ocra), a global charity based in New York.",
      "Like all cancers, the earlier it is detected the better.",
      "Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too.",
      "\"Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,\" says Ms Moran.",
      "But new blood tests are emerging that use the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to spot signs of the cancer in its very early stages.",
      "And it's not just cancer, AI can also speed up other blood tests for potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.",
      "Dr Daniel Heller is a biomedical engineer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.",
      "His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.",
      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",
      "In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.",
      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",

      "And much of even that data is siloed in hospitals that treated them, with minimal data sharing for researchers.",
      "Dr Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few 100 patients as a \"Hail Mary pass\".",
      "But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try.",
      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",
      "Dr Heller has high hopes for the tech.",
      "\"What we'd like to do is triage all gynaecological disease - so when someone comes in with a complaint, can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it's more likely to be a cancer or not, or this cancer than that.\"",

      "It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.",
      "For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection.",
      "But new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process.",
      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",
      "\u201cBefore our test, a patient with pneumonia would have 15 to 20 different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital - that's about $20,000 in testing,\u201d says Karius chief executive Alec Ford.",
      "Karius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points. Test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen.",
      "Mr Ford says that would have been impossible without AI.",
      "One challenge is that researchers don\u2019t necessarily currently understand all the connections that an AI might make between the test biomarkers and the diseases.",
      "Over the last two years Dr Slav\u00e9 Petrovski has developed an AI platform called Milton that, using biomarkers in the UK biobank data to identify 120 diseases with a success rate of over 90%.",
      "Finding patterns in such a mass of data is only something that AI can do.",
      "\u201cThese are often complex patterns, where there may not be one biomarker, but you have to take into consideration the whole pattern,\u201d says Dr Petrovski, whose is a researcher at pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca.",
      "Dr Heller uses a similar pattern matching technique in his work on ovarian cancer.",
      "\"We know that the sensor binds and responds to proteins and small molecules in the blood, but we don't know which of the proteins or molecules are specific to cancer,\" he says.",
      "More broadly data, or the lack of it, is still a drawback.",

      "Earlier this week, Seoul, Washington and Kyiv said the soldiers had now entered the fight \"in significant numbers\", and reported the first casualties, with South Korean officials estimating more than 100 had already been killed and more injured. This figure has not been confirmed.",

    "story": [
      "US immigration authorities last year deported the largest number of undocumented immigrants in nearly a decade, surpassing the record of Donald Trump's first term in office.",
      "More than 271,000 immigrants were deported from the US over the last fiscal year, according to a report released by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on Thursday.",
      "The ICE report comes just weeks before President-elect Trump, who plans to make mass deportation a cornerstone of his incoming administration, takes office.",
      "President Joe Biden in 2021 had pledged to pause deportations, but his administration ended up expanding it following a surge in border crossings.",
      "In the newly released report, ICE said the steep climb in deportations last fiscal year was partly the result of a streamlined process.",
      "More deportations flights went to further away destinations, including Africa and Asia, which did not accept US deportations for years, the agency said.",
      "A majority of the deportations in fiscal year 2024 involved migrants apprehended by border officials compared to those ICE arrested in the US interior.",
      "Roughly 82% of the 271,000 immigrants deported that year were arrested by border agents.",
      "President-elect  Trump has vowed to launch the \"largest deportation operation in history\" when he returns to office on 20 January.",
      "These promises, however, are likely to face enormous logistical and financial challenges.",
      "Leading up to his decisive victory over Biden in November, Trump spent much of the time on the campaign trail attacking the White House's border policies.",
      "Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Reuters that Biden's deportations were insignificant compared to the high levels of illegal immigration during his presidency.",
      "\"On day one, President Trump will fix the immigration and national security nightmare that Joe Biden created by launching the largest mass deportation operation of illegal criminals in United States history,\" she said.",
      "The number of migrant encounters along the US-Mexico border reached a record high in December 2023, but have dropped significantly, particularly in the last few months, and are now at their lowest level since July 2020, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).",
      "It also attributed the rise in deportations to improved diplomatic efforts convincing countries to take back more deportees.",
      "Mexican authorities have also increasingly been clamping down on the flow of migrants headed north to the US border.",
      "In June, President Biden issued an executive order that sharply limited asylum which along with Mexico's help led to a decrease in illegal border crossings.",
      "Since then, the number of individuals released by the US Border Patrol pending immigration court proceedings is down 70%, the agency said."

    "story": [
      "Eight people accused of abetting the jihadist murder of French teacher Samuel Paty are to learn their fate after a six-week trial in a Paris court.",
      "They include the father of a schoolgirl whose lie about Paty's alleged discrimination against Muslims in the classroom set in motion the chain of events which led to his beheading on a street in October 2020.",
      "Also on trial are a Muslim activist who led an online campaign against Paty, two boyhood friends of Chechen-born killer Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped him acquire weapons, and four radicalised men with whom he exchanged messages on social media.",
      "Anzorov was shot dead by police minutes after killing the 47 year-old history-geography teacher outside his secondary school in the Paris suburb of Conflans-Saint-Honorine.",
      "He was fired up by claims circulating on the internet that a few days earlier Paty had ordered Muslims to leave his class of 13-year-olds before revealing obscene pictures of the prophet Muhammad.",
      "In fact Paty had been conducting a lesson on freedom of speech, and before showing one of the controversial images first published by Charlie Hebdo magazine, he advised pupils to avert their eyes if they feared being offended.",
      "The schoolgirl, named as Z. Chnina, had not even been in class when this happened, but told her father she had been punished for raising an objection.",
      "The trial has centred on legal arguments over whether people who in advance had no knowledge of the attack \u2013 or in some cases even of its perpetrator \u2013 could by their words nonetheless be guilty of \"terrorist association\".",
      "Summing up in court this week, prosecution lawyers asked for jail terms of between 18 months suspended and 16 years for the accused, saying their actions had indirectly led to the atrocity.",
      "However, the prosecution had also angered members of Paty's family by refusing to push for maximum sentences, and by downgrading the qualification of some of the imputed crimes.",
      "During the trial, the court heard the first public testimony from the girl, Z. Chnina, now aged 17.",
      "A year ago she was given a short suspended sentence for slander by a juvenile court, whose hearings were conducted behind closed doors.",
      "\"I want to apologise to all the [Paty family] because were it not for my lies they would not be here today,\" she said, in sobs.",
      "\"And I want to apologise to my father because when he made the video it was partly because of my lie.\"",
      "In the days following Paty's freedom-of-speech class, her father Brahim Chnina made videos denouncing the teacher by name. He also enlisted the help of activist Abdelhakim Sefrioui to spread the campaign through his social media network.",
      "French headteacher describes spiral of events that led to teacher's beheading",
      "Six French teenagers on trial over teacher's murder",
      "Chnina and Sefrioui never called for action against Paty, and they were unaware of the existence of Anzorov until the killing took place.",
      "But for the prosecution they were nonetheless guilty of \"terrorist association\", because they knew of the possible consequences of their campaign.",
      "\"No-one is saying they wanted the death of Samuel Paty, but in lighting 1,000 digital fuses they knew that one of them would lead to jihadist violence against the teacher,\" according to prosecution's submission.",
      "The context in October 2020 was one of heightened tensions over jihadist violence, after Charlie Hebdo republished some of the controversial Muhammad cartoons.   Five years earlier most of the staff of the magazine had been murdered in a jihadist gun attack at their Paris office.",
      "This week in court the longest jail terms were requested for the two friends of Anzorov who accompanied him when he bought a knife and a fake gun. One of them also drove Anzorov to the school on the afternoon of the attack.",
      "Neither of these defendants is a radicalised Muslim, and it was not established in court that they knew of Anzorov's plans.",
      "That was why the prosecution downgraded the charge against them from \"complicity in a terrorist attack\" which carries a possible life sentence.",
      "The four other accused are people with whom Anzorov conversed on chatlines, again without him ever revealing his intention to kill Paty.",
      "One of these, a convert to Islam called Priscilla Mangel, admitted making \"provocative\" remarks online about the Paty case but said she would never have made them had she known Anzorov's intentions.",
      "\"For me this was an anodyne discussion with an anonymous person.\"",
      "For defence lawyers, none of the accused would have faced criminal proceedings for what they said, had it not been for the murder of Paty.",
      "So the key legal question facing the court is whether utterances can become illegal depending on what follows."

    "story": [
      "Poland has accused Hungary of acting in a hostile manner by granting political asylum to a former Polish deputy justice minister accused of defrauding the state.",
      "Marcin Romanowski, 48, is facing 11 charges in Poland, including defrauding or attempting to defraud $40m (\u00a332m; \u20ac39m) from a justice fund meant to help victims of crime when he served as deputy justice minister under the previous Law and Justice-led government between 2019 and 2023.",
      "\"We consider the decision of Viktor Orban's government to grant political asylum to M.Romanowski, a suspect in criminal offences and wanted under a European Arrest Warrant, to be an act hostile to the Republic of Poland and the principles of the European Union,\" Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on X on Thursday night.",
      "\"Tomorrow we will announce our decisions.\"",
      "On Friday, the foreign ministry said it was summoning Hungary's ambassador to the country and would request the European Commission to launch proceedings against Budapest if it fails to fulfil its EU obligations.",
      "Mr Romanowski was responsible for the justice fund under the previous government that lost power in 2023's election.",
      "An audit found that only 40% of the funds' resources went to crime victims and former prisoner rehabilitation, and that contracts were issued at the minister's discretion without due competitive process.",
      "Mr Romanowski denies the charges.",
      "He fled to Hungary, saying he would not receive a fair trial in his homeland because of politicised prosecutors and judges under Poland's current pro-EU coalition government under Prime Minister Donald Tusk.",
      "Such reasoning was mocked by governing officials given that the Law and Justice-led government Mr Romanowski served in was widely condemned by international judicial bodies, the European Commission and European courts for introducing reform that politicised the judiciary.",
      "Mr Tusk's government is trying to undo that reform because it created a two-tier judicial system of judges appointed under Law and Justice and older judges, some of whom do not recognise the new judges because they consider their appointments unlawful.",
      "Law and Justice and Mr Romanowski have accused the current government of making illegal judicial appointments in its efforts to undo that reform.",
      "Until Thursday night, the 48-year-old opposition MP had not been seen for almost two weeks.",
      "He reportedly had not used his phones or bank cards since 6 December and failed to attend a court hearing three days later that ruled he be remanded in custody before trial.",
      "On Thursday, a European Arrest Warrant was issued by a Warsaw court acting on prosecutors' information he had fled to an EU country.",
      "There had been speculation that Mr Romanowski was in hiding in Hungary.",
      "On Thursday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the current Polish government was treating Hungary as an enemy and he would offer refuge to anyone facing political persecution in Poland.",
      "Mr Orban and Poland's Law and Justice party share ideological goals even though they fell out over Russia's invasion and war against Ukraine.",
      "They broadly agree that what they consider a liberal EU-elite is driving Europe away from its Christian traditions and eroding member states' sovereignty.",
      "Mr Romanowski is reportedly a member of conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, who issued a denial earlier this week that the MP was being hidden by them.",
      "In October 2022, he told a Polish Catholic radio station that LGBT+ was \"institutionalised deviancy\".",

    "summary": "Putin tells an end-of-year press conference there should have been \"systemic preparation\" for the full-scale invasion.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia should have launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier and been better prepared for the war.",
      "In his end-of-year press conference on Thursday, Putin said, with hindsight, there should have been \"systemic preparation\" for the 2022 invasion, which he refers to as a \"special military operation\".",
      "Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and pro-Russian forces began a conflict in eastern Ukraine, but it was eight years later that Putin tried to seize Kyiv.",
      "During his four-hour long appearance, Putin also talked about Syria's deposed leader, Russia's more aggressive nuclear doctrine as well as domestic issues, like the price of butter.",
      "Billed as \"Results of the Year with Vladimir Putin\", the event was broadcast live across the main state TV channels on Thursday.",
      "Putin appeared in front of a large blue screen emblazoned with a map of the Russian Federation, complete with annexed parts of Ukraine.",
      "He took questions from members of the public, foreign journalists and pensioners - but it was a highly choreographed and tightly controlled affair.",
      "When asked by the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg whether he felt the country was in a better state than where his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, had left it 25 years ago, Putin said Russia had regained its \"sovereignty\".",
      "\"With everything that was happening to Russia before that, we were heading towards a complete, total loss of our sovereignty.\"",
      "Asked about the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Putin insisted it was not a defeat for the Kremlin - which supported President Bashar al-Assad militarily for years - but he admitted the situation was \"complicated\".",
      "He said he had not yet spoken to ousted Syrian leader, who fled to Moscow as rebel forces closed in on Damascus earlier this month, but planned to do so soon.",
      "He added that Russia was in talks with Syria's new rulers to retain two strategically important military bases on the Mediterranean coast and that Moscow would consider using them for humanitarian purposes.",
      "On US President-elect Donald Trump, Putin said the pair had not spoken in four years, but he was ready to meet him \"if he wants it\".",
      "When put to him he was in a weak position compared to Trump, who is set to take office in January, Putin quoted American writer Mark Twain: \"The rumours of my death are much exaggerated,\" prompting a smattering of laughs in the conference hall.",
      "Moving on to China, Putin said Russia's relations with its eastern neighbour had reached an all-time high and the two countries were coordinating actions on the world stage.",
      "\"In the last decade, the level and quality of our [Russia-China] relations have reached a point that has never existed throughout our entire history, \" he said.",
      "A lengthy portion of the session was focused on the war in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was \"open to compromises\" to end the war - although it was unclear what such compromises could entail.",
      "Russian forces are making progress on the frontlines \"everyday\", he said, describing his troops as \"heroes\".",
      "At one point, he produced a signed flag he said was given to him by Russian marines who were \"fighting for the motherland\" in the Kursk region, and ushered two observers to hold it behind him for the cameras.",
      "He also talked up Russia's construction projects in areas it has seized from Ukraine, claiming the standard of roads in the Ukrainian region of Luhansk had greatly improved since it was seized by Russia-backed forces in 2014.",
      "When asked by an audience member if the West had \"received the message\" on Russia's change to its nuclear doctrine, which Putin pushed through in November, he said \"you'll have to ask them.\"",
      "The new nuclear doctrine allows Russia to conduct a nuclear strike on any country, if it is backed by a nuclear power.",
      "That means if Ukraine were to launch a large attack on Russia with conventional missiles, drones or aircraft, that could meet the criteria for a nuclear response, as could an attack on Belarus or any critical threat to Russia's sovereignty.",
      "Putin also emphasised the capabilities of Russia's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, which was used in a strike on Ukraine in November.",
      "In order to test its power, he suggested Russia should fire the Oreshnik towards Ukraine, and Ukrainian air defence - using US-supplied systems - should try to bring it down.",
      "As for the name \"Oreshnik\"? \"Honestly,\" Putin said with a smirk, \"No idea. No clue.\"",
      "A dominant theme throughout the event was \"Russian sovereignty\", with Putin claiming that less reliance on international partners - partly a result of Western sanctions - was one of the key achievements of his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "He said the economy was \"stable\", pointing to higher growth than countries like Germany, but admitted inflation of 9.1% was \"alarming\".",
      "In fact, the economy is overheating and highly reliant on military production - sometimes termed the \"military industrial complex\".",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:28:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Nelson Amenya is hailed as a hero in Kenya after sharing details of a plan to lease the main airport.",
    "story": [
      "Kenyan business student Nelson Amenya has been hailed as a hero by those campaigning for greater transparency in the deals his government makes with private firms.",
      "Recent Kenyan history is littered with stories of huge contracts that have resulted from corruption \u2013 and despite laws that are supposed to prevent this from happening, there are suspicions that it continues to take place.",
      "Thirty-year-old Mr Amenya, who is studying in France for an MBA, leaked details on social media of what he said was a proposed agreement between Kenya and the Adani Group, an Indian multinational, in July.",
      "It concerned the management of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) \u2013 the country's - and region's - biggest airport, which is long overdue a complete overhaul.",
      "\"The first feeling I had [when I was passed the documents] was that it was just another government deal\u2026 I did not understand the magnitude or the seriousness of it,\" Mr Amenya, whose profile as an anti-corruption activist had been on the rise, tells the BBC.",
      "The documents detailed a $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) proposal by the Adani Group to lease JKIA for 30 years in order to modernise and run it.",
      "As he started to go through the papers, he felt that if it was to go ahead, it \"was going to hurt the Kenyan economy\" while all the benefit would go to the Indian multinational.",
      "The deal appeared unfair to him, according to what he read, as Kenya would still be putting in the largest share of the money but not reaping the financial rewards.",
      "Mr Amenya had good reason to think the papers were genuine as \"the people who were giving me these documents were from very legitimate departments of government\", he says.",
      "The Adani Group is involved in infrastructure, mining and energy projects globally, in countries such as Israel, the UAE, France, Tanzania, Australia and Greece. Its founder Gautam Adani is a big player in India's economy and is a close ally of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "Through further reading, Mr Amenya says he discovered that the Adani deal with Kenya could have left his country with an obligation to pay the company if it did not recoup its investment.",
      "\"This was a great breach of trust of the people by the leadership of the president, the Kenya Airports Authority, the minister - they all betrayed the people,\" he alleges.",
      "Despite the evidence in his hands, Mr Amenya wrestled with what to do next. His own safety was at risk, though being in France he was better off than being in Kenya, where anti-corruption activists have been targeted and some killed.",
      "\"I was a bit scared. I didn't know what's going to happen. I'm risking my career, I'm risking my life, why should I take the risk to do this?\" he asked himself at the time.",
      "However, in the end he felt that staying quiet was not an option.",
      "\"You know, it's only cowards who live long.\"",
      "After spending weeks going through what he had been sent, Mr Amenya leaked the documents on his X page in July, immediately sparking outrage in Kenya.",
      "JKIA airport workers went on strike demanding that the deal be scrapped.",
      "\"It felt like a duty for me, for my country. Even if I am far away, I still have a duty for my country. I want to see a better Kenya, my home country becoming developed, industrialised and an end to corruption.\"",
      "He worried that the airport deal was a harbinger of what might come next.",
      "Mr Amenya says it was not just the unusual terms and lack of transparency that rang alarm bells, it was also, he alleges, that Kenyan laws appeared to have been systematically ignored.",
      "\"[The authorities] never did due diligence for this company\u2026 they did not follow the due process of procurement.\"",
      "He alleges that some government officials hoped to bypass the legal requirements, including public consultation, that are supposed to prevent taxpayers' money from being misspent.",
      "A report in April by the Kenya Airports Authority on the proposed deal highlighted that there was no plan to consult stakeholders on the plan.",
      "\"This was in April, and by July when I was exposing this, they had not done any public participation. It was quite secret this deal, and by that time they were just a month away from signing the deal,\" Mr Amenya alleges.",
      "\"After I exposed this deal is when they hurriedly tried to come and do like a sham public participation - they called the Kenya Airports Authority staff and started to have stakeholder meetings.\"",
      "Various officials and branches of the state denied allegations of corruption in the process and the authorities went ahead to sign another multimillion dollar deal with the Adani Group \u2013 this time to construct power lines.",
      "The Adani Group said Mr Amenya's claims were baseless and malicious.",
      "A spokesperson told the BBC that \"the proposal was submitted following Kenyan Public Private Partnership regulations and was intended to create a world class airport and significantly enhance the Kenyan economy by creating numerous new jobs\".",
      "The Adani Group further says that no contract was signed as \"discussions did not progress to a binding agreement\".",
      "The company also says the proposal for the energy deal was above board and that the company \"categorically refutes all allegations and insinuations of any violation of Kenyan laws in our operations or proposals.",
      "\"Every project we undertake is governed by a strong commitment to compliance, transparency and the laws of the respective countries in which we operate,\" the statement read.",
      "But it was not Mr Amenya's leak that actually changed the government's mind.",
      "It was only when the US authorities indicted Gautam Adani for alleged involvement in a $250m (\u00a3200m) bribery scheme that Kenya acted.",
      "Representatives from the Adani Group denied the allegations from US prosecutors and called them \"baseless\".",
      "At a state-of-the-nation address in parliament last month, Kenya's President William Ruto announced the cancellation of both Adani deals.",
      "\"In the face of undisputed evidence or credible information on corruption, I will not hesitate to take decisive action,\" Ruto said in a speech met with loud cheers inside parliament.",
      "Kenyans celebrated the decision which Ruto attributed to new information provided by investigative agencies and partner nations.",
      "\"I was in class when this announcement came. I couldn't believe it,\" Mr Amenya says.",
      "\"I think in the first one hour, I had tears in my eyes. I was so happy.\"",
      "Although he does not see himself as a hero, messages of support poured in from everywhere, including from India.",
      "Forty minutes after the class ended, he posted his now-famous tweet \"Adios Adani!!\" - goodbye Adani.",
      "\"It was momentous\u2026 All that I did finally paid off.\"",
      "The feeling of triumph, however, came after months of personal struggle and pressure.",
      "Soon after exposing the airport deal, Mr Amenya was sued for defamation by an Adani Group representative and a Kenyan politician, making him question whether he should continue.",
      "\"Some people were coming to me from the government, they were even ready to pay me, they were telling me: 'You need to cash out and just stop this fight with the government,'\" he recalls.",
      "\"It would have been the biggest mistake of my life to give up, a betrayal to the Kenyan people.\"",
      "But even after scrapping the deals, President Ruto still questions why Kenyans opposed this and many other projects he has championed. He says he will find a way to upgrade the airport.",
      "\"I saw them saying that those who stopped the upgrading of our airport are heroes. Heroes? What do you gain when you stop the building of an airport in your country?\" Ruto asked at a public function in early December.",
      "\"You have no clue how it's going to be built, and those who are opposed have never even stepped foot inside an airport, you just want to oppose.\"",
      "Mr Amenya, who is still facing the defamation cases, is now fundraising to help with his legal fees, and says his future in Kenya is uncertain.",
      "\"I have received threats from credible intelligence agencies and people in Kenya that have warned me not to go back because obviously there's some people who are very angry with what I did,\" he says.",
      "A hefty price, but one Mr Amenya says he would gladly pay again.",
      "\"We don't really need to wait for someone to save us,\" he says.",

      "Syria's rebel leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has dismissed the online controversy over videos showing him gesturing to a young woman to cover her hair before he posed for a photo with her last week.",
      "The incident sparked criticism from both liberal and conservative commentators amid intense speculation about the county's future direction after rebels swept to power.",
      "Liberals saw the request from the head of the Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a sign that he might seek to enforce an Islamic system in Syria after leading the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, while hardline conservatives criticised him for consenting to be photographed with the woman in the first place.",
      "\"I did not force her. But it's my personal freedom. I want photos taken for me the way that suits me,\" Sharaa said in an interview with the BBC's Jeremy Bowen.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:56:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The ex-husband - who is under investigation for other attacks - has a divided personality, a doctor finds.",
    "story": [
      "It was something in Dominique Pelicot's swagger, his \"\u00e9lan\" - as the French might put it - that immediately struck the psychiatrist as odd.",
      "There he stood. A 68-year-old pensioner who had already spent several months inside one of France's most notorious prisons, Les Baumettes in Marseilles. The prison was a grim, intimidating place, crowded with members of the port city's warring drug gangs.",
      "And yet the man in the visiting room who rose to greet Dr Laurent Layet on a cold day in February 2021 seemed \"clean, polished\u2026 He had just cut his own hair. He came towards me with this assertive attitude.\" Dr Layet was surprised, to put it mildly.",
      "The psychiatrist was the first of many people to scrutinise Dominique Pelicot. Each expert was looking for clues to explain how this apparently genial pensioner could have committed such grotesque crimes and deceived his unsuspecting victim for so long.",
      "In all his years interviewing hundreds of rapists and suspected rapists on behalf of French police and prosecutors, Dr Layet had never come across anyone quite like this grey-haired former electrician, calmly awaiting prosecution for drugging his wife Gisele and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her as she lay, unconscious, in the couple's bedroom.",
      "\"Something didn't fit. I had never encountered such an exceptional case,\" Dr Layet remembers thinking at the time.",
      "At the end of a gruelling, four-month trial that has enraged people across France and far beyond - even as they were inspired by the dignity and courage of Gisele - Dominique Pelicot's confident demeanour, a grandiose presence in the courtroom in Avignon, remained intact.",
      "One might expect a man in Pelicot's position - a globally reviled sexual predator, and rapist, facing the near-certain prospect of dying in prison - to cut a wretched figure. And there have been a handful of brief moments when he wept, openly, in court - usually for himself.",
      "But for the most part, he struck an imperious pose, courtroom microphone in one hand, his body slouched in a throne-like chair (to accommodate the accused's health issues), sometimes looking bored, occasionally interjecting like a ringmaster seeking to keep an unruly circus - the 50 other men on trial beside him - in their place.",
      "\"I am a rapist, like the others in this room. They knew everything,\" he intoned, speaking with the confidence of a man who assumed his words would put an end to all further discussion.",
      "But what are we to make of that domineering performance? And what have we really learned of this jowly, grey-haired figure, with his black cane and scarf, seated in a glass cage; this serial rapist whose cruelty has almost been eclipsed in the public imagination by the dignity and courage shown by his former wife?",
      "Dr Layet first encountered Dominique in the late summer of 2020 at a police station in the nearby town of Carpentras, immediately after his arrest for filming with a camera up women's skirts in a local supermarket. Called in to assess Pelicot, Dr Layet noted how breezily he dismissed his crime, like a genteel grandfather caught pocketing a few cigarettes.",
      "Dr Layet detected a \"dissonance\" in the man's behaviour, and the strong implication that he was hiding something more serious. He told the police that this one was worth closer inspection.",
      "In court, years later, after two long prison interviews with Pelicot and with more than 20 of the other accused, Dr Layet presented a more detailed assessment to the panel of judges.",
      "A measured and eloquent expert witness, Dr Layet stressed that Pelicot exhibited no signs of severe mental illness. He could not be dismissed as a \"monster\". Nor was he psychotic - unable to tell reality from fiction.",
      "And yet. There was a \"fissure\", a split, in Pelicot's personality.",
      "A showier witness might have borrowed from popular culture to compare him to a tormented Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or perhaps to Hannibal Lecter, stiff-backed in his prison cell in The Silence of the Lambs.",
      "Instead, Dr Layet reached for a mundane image.",
      "\"Almost like a hard drive,\" he suggested. A fitting metaphor, given that Pelicot had stored video evidence of his crimes on a computer memory card.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: How an ordinary woman shook attitudes to rape in France",
      "Who are the men convicted in the Gis\u00e8le Pelicot rape trial?",
      "Here's what you need to know about the Pelicot trial",
      "Later, in an interview with the BBC at his office in Carpentras, Dr Layet explained that Pelicot's mind had become divided, over time, like a partitioned computer disk, into two entirely separate \"water-tight parts\u2026 with no leakage between them. His split personality is very effective and very solid. We either have the 'normal Mr Pelicot' or the other Mr Pelicot at night, in the bedroom.\"",
      "Asked in court to explain that \"other\" Pelicot, Dr Layet said that he had detected a range of emotional and sexual abnormalities. They are, perhaps, most neatly captured in their original French, in a prosecution document seen by the BBC:",
      "\"Egocentrisme, fragilite narcissique, perturbations emotionnelles\u2026 une deviance paraphilique melant candaulisme, voyeurism et somnophilie.\"",
      "\"Egomania, narcissistic fragility, emotional disorders... an abnormal sexual deviancy combining candaulism [exposing your female partner to others for sexual enjoyment], voyeurism and somnophilia.\"",
      "Pelicot's own defence lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, enthusiastically embraced the \"split\" personality theory in her closing arguments at the trial. She suggested that the charming young man Gisele Pelicot had fallen in love with and quickly married back in 1973 \"was not the man that had harmed her\".",
      "But that is not what Dr Layet - or the other psychiatrists we have consulted for this article - meant.",
      "There may be two sides to Pelicot's behaviour, but there is - to stick with Dr Layet's computing metaphor - only one operating system that controls his cruel, private urges and his public demeanour.",
      "A simpler way of putting it is that Pelicot has an antisocial personality disorder - a term preferred by psychiatrists these days to words such as psychopath or sociopath. Several experts have concluded it is a reasonable diagnosis to use in the context of Pelicot's warped mind.",
      "He is not \"mad\" - he cannot claim diminished responsibility for his actions. But he does show well-established traits of a personality disorder characterised by a lack of empathy towards other humans. Those traits may have been sharpened by the sexual abuse he experienced as a child.",
      "Which brings us to another key question. Did Pelicot only become a rapist in retirement, or was he preying on women long before he began drugging his wife?",
      "Sitting towards the back of the courtroom one Tuesday afternoon late in the trial, surrounded by journalists tapping away on their laptops, Florence Rault looked at Dominique Pelicot with a particularly well-informed sense of disgust.",
      "\"It can be assumed that what happened in Mazan\u2026 is only the culmination of a long process,\" she said later, in a BBC interview.",
      "Ms Rault, a lawyer specialising in criminal cases, knew something deeply troubling about Pelicot - allegations of appalling crimes arguably more disturbing than those for which he was about to be convicted.",
      "For many years, she had been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s.",
      "More than 20 years before the rapes for which he has now been sentenced - in 1999 - Pelicot is accused of assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris. She fought the attacker off.",
      "He eventually admitted to being present at the scene in 2021 after DNA - a spot of blood on the victim's shoe - was finally found to match Pelicot's. But he continues to deny he attempted to rape her and the investigation continues.",
      "\"Once he was told that his DNA was found at the crime scene, he said 'Yes, it's me,'\" Ms Rault remembered.",
      "And that discovery quickly led to a link to an even older cold case. In 1991, another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, had been raped and murdered. Although crucial DNA evidence had gone missing, the similarities between the scenes were so striking that Pelicot is under investigation for the crime, which he denies. The search for other potential links to older crimes is also ongoing.",
      "If you've been affected by issues of sexual abuse, information and support is available at BBC Action Line.",
      "Ms Rault is not expecting any more confessions from Pelicot in relation to the cold cases.",
      "\"Until he's confronted with indisputable proof, he will deny [everything],\" said Ms Rault, who once sat beside Pelicot at a hearing and was struck, like Dr Layet, by his \"relaxed, rather serene\" demeanour.",
      "Ms Rault now watched him in the Avignon courtroom and saw the same behaviour. She also noted how Pelicot emphatically and tearfully denied drugging and raping his own daughter, Caroline, despite having taken deeply troubling photos of her, asleep, and without her knowledge.",
      "\"She's convinced that he sexually abused her too. But since we don't have any formal evidence like DNA to put in front of him, of course he will continue to deny it,\" said Rault, arguing that, for Caroline, the agony of uncertainty was as cruel and traumatic as the suffering of a victim who knew exactly what had happened to her.",
      "Pelicot's attitude towards his family in court was often revealing. The psychiatrist, Dr Layet, pointed out that the accused narcissistically focused on the love his wife and children once felt for him, not his betrayal of their trust.",
      "For Pelicot, this \"started out as a love story\" and he \"doesn't want this to be ignored\", said Dr Layet.",
      "But Ms Rault had come to court to look for other signs. Above all, she wanted to shore up her sense that Pelicot's crimes were highly premeditated.",
      "\"Serial rapists\u2026 usually have an impulse. They commit rape. They leave, and then they forget. This is not the case with [Pelicot] at all,\" she said.",
      "Ms Rault recalled the methodical actions of Marion's attacker inside an estate agent's office in 1999. The way he had made an excuse to return to his car - almost certainly to collect a rope and a bottle of ether to drug her. Then Ms Rault noted that the man in the glass cage in Avignon demonstrated a similar self-possession and saw it as further evidence that this was a deeply calculating criminal.",
      "\"When he says he has urges and acts on impulse, it's nothing like that. He is very calm.\"",
      "On the same day that Ms Rault was in the Avignon courtroom, I was sitting nearby. Gisele Pelicot was a few metres to our right. Dozens of the accused sat in front of us. Dominique Pelicot was over to the left side of the room.",
      "During a break in proceedings, I walked over to him. According to French law, journalists are not allowed to talk to the accused. Instead, I stood for a while and watched him as he sat in his chair, behind his glass wall, one hand on his stick. Then his head turned towards me, and he held my gaze for what must have been 20 seconds - although it felt much longer.",
      "His expression did not change. He did not seem to blink. And then, like a bored man switching between equally boring television channels, he looked away."

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:12:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC hears how roofs flew off homes as people sheltered inside in the cyclone-hit French territory.",
    "story": [
      "On the night Cyclone Chido hit the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, Zinedine was in his home, a small house made of corrugated iron and wood where he lives with eight of his relatives.",
      "Zinedine had received a warning from the authorities about the cyclone, but he didn't take it too seriously.",
      "\"I thought it was like in previous years when they warned that a cyclone was coming but it would just be a bit of rain. So we stayed home.\"",
      "This time however the island was about to be hit by winds of more than 124mph (200km/h) - the strongest cyclone to hit the island in almost a century",
      "So far 31 people are known to have died, according to French officials, and thousands more feared missing.",
      "When another, more urgent cyclone warning came through, Zinedine swung into action.",
      "\"I told my mum it's never happened before that they send a message like this so I think this time it's serious.\"",
      "He suggested they go to their neighbours' place, a bricks and mortar house not far from his, in a poor neighbourhood high up in the hills of Mayotte's Petite Terre, the smaller of its two islands.",
      "But his mum didn't want to go, and he felt he had to stay home with his family. The 20-year-old tourism student is the eldest boy in his family and feels responsible for them.",
      "When the storm started, he and his mum hid his younger siblings under a table. Then there was a loud noise.",
      "\"The iron roofing of our house flew off. We panicked and looked for shelter. There were iron sheets, wood and other big objects flying everywhere.\"",
      "He took his siblings to the neighbour's hut when he turned around he noticed his mum hadn't followed.",
      "\"I decided to go back outside to get my mother even though it was dangerous with the wind and everything. I'd rather die than leave my mum to die.\"",
      "His mother stood in the middle of their damaged house holding a one-year-old baby. She was terrified and wouldn't let the baby go. Zinedine snatched him from her arms and ran to give him to the neighbours. He eventually had to carry his mother out of the house.",
      "\"Luckily we're all safe but we've lost everything. The only things we were able to save were our papers and diplomas.\"",
      "Now he's trying to rebuild his family's home. Finding new building materials is incredibly difficult in Mayotte at the moment due to high demand, and he couldn't afford new roofing for his house so he tracked down some of the corrugated iron sheets that were blown off by the storm and plans to re-use them.",
      "\"I'm trying to do what I can. Even though I'm not a builder, I want to do it myself because I don't know if the authorities will help us.\"",
      "All across Mayotte, others like Zinedine are attempting to do the same, the sound of hammers ringing late into the night.",
      "But as resourceful as the people of Mayotte are, they're also angry at the lack of support they say they've received from the government.",
      "During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the islands on Thursday, he was booed whilst trying to make a speech. As he visited a hospital, frustrated staff complained of being overwhelmed.",
      "Most of the people we spoke to when in Mayotte were yet to receive any state aid, five days after the cyclone.",
      "\"We've only received food donations from volunteers who've also given us clothes and water. The mayor's office tried to help a bit but that's it\" says 18-year-old mother-of-three Yasmine Moussa.",
      "She took her three boys, the youngest of whom is just three months old, to the closest shelter, a secondary school in the neighbourhood of Labattoir, shortly after receiving the storm warning on Friday afternoon.",
      "\"On the day of the cyclone my children were crying because of the noise. When we  looked outside we saw corrugated iron roofs flying everywhere. They kept asking me what was happening, why everything was breaking,\" she said.",
      "\"I said to them it's just wind and rain but the next day when they saw everything was destroyed. They couldn't sleep that night.\"",
      "When she headed back home, she could hardly recognise her own neighbourhood.",
      "\"Mango trees had fallen during the storm and were blocking the roads. My neighbour had to point my house out to me because I couldn't even spot it. There was water everywhere, the toilet was broken, my TV, everything was ruined. I tried to save what I could.",
      "\"I was in tears, I never imagined this would happen.\"",
      "Now she has nowhere else to go. She says the conditions in the shelter are decent but she needs a house to take her children to. They now sleep on mattresses in one of the school's classrooms with a dozen other families.",
      "\"It's not normal to sleep like this. The doors don't lock and sometimes strangers walk in. I worry for my children's safety and that they will try to steal from us.\"",
      "The Red Cross told the BBC there are at least 100,000 people in shelters around Mayotte.",
      "President Macron has promised compensation for the uninsured, who make up the majority of the population, but he hasn't said how much they'll get.",
      "The needs are huge: almost all of the islands have to be rebuilt. But some on the political right in France argue that spending too much money in Mayotte will only encourage more undocumented migrants to come to the French territory.",

    "summary": "Kurdish forces say there's a real threat IS militants will try to break out comrades held in their jails in the north east.",
    "story": [
      "As the new Syria struggles to take shape, old threats are re-emerging.",
      "The chaos since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad is \"paving the way\" for the so-called Islamic State (IS) to make a comeback, according to a leading Kurdish commander who helped defeat the jihadist group in Syria in 2019. He says the comeback has already begun.",
      "\"Activity by Daesh [IS] has increased significantly, and the danger of a resurgence had doubled', according to General Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a mainly Kurdish militia alliance backed by the US. \"They now have more capabilities and more opportunities.\"",
      "He says that IS militants have seized some arms and ammunition left behind by Syrian regime troops, according to intelligence reports.",
      "And he warns there is \"a real threat\" that the militants will try to break into SDF-run prisons here in north-east Syria, which are holding about 10,000 of their men. The SDF is also holding about 50,000 of their family members in camps.",
      "Our interview with the general was late at night, at a location we can't disclose.",
      "He welcomed the fall of the Assad regime - which detained him four times. But he looked weary and admitted to frustration at the prospect of fighting old battles once again.",
      "\"We fought against them [IS] and paid 12,000 souls,\" he said, referring to the SDF's losses. \"I think at some level we will have to go back to where we were before.\"",
      "The risk of an IS resurgence is heightened, he says, because the SDF is coming under increasing attacks from neighbouring Turkey - and rebel factions it supports - and must divert some fighters to that battle.   He tells us the SDF has had to stop counter terrorism operations against IS, and hundreds of prison guards - from a force of thousands - have returned home to defend their villages.",
      "Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the PKK - banned Kurdish separatists who have waged an insurgency for decades, and are classed as terrorists by the US, and the EU. Turkey has long wanted a 30km \"buffer zone\" in the Kurdish region in northeastern Syria. Since Assad's fall, it is pushing harder to get it.",
      "\"The number one threat is now Turkey because its airstrikes are killing our forces,\" said General Abdi. \"These attacks must stop, because they are distracting us from focusing on the security of the detention centres,\" he said, \"though we will always do our best.\"",
      "Inside Al-Sina, the largest prison for IS detainees, we saw the layers of security and felt the tension among the staff.",
      "The former educational institute in the city of Al-Hasakah holds about 5,000 men - suspected fighters or supporters of IS.",
      "Every cell door is padlocked and secured with three bolts. The corridors are divided into sections by heavy iron gates. The guards are masked, with batons in hand. Getting access here is rare.",
      "We were allowed a glimpse inside two cells but could not speak to the men inside. They were told we were journalists and were given the option of hiding their faces. Few did. Most sat silently on blankets and thin mattresses. Two men paced the floor.",
      "Kurdish security sources say most of the prisoners in Al-Sina were with IS until its last stand and were deeply committed to its ideology.",
      "We were taken to meet a 28-year-old detainee - thin and softly spoken - who did not want to be named. He said he was speaking freely, though on the key issues he wouldn't say much.",
      "He told us he left his native Australia at the age of 19, to visit his grandmother in Cyprus.",
      "\"From there, one thing led to another,\" he said, \"and I ended up in Aleppo.\" He claimed he was working with an NGO in the city of Raqqa when IS took over.",
      "I asked if he had blood on his hands, and was involved with killing anyone? \"No, I wasn't,\" he replied, barely audibly.",
      "And did he support what IS was doing? \"I don't wish to answer that question because it might have an effect on my case,\" he replied.",
      "He hopes to get back to Australia one day, though he's unsure if he will be welcome.",
      "About three hours drive from Al-Sina, behind the wire of Roj camp, many believe that freedom is coming. Somehow.",
      "This bleak expanse of tents - ringed by walls, fences and watch towers - is home to almost 3,000 women and children. They have never been tried or convicted but they are the families of IS fighters and supporters.",
      "There are several British women in the camp. We met three of them, briefly.  All said they had been told by their lawyers not to speak.",
      "In a windswept corner we came across a woman willing to talk - Saida Temirbulatova, 47, a former tax inspector from Dagestan. Her nine-year-old son, Ali, stood quietly by her side. She hopes the overthrow of Assad will mean freedom for them both.",
      "\"The new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa [the head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham] made an address, saying he will give everyone their freedom. We also want freedom. We want to leave, most likely for Russia. It's the only country that will take us.\"",
      "The camp manager tells us that others believe IS will come to their rescue and break them out. She asked us not to use her name as she fears for her safety.",
      "\"Since the fall of Assad, the camp is calm. Typically, when it's this quiet, it means the women are organising themselves,\" she said. \"They have packed their bags ready to go. They say: 'We will get out of this camp soon and renew ourselves. We will come back again as IS.'\"",
      "She says there's a visible change, even in the children, who chant slogans and swear at passersby. \"They say: 'We will come back and get you. It [IS] is coming soon.'\"",
      "During our time in the camp many children raised the index finger of their right hands. This gesture is used by all Muslims in daily prayer, but it's also widely used by IS militants.",
      "The women in Roj camp aren't the only ones packing their bags.",
      "Some Kurdish civilians in the city of Al-Hasakah are doing the same - fearing a comeback by the jihadis and another ground offensive by Turkey in north-eastern Syria. This would be the fourth invasion by Turkish forces. It's expected soon.",

    "title": "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 01:39:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The rebel offensive that ended Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule has left Syria facing an uncertain future",
    "story": [
      "Last week, while touring Damascus, Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) was approached by a young woman who asked for a photo with him. He gently requested that she cover her hair before taking the picture.",
      "The incident quickly sparked heated debate across Arabic social and mainstream media.",
      "What happened may have been small but it was telling because it encapsulated the tightrope that Syria's new rulers Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - who are designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK - must walk.",
      "On one side is the diverse, and, in some cases more liberal, Syrian population, along with the international community, whose acceptance is crucial for HTS's survival and legitimacy. To them, the hair covering incident offered a troubling glimpse into Syria's potential future under HTS, expressing fears that conservative policies could eventually mandate the veil for all women.",
      "On the other side, Islamist hardliners criticised al-Sharaa for taking the photo at all, describing the woman as a \"mutabarijah\" - a term for a woman perceived to dress immodestly or wear makeup - and insisting his action violated religious rules.",
      "These hardliners hold significant sway over militant factions and could rally opposition within al-Sharaa's own Islamist base.",
      "HTS faces the challenge of attempting to reconcile these competing demands - balancing the expectations of the international community and the liberal parts of Syria's population with the demands of the hardline base. Both sides are closely scrutinising HTS's every statement and action.",
      "The group's ability to navigate these tensions will be critical to maintaining control and pursuing its political ambitions.",
      "In his messages, he has focused on coexistence within Syria's diverse society, granted amnesty to former military conscripts, prohibited acts of vigilante revenge against ex-government personnel and loyalists, and adopted neutral and at times conciliatory language when addressing traditional adversaries, including Israel, the US, Iran and Russia.",
      "His statements have been deliberately devoid of inflammatory rhetoric or threats, instead centring on themes of reconciliation, stability, and reconstruction, in a clear effort to neutralise opposition and push for the removal of HTS and al-Sharaa himself from international terror lists.",
      "Significant unease",
      "It is still unclear whether al-Sharaa's flexible approach represents a genuine ideological shift or a calculated strategy aimed at winning approval and consolidating power before potentially implementing a stricter and more religiously conservative agenda.",
      "But already his more progressive moves are sparking significant unease among hardliners in Syria, who insist on an Islamist government rooted in a strict and distinctive Sunni identity. While Sunni Arabs are the dominant ethnic and religious group in Syria, the country is notably diverse, with a range of minority groups including Shia Alawites, of which the ousted president Bashar al-Assad is a member, Kurds, Christians, Druze, Turkmen and Ismailis, in addition to other small groups.",
      "Even if HTS leadership is sincere in its push for change, the diverse range of Islamist and jihadist factions deeply entrenched in Syria - many of which played key roles in the recent offensive - are unlikely to tolerate anything short of a strict Islamist system. Should HTS deviate from such a path, these factions would likely be prepared to resort to armed resistance to enforce their vision.",
      "However this is not a new challenge for HTS.",
      "From IS to al-Qaeda to HTS",
      "For a decade the group, formerly known as al-Nusra Front and with roots in transnational jihadist movements, has been evolving.",
      "HTS transitioned from being a covert offshoot of the ultra-hardline IS around 2011 and 2012, to being affiliated to the relatively more flexible al-Qaeda the following year, and by 2016 to an independent faction.",
      "It consolidated its control of Idlib province in north-west Syria in 2017, running a civilian \"government\" in the area purportedly with no lasting jihadist connections or ambitions.",
      "This evolution reflects al-Sharaa's strategic vision and likely incorporates elements of opportunism and pragmatism aimed at ensuring the group's acceptance and long-term survival. HTS's strategy of signalling that it poses no external threat has already borne fruit.",
      "While its former jihadist partners, al-Qaeda and IS, were heavily targeted in Syria by the US-led coalition - resulting in the routine assassination of their leaders, often in Idlib itself - al-Sharaa has operated with relative freedom.",
      "Despite a $10m (\u00a37.8m) US bounty on his head, he has been able to frequently appear publicly, attending events and engaging with the population, much like a statesman.",
      "However, al-Sharaa's jihadist critics accuse him of being a manipulative politician, willing to compromise on key ideological principles to advance his own career and secure political gains for HTS, at the expense of other militant groups operating in the country.",
      "How rebels won hearts and minds",
      "HTS solidified its authority in Idlib through a dual strategy: winning the hearts and minds of local populations through offering some form of stability, while using force to stamp out or co-opt rivals and even former allies.",
      "The group moved away from distinctive jihadist rhetoric, fighting for religion, and the establishment of Islamic rule (Sharia) in Syria, as part of a wider interconnected global project. Instead, they adopted a more \"revolutionary\" and nationalist narrative, focusing on the singular goal of toppling Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and \"liberating\" Syria.",
      "The civilian front established by HTS in 2017 to administer Idlib was called the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG). The aim was to demonstrate HTS's governance capabilities, and bolster its legitimacy. This move was likely also aimed at alleviating fears about militants running a province, seeking to distance itself from the brutal image associated with IS's rule over territories in Syria and Iraq.",
      "The SSG operated as a mini-state, complete with a prime minister, ministries and local departments managing key sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, all while adhering to a religious council guided by Sharia (Islamic law). It also established professional-looking military and police academies, frequently showcasing their graduation ceremonies and organising military parades, typically attended by al-Sharaa.",
      "The SSG frequently showcased its achievements in reconstruction and service provision. It often contrasted these efforts with the dire conditions and rampant corruption in areas controlled by the Syrian government or rival rebel groups. Al-Sharaa even twice attended Idlib's annual book fair, giving speeches.",
      "But HTS faced significant challenges in Idlib, and its rule was far from smooth.",
      "Prior to the 27 November HTS-led rebel offensive, the group was dogged by anti-HTS protests, particularly targeting al-Sharaa's leadership. Protesters accused HTS of suppressing dissent through forced disappearances and imprisonment of opponents and critics.",
      "The group also faced criticism for allegedly colluding with foreign powers to undermine \"the jihad\" in Syria. In 2023, it was further rocked by a scandal involving spies within its top leadership, and was accused by hardliners of deliberately avoiding meaningful combat against government forces to please unnamed foreign backers.",
      "During such protests, al-Sharaa was frequently likened to Assad, while HTS's security apparatus was compared to the \"Shabiha\", Assad's notorious loyalist militia.",
      "However, it is important to note that many of HTS's critics, past and present, and some of the those imprisoned by the group, were hardliners actively inciting opposition to HTS's project in Idlib. Others were locals and activists who criticised what they described as HTS's monopolisation of power and \"authoritarian\" rule.",
      "Hardliners vs liberals: Religious restrictions",
      "Although some locals have voiced complaints about religious restrictions in Idlib, as reported by Arab media and NGOs, these grievances have not been widespread. This may be due to HTS's relative flexibility and the fact that most residents of the province are conservative Sunni Muslims who may be generally accepting of the status quo.",
      "Indeed, HTS has often come in for harsh criticism by hardliners for being too \"lenient\" and failing to impose strict Sharia rules in Idlib.",
      "Al-Sharaa has argued that the imposition of strict rules such as the morality police is an outdated idea that often causes more harm than good. In April 2023 he said: \"We don't want to create a hypocritical society that prays when we're around and doesn't when we're gone.\" He emphasised that he wanted people to adhere to Islamic teachings out of conviction, \"not through the stick [force]\".",
      "Despite these comments, the group has often responded by employing strict measures in a clear effort to appease hardliners - a pattern that offers insight into how HTS may respond to such pressures in future.",
      "For example, despite dissolving various Hisba (morality police) structures that operated under thinly-veiled names and despite the vocal objections of al-Sharaa himself, the SSG nevertheless established a \"public morality police\" under its Ministry of Interior in early 2024.",
      "These morality forces regulated shops, ensured women wore compliant religious clothing and limited the mixing of sexes in public spaces.",
      "And a few months earlier, the SSG's Ministry of Education had issued a decree mandating that all female students and staff wear \"loose Islamic dress that complies with Sharia\", which includes covering one's hair and avoiding \"fashion and trends\" deemed \"incompatible with our religious teachings\". The decree also prohibited the mixing of sexes in primary and secondary schools.",
      "Other rebel rivalries",
      "Until recently, the dominant feature of Syria's opposition groups - whether rebel or jihadist - was disunity and fragmentation, often marked by bouts of infighting. Armed factions competed over territory, revenue sources, authority and ideology.",
      "For years, this persistent disunity, among other factors, severely hampered their ability to achieve victory over Assad.",
      "The recent rebel unity that led to Assad's downfall remains a relatively new development and could still prove fragile. Also, there are internal challenges still posed by rival factions.",
      "HTS has long had a strained relationship with the other major rebel bloc in Syria, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The SNA's focus during the recent offensive has largely aligned with Ankara's priorities - seizing Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria to eliminate what Turkey perceives as a Kurdish \"threat\" along its borders.",
      "Whether the two blocs can agree on the division of the strategic locations seized from Kurdish forces - or across Syria more broadly - remains uncertain, particularly as HTS continues to push for complete unity, clearly under its own leadership.",
      "IS, which remains active in Syria through both operatives and sleeper cells, has declared its ongoing jihad in the country and denounced the HTS-led rebel authority as \"apostates\" allegedly brought to power by \"infidel\" forces.",
      "With the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakening in the northeast, IS is likely to set its sights on the prisons and camps in Hasaka that hold IS-linked fighters and their families. A mass release or escape from these facilities could significantly bolster IS's ranks and ability to destabilise Syria.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011 - and Assad's brutal crackdown on the uprising - the country has attracted a wide range of foreign fighters, clerics and transnational jihadist groups, facilitated by porous borders, particularly via Turkey.",
      "To consolidate its control over Idlib, and possibly as part of deals with foreign powers to contain the jihadist threat in northern Syria, HTS crushed some local and foreign factions and co-opted others, integrating them into its own structures, renaming their units to obscure their foreign origins. These include smaller factions from Central Asia, the Caucasus (Chechens) and China's Uighur minority.",
      "Many of these smaller factions, including independent jihadist groups like Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Tawhid, actively participated in the latest offensive, which highlights their potential vested interest in shaping the future of the new Syria.",
      "In terms of post-Assad messaging, groups like al-Qaeda as well as more moderate Islamist figures and scholars have reminded HTS about its \"obligation\" to ensure the set-up of an Islamic system in Syria, distinguished by a strong Sunni identity.",
      "'Power grab'",
      "When asked by a CNN correspondent on 6 December whether HTS intends to impose an Islamic system, al-Sharaa gave a characteristically evasive response. Instead of a direct \"yes\" or \"no\", he stated, \"People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\"",
      "This carefully worded answer suggest that HTS likely plans to implement Islamic governance, but perhaps in a more flexible and nuanced form.",
      "But already since HTS toppled the Assad government, ideological tensions have begun to resurface after the initial euphoria and unified effort to achieve a common goal. On 9 December HTS issued a decree granting amnesty to former military conscripts, but hardliners in Syria denounced the move as overly \"lenient\" and inconsistent with Sharia law, going so far as to incite disobedience and call for revenge attacks against ex-government loyalists, directly defying the HTS order.",

      "HTS attempted to quell the uproar by issuing a statement clarifying that it would pursue former government personnel and loyalists implicated in war crimes - an apparent attempt to appease critics. At the same time, HTS sought to reinforce its authority, explicitly vowing to punish anyone who defied its decree by engaging in vigilante revenge.",
      "Another point of contention arose on 16 December when al-Sharaa announced plans to disband and disarm militant groups and militias in the country, concentrating weapons in the hands of the state and the military alone.",
      "Again, hardliners protested, urging factions to retain their arms. They argued the move would consolidate power under HTS, leaving no other groups armed to challenge its authority and paving the way for tyranny.",
      "Further discontent emerged over HTS's muted response to repeated Israeli airstrikes in Syria following Assad's fall. After days of silence, on 14 December al-Sharaa criticised the strikes but stated that his group had no intention of engaging in any new conflicts, emphasising its current focus on rebuilding Syria. He also stated that he would not allow Syria to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.",
      "Some viewed this stance as weak and a betrayal of Islamist principles. Their frustration was amplified by al-Qaeda's recent message urging HTS to prioritise the fight against Israel and fulfil its \"obligation\" to defend Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "These tensions suggest that hardliners - both within HTS ranks and external factions - may be willing to take up arms against the group if they perceive it as straying too far from their vision for a new religious Syria.",
      "Many of these individuals and factions are deeply invested in the country and are unlikely to relinquish their ambitions easily. They view Syria, much like Afghanistan under the Taliban, as a project for a strong Sunni Islamic state - one that could wield regional influence while serving as a safe haven for persecuted Muslims and jihadist fugitives.",
      "Under pressure from liberals and hardliners alike, al-Sharaa and HTS are treading a fine line in an attempt not to antagonise either side too much and the need for flexibility appears to be key.",

    "summary": "Leaked intelligence from military spies is helping turn the civil war in the resistance\u2019s favour, BBC finds.",
    "story": [
      "The once formidable Myanmar military is cracking from within - riddled with spies secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels, the BBC has found.",
      "The military only has full control of less than a quarter of Myanmar's territory, a BBC World Service investigation reveals.",
      "The junta still controls the major cities and remains \"extremely dangerous\" according to the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar. But it has lost significant territory over the past 12 months - see map below.",
      "The soldier spies are known as \"Watermelons\" - green on the outside, rebel red within. Outwardly loyal to the military but secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels whose symbolic colour is red.",
      "A major based in central Myanmar says it was the military's brutality that prompted him to switch sides.",
      "\"I saw the bodies of tortured civilians. I shed tears,\" says Kyaw [not his real name]. \"How can they be so cruel against our own people? We are meant to protect civilians, but now we're killing people. It's no longer an army, it's a force that terrorises.\"",
      "More than 20,000 people have been detained and thousands killed, the UN says, since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021 - triggering an uprising.",
      "Kyaw initially thought about defecting from the army, but decided with his wife that becoming a spy was \"the best way to serve the revolution\".",
      "When he judges it safe to do so, he leaks internal military information to the People's Defense Forces [PDF] - a network of civilian militia groups. The rebels use the intelligence to mount ambushes on the military or to avoid attacks. Kyaw also sends them some of his wage, so they can buy weapons.",
      "Spies like him are helping the resistance achieve what was once unthinkable.",
      "The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November this year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict.",
      "The investigation reveals that ethnic armies and a patchwork of resistance groups now control 42% of the country's land mass. Much of the remaining area is contested.",
      "The military now controls less than at any time since they first took control of the country in 1962, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled).",
      "Co-ordinated operations between ethnic armies and civilian militia groups have put the military on the back foot.",
      "After heavy territorial losses earlier this year Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing made a rare admission that his forces were under pressure.",
      "The leaked Watermelon intelligence from within the military is helping to tip the balance. Two years ago, the resistance set up a specialised unit to manage the growing network of spies and to recruit more.",
      "Agents like Win Aung [not his real name] collect the Watermelon leaks, verify them where possible, and then pass them on to the rebel leaders in the relevant area.",
      "He is a former intelligence officer who defected to the resistance after the coup. He says they are now getting new Watermelons every week and social media is a key recruitment tool.",
      "Their spies, he says, range from low-ranking soldiers to high-ranking officers. They also claim to have Watermelons in the military government - \"from the ministries down to village heads\".",
      "They are put through a strict verification process to ensure they are not double agents.",
      "Motivations for becoming a spy vary. While in Kyaw's case it was anger, for a man we are calling \"Moe\" - a corporal in the navy - it was simply a desire to survive for his young family.",
      "His wife, pregnant at the time, pushed him to do so, convinced the military was losing and he would die in battle.",
      "He began leaking information to the Watermelon unit about weapons and troop movements.",
      "This kind of intelligence is crucial, says pro-democracy rebel leader Daeva.",
      "The ultimate goal of his resistance unit is to take control of Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city and his former home. But they are a long way off.",
      "The military retains the majority of major urban areas - home to crucial infrastructure and revenue.",
      "\"It's easier said than done to attack and occupy [Yangon], Daeva says. \"The enemy will not give up on [it] easily.\"",
      "Unable to physically penetrate the city, Daeva from his jungle base directs targeted attacks by underground cells in Yangon using Watermelon intelligence.",
      "In August, we witnessed him making one such call. We were not given the details but were told it was to direct an assassination attempt on a colonel.",
      "\"We will do it inside the enemy's security parameters,\" he told them. \"Be careful, the enemy is losing in every direction,\" he added, telling them that this meant they were more likely to be on alert for infiltrators and spies.",
      "Daeva says several major attacks by his unit have been the result of tip-offs.",
      "\"We started with nothing and now look at our success,\" says Daeva.",
      "But it comes at a cost. Watermelons have to live in fear of both sides, as navy corporal-turned spy Moe discovered.",
      "Deployed from Yangon to Rakhine - a border region where the military is fighting an ethnic group siding with the resistance - he had to live with the terror that his intelligence could mean he himself was attacked.",
      "In March this year, his anchored ship was hit with a projectile missile, followed by open fire. \"There was no place to run. We were like rats in a cage.\" Seven of his fellow soldiers were killed in the rebel attack.",
      "\"Our ability to protect [the moles] is very limited,\" admits Win Aung. \"We can't publicly announce that they are Watermelons. And we can't stop our forces from attacking any particular military convoy.\"",
      "He says that when this is explained to the Watermelons, however, they do not falter. Some have even responded: \"When it comes to that moment, don't hesitate, shoot.\"",
      "Outside the UK, watch on YouTube",
      "But there are times when the spies can no longer bear the danger.",
      "When Moe was set to be sent to another dangerous front line, he asked the Watermelon unit to smuggle him out into a resistance-controlled area. They do this using an underground network of monasteries and safe houses.",
      "He left in the dead of night. The next morning, when he did not show up for duty, soldiers came round to the house. They interrogated his wife Cho, but she remained tight-lipped.",
      "After days on the run Moe arrived at one of Daeva's bases. Daeva thanked him over video call, before asking him what role he wanted to play now. Moe replied that, given his young family, he would like a non-combat role and would instead share his knowledge of military training.",
      "A few weeks later he crossed into Thailand. Cho and the children fled their home too and hope to eventually join him and build a new life there.",
      "The military is aggressively trying to reclaim lost territory, carrying out a wave of deadly bombings. With Chinese- and Russian-made fighter jets, it is in the air that it has the upper hand. It knows that the resistance is far from being one homogenous group and is seeking to exploit divisions between them.",
      "\"As the junta loses control, their brutality increases. It's getting worse. The loss of life\u2026 the brutality, the torture as they lose ground, literally and figuratively,\" says UN special rapporteur Tom Andrews.",
      "The military is also conducting sweeps for Watermelons.",
      "\"When I heard about the sweeps, I stopped for a while,\" says Kyaw. He says he always acts like a staunch supporter of the military to avoid unwanted attention.",
      "But he is scared and doesn't know how long he can stay hidden. Defecting is not an option, as he worries about abandoning his ageing parents, so for now, he will keep acting as a military spy, hoping to see a day when the revolution is over.",
      "If and when that day comes, Watermelons like Kyaw and Moe will not be forgotten, Win Aung vows.",
      "\"We will treat them with honor, and allow them to choose what they want to do next in their lives.\"",
      "The military did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "About the data:",
      "Researchers commissioned by the BBC questioned multiple sources from 12 February to 13 November 2024 for each of more than 14,000 village groups to assess the level of military control in their area.",
      "The names and boundaries of village groups were sourced from the Myanmar Information Management Unit, or MIMU, which is hosted by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).",
      "In every case, the research team spoke to at least one source with no official affiliation to the military or the opposition - such as academics, charity workers, journalists and local residents.",
      "When sources provided conflicting information for a village group, unaffiliated sources were prioritised and further cross-referenced with media reporting.",
      "Responses were divided into three possible categories of control:",
      "Military: The military is present and active in the region. It operates a local administration or provides certain public services, which are all functioning normally.Contested: The military is present in the region, but there are limits to its effective control. This could include areas where general administration and public services are not fully operational, or where the military divides administration with regional ethnic armed forces. It also covers areas where opposition forces can enter and exit, and where skirmishes between opposing forces occur.Resistance groups and ethnic armies: The military is largely absent and has not performed on-the-ground operations for more than three months. Civil services may be provided by resistance forces, ethnic armies or a civilian government, likely supported by a rebel armed militia.",

      "The group known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, was sweeping all before it, but I assumed that the regime would fight, as it did not stop doing as it was losing ground in the years before the Russians intervened in 2015 to bomb Syrian towns and villages to rubble.",
      "Almost a decade later, it was clear that Bashar al-Assad's Russian, Iranian and Lebanese allies had other wars to think about.",
      "But while the regime struggled with unwilling conscripts, it could always find Syrians who were prepared to fight and die for it, even at the height of the war after 2011, when rebels controlled much of Damascus outside the city centre and the road to Beirut.",
      "I visited those men on the front line many times.",
      "Many of the most effective units were led by officers from Assad's own Alawite community.",
      "In Aleppo in around 2015 an Alawite general handed out glasses of perfectly distilled arak, poured from bottles that once held Jack Daniels.",
      "Proudly, he said the arak, an aniseed based spirit popular across the Middle East, came from the Assad family's home town in the hills behind the port of Latakia. Outside, his unit was pounding the rebel-held east side of the city.",
      "Not all were Alawites. In Jobar, a district on the edge of central Damascus, a Christian officer loyal to Assad from the Syrian Arab Army took me into the tunnels they had dug under the ruins to attack rebels.",
      "He told how the rebels also had tunnels and how sometimes they would break into each other's, killing in the darkness.",
      "The young man had a crucifix tattooed on his wrist and another hanging around his neck, and he talked about how he had to fight to protect his community against jihadi extremists on the other side.",
      "My instincts about the fighting spirit of Assad's depleted band of loyalists could not have been more wrong.",
      "On Saturday 7 December I went to sleep after hearing the news that Homs had fallen.",
      "By the time I woke up Bashar al-Assad was on his way to Russia and rebel fighters were starting to celebrate on the streets of Damascus.",
      "They shot more bullets into the air in celebration than they fired in anger at Assad's loyalists, who were running for their lives.",
      "I saw hundreds of cars queuing to leave at the border with Lebanon, full of disgruntled, defeated men and frightened families.",
      "Rank and file soldiers dumped their uniforms and weapons without firing a shot and went home.",
      "The Assad regime crumpled, hollowed out by corruption, cruelty and brutal disdain for the lives of Syrians. Even Assad's own Alawite community did not fight for him.",
      "That was why on Thursday evening this week, instead of sheltering from shells and bullets on some freezing street in Homs or Hama, as I'd expected, I walked through the marble halls of the presidential palace in Damascus with Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria's de facto leader.",
      "He has given up his uniform, and swapped his wartime pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, for his real name.",
      "Many Syrians doubt his claim that he has also swapped his old jihadist beliefs for a more tolerant form of Syrian religious nationalism.",
      "It is true that he broke with al Qaeda in 2016, after a long career as a jihadist fighter in Iraq and Syria. But as I found in Assad's palace, Ahmed al-Sharaa, a tall, quietly spoken man in his early forties, is reluctant to get too specific about the Syria he wants.",
      "He comes across as highly intelligent and politically astute. Like many astute politicians, he often does not give a straight answer to a straight question.",
      "He denied he wanted Syria to become a Middle Eastern Afghanistan.",
      "The Taliban, he said, ruled \"a tribal society. Syria is entirely different.\" Syria's new rulers would respect its culture and history.",
      "When I asked whether women would have the freedoms they have come to expect here, he said 60 per cent of students in universities in Idlib, his powerbase, were female.",
      "But he tried not to answer a question about mandating hijab - Islamic dress - for women.",
      "Damascus has been buzzing with rumours of bearded HTS men ordering women to cover their hair.",

      "Al-Sharaa was referring to the fact that many Syrians, not just in the majority Sunni Muslim community, are pious.",
      "Many women wear hijab. The point, secular Syrians would say, is to be able to choose.",
      "In half a century of Assad rule, Syrians developed survival strategies which often included hiding their own feelings and doing what was expected of them.",
      "Shocked, nervous, secular Syrians showed me videos on their phones of mass prayers outside universities when the students went back last Sunday.",
      "Was it, they asked, real piety or young people doing as they were told because that is how it's been here for their whole lives?",
      "It will all, al-Sharaa said, be a matter for a new constitution to be decided by a panel of legal experts.",

      "Ahmed al-Sharaa wanted to talk most about the old regime's oppression of the people.",
      "\"The Syrian problems are far too bigger than the issues you are asking about. Half the population was kicked out of Syria or forcibly displaced from their houses.",

      "He recognised that Syria has no chance of starting to stabilise and rebuild if sanctions are not lifted.",
      "Sanctions were aimed originally at the Assad regime. To keep them, he said, meant treating the victim the same as the oppressor.",
      "He denied the group he leads is a terror organisation, which at the moment is the position of the UN and most of the world's strongest countries.",
      "Visits by foreign diplomats suggest changing both the sanctions and terrorist listings could be feasible.",
      "He was dismissive when I pointed out I knew diplomats had told him that changing that status would depend on proof he was keeping his promise to respect minority rights and run an inclusive political process.",

      "Judges in the French city of Avignon have sentenced Dominique Pelicot to 20 years in prison for aggravated rape after he drugged and abused his then wife, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, and invited dozens of strangers to rape her.",

      "For almost a decade, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was unknowingly given sedatives by her ex-husband, who has admitted to raping her and inviting men he had recruited online to have sex with her in her bed at home while she was unconscious and unaware.",
      "Although Dominique Pelicot admitted the charges against him, most of the other men on trial denied what they did was rape.",
      "It was Gis\u00e8le's decision to waive her anonymity and throw this trial into the open - in her words, making \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist - something which has turned the 72-year-old into a feminist icon.",
      "Dominique has also been found guilty of attempted aggravated rape of the wife of one of the co-accused, Jean-Pierre Marechal - who admitted drugging and raping his own wife, Cillia, and inviting Dominique to rape her too.",
      "Marechal was found guilty of attempted rape and aggravated rape.",
      "Dominique Pelicot was further convicted of taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline, and his daughters-in-law, Aurore and Celine.",
      "\"I am a rapist,\" he previously told the judges. \"I acknowledge all the facts [of the case] in their entirety.\" He had begged his ex-wife and three children for forgiveness, but his actions have torn the Pelicot family apart.",

      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot suffered memory loss and blackouts because of the drugs and she has spoken of 10 years of her life that have been lost.",
      "He was eventually caught because a security guard reported him to police for taking photographs under women's skirts in a supermarket.",

      "The other defendants come from all walks of life and most of them are from a 50km (30-mile) radius of the Pelicots' village of Mazan.

    "title": "Rare accounts of life for women inside notorious Iranian prison",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 02:25:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Interrogations, beatings, cramped quarters and the tight bonds women forge inside Tehran's Evin prison.",
    "story": [
      "Crouched alone on the floor, in a tiny, windowless cell, Nasim could hear what sounded like other prisoners being tortured. The guard would bang on the door and say: \"Can you hear that beating? Get ready, you're next.\"",
      "She was \"interrogated for 10 to 12 hours every day\" and repeatedly threatened with execution.",
      "The bare cell, no more than two metres across, had no bed or toilet. Four months in solitary confinement was the 36-year-old hairdresser's introduction to Iran's notorious Evin prison. The only people she saw were her interrogators. She thought that she would \"die and no-one would know\".",
      "We have pieced together accounts from multiple reliable sources to build a picture of everyday life for Nasim and other women, who are currently being held in Evin prison.",
      "Many were among the tens of thousands of people arrested in connection with the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" protests that followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Mahsa had been arrested for allegedly breaking Iranian laws that require women to wear the hijab and she died in police custody.",
      "While people have spoken about conditions in Evin after they have been released, it is rare to get details of inmates' lives while they are still inside.",
      "What we have heard reveals not only brutality, but a place of complex contrasts where the prisoners continue to campaign for women's rights and defiantly challenge restrictions imposed on them. There are surprising moments too - one inmate, occasionally allowed time alone with her husband, has even got pregnant.",
      "Nasim - who loves rap music and make-up - was taken into custody in April 2023 after joining protests with her friends, one of whom was killed in the government crackdown. She survived interrogations \"by thinking about those who died on the street\". People who saw Nasim when she came out of solitary confinement have described cuts and bruises on her body and how she was tortured to make false confessions.",
      "Rezvaneh was also arrested following the protests, along with her husband, in 2023. They both ended up in Evin, which has separate sections for men and women. Her interrogators said they would kill her husband and \"hit him so much that he would turn black like coal, and purple like an aubergine\".",
      "After solitary confinement, interrogations and humiliation, Nasim was moved to the women's wing, that houses about 70 people, including Rezvaneh, most of whom were arrested on political charges.",
      "It is where the British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcilffe, who was allowed to return to the UK in 2022, spent nearly four years of her sentence.",
      "Most of the women there have been sentenced because of their activism, for offences including spreading propaganda, drawing arms against the regime, and endangering national security.",
      "They live in four crowded cells with up to 20 people in each one and bunk beds stacked three-high.",
      "Living together in cramped quarters often causes friction, and sometimes fights - both physical and verbal - break out. But the women also forge tight bonds.",
      "In winter, \"everyone is freezing\" and the women \"walk around with hot water bottles\" to stay warm. In summer, they swelter in the heat.",
      "There is a small kitchen area with a couple of hobs where - if they have enough money to buy food from the prison shop - they can cook for themselves to supplement the basic prison meals that are brought to their cells.",
      "A dark, dirty area at the end of a corridor serves as a place to smoke. A small cemented yard with a little area for plants and a volleyball net provides a bit of outside space.",
      "They can wear their own clothes and are free to move around their living quarters which have two bathrooms. Every evening, they queue to use the toilet and brush their teeth.",
      "It was here, after she had been in prison for about four months, that Rezvaneh found out she was pregnant.",
      "She had struggled with infertility for years and had given up on ever having a baby. But according to Evin's rules, she and her husband - who is still a prisoner in the men's wing - were occasionally allowed to meet in private and, on one of these occasions, she conceived.",
      "When she realised she was pregnant she \"cried for several days\".",
      "She found \"the worst thing was the mental pressure and tensions inside the prison\". Finding a quiet place in the crowded cells, where people spend most of their days sitting on their beds, was a constant challenge.",
      "The prison food left her craving apple juice, bread, and meat, which were hard to get hold of. When she could get some meat from the prison shop it was at least twice the price of meat on the outside.",
      "The prison eventually allowed her to have an ultrasound scan at four months, and doctors told her she was having a girl.",
      "As she listened to \"each heartbeat the sense of hope became stronger\". But she was afraid that the conditions in prison would endanger the baby's health. Rezvaneh was not just concerned about her diet - she has epilepsy and needed to avoid stress. Prison doctors told her she had a high risk of miscarriage.",
      "Vida, a journalist, loves to paint. She uses bedsheets for canvases and paints portraits of the other women.",
      "One, which was smuggled out of Evin, is of Kurdish prisoner Pakhshan Azizi who travelled to Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria to help victims of the Islamic State group. Pakhshan has been sentenced to death, following charges of using arms to fight the Iranian regime, and there is great concern this sentence could be carried out soon.",
      "Vida has been warned not to draw anything with a hidden meaning. On one of the walls in the yard she painted crumbling bricks with a green forest behind them. The authorities sprayed over it.",
      "In a corridor she painted a picture of an Iranian cheetah running. Some of the women \"kept saying how much good energy they got from it\". But one night the authorities \"went and painted over it\" and restricted Vida's access to painting supplies.",
      "One of her murals has been left intact though - huge, blue ocean waves on the walls of the corridor where the women go to smoke.",
      "Getting medical care has been a constant battle for the women. One of the inmates, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, has life-threatening heart and lung conditions.",
      "But in prison she has had to fight long and hard for access to a doctor. Relatives said that officials repeatedly blocked treatment because she refused to wear a headscarf to a medical appointment. The authorities only relented after fellow prisoners went on hunger strike for two weeks. Narges was released for 21 days at the start of December on medical grounds.",
      "Behind bars, she and the others have carried out protests, pushing the boundaries and continuing to fight for their rights. Although the law requires them to wear headscarves, many refuse. And after a long fight with the authorities, the women were allowed curtains around the beds so they could have some privacy, out of view of CCTV cameras.",
      "One of the toughest things for the women is waiting to hear their sentences. Nasim's interrogators had threatened her with the death penalty and she had to wait nearly 500 days to find out her fate.",
      "She found solace in her fellow prisoners - who she has described as sisters who give her life and act as \"a balm on the wounds\" of her wings.",
      "Every morning, one of her friends pulls aside the bed curtain and makes her get up for breakfast.",
      "\"Each day we think of something to do, so by the end of the day we can tell ourselves, 'We lived today,'\" one of our sources explains.",
      "Others spend their time reading poetry, singing, playing homemade card games and watching TV - there are two televisions where they can watch Iranian channels showing drama, documentaries and football.",
      "It is these small things that kept Nasim going while she waited for her sentence, under the constant threat of execution. When the sentence finally came, she was given six years in prison, 74 lashes and 20 years in exile in a small town far from Tehran. She had been charged with distributing propaganda and drawing arms against the Islamic Republic.",
      "Despite the severity of the sentence, Nasim felt she could breathe again, and embrace the life she thought she had lost.",
      "Three other women in the wing have been sentenced to death for drawing arms against the regime or affiliation to armed groups. However one of them has had her sentence overturned.",
      "More than 800 people were executed in Iran last year - the highest number in eight years, according to Amnesty International. Most were for crimes involving violence and drugs. A handful were women.",
      "So every Tuesday, the women protest against executions, chanting in the prison yard, refusing to move all night and staging hunger strikes. The campaign has spread through jails across Iran, gaining international support. On the anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death the women in Evin burned headscarves.",
      "There have been repercussions - sometimes the guards raid their cells and women have been beaten and injured. They can also be taken for further interrogations, put back in solitary confinement or have phone calls and visits blocked. Most of the guards are women and \"sometimes they are kind, sometimes they are cruel and hard-hearted, depending on what orders they receive from a higher authority\", says one of our sources.",
      "The Iranian government routinely denies allegations of human rights violations, saying conditions inside Evin prison meet all necessary standards and prisoners are not mistreated.",
      "As Rezvaneh's due date approached, the prison authorities allowed her to temporarily leave prison for the birth. In October, she had a baby girl.",
      "But her joy and relief at the safe arrival of her daughter is mingled with fear, sadness and anger. Her husband was not allowed out of prison with her, although she has been able to take their daughter to visit him in Evin.",
      "And because of the stress, Rezvaneh has struggled to produce breastmilk. She is expecting to be recalled to Evin prison soon with her baby daughter to serve the rest of her five-year sentence - if she's not granted an early release, that could be nearly four years.",
      "Babies are usually allowed to stay with their mothers in jail until the age of two. After that they are often sent to a close relative, or if that is not possible, they might be placed in a children's home.",
      "But rather than stop the inmates, one prisoner has said the challenges they face have made her  \"braver and stronger,\" supporting their belief that \"the future is clear: to fight, even in prison\".",

    "title": "United Front: China's 'magic weapon' caught in a spy controversy",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 22:15:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The UFWD is a decades-old - and increasingly controversial - arm of China's Communist Party. What does it do?",
    "story": [
      "The People's Republic of China has a \"magic weapon\", according to its founding leader Mao Zedong and its current president Xi Jinping.",
      "It is called the United Front Work Department - and it is raising as much alarm in the West as Beijing's growing military arsenal.",
      "Yang Tengbo, a prominent businessman who has been linked to Prince Andrew, is the latest overseas Chinese citizen to be scrutinised - and sanctioned - for his links to the UFWD.",
      "The existence of the department is far from a secret. A decades-old and well-documented arm of the Chinese Communist Party, it has been mired in controversy before. Investigators from the US to Australia have cited the UFWD in multiple espionage cases, often accusing Beijing of using it for foreign interference.",
      "Beijing has denied all espionage allegations, calling them ludicrous.",
      "So what is the UFWD and what does it do?",
      "'Controlling China's message'",
      "The United Front - originally referring to a broad communist alliance - was once hailed by Mao as the key to the Communist Party's triumph in the decades-long Chinese Civil War.",
      "After the war ended in 1949 and the party began ruling China, United Front activities took a backseat to other priorities. But in the last decade under Xi, the United Front has seen a renaissance of sorts.",
      "Xi's version of the United Front is broadly consistent with earlier incarnations: to \"build the broadest possible coalition with all social forces that are relevant\", according to Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.",
      "On the face of it, the UFWD is not shadowy - it even has a website and reports many of its activities on it. But the extent of its work - and its reach - is less clear.",
      "While a large part of that work is domestic, Dr Ohlberg said, \"a key target that has been defined for United Front work is overseas Chinese\".",
      "Today, the UFWD seeks to influence public discussions about sensitive issues ranging from Taiwan - which China claims as its territory - to  the suppression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang.",
      "It also tries to shape narratives about China in foreign media, target Chinese government critics abroad and co-opt influential overseas Chinese figures.",
      "\"United Front work can include espionage but [it] is broader than espionage,\" Audrye Wong, assistant professor of politics at the University of Southern California, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Beyond the act of acquiring covert information from a foreign government, United Front activities centre on the broader mobilisation of overseas Chinese,\" she said, adding that China is \"unique in the scale and scope\" of such influence activities.",
      "China has always had the ambition for such influence, but its rise in recent decades has given Beijing the ability to exercise it.",
      "Since Xi became president in 2012, he has been especially proactive in crafting China's message to the world, enouraging a confrontational \"wolf warrior\" approach to diplomacy and urging his country's diaspora to \"tell China's story well\".",
      "The UFWD operates through various overseas Chinese community organisations, which have vigorously defended the Communist Party beyond its shores. They have censored anti-CCP artwork and protested at the activities of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. The UFWD has also been linked to threats against members of persecuted minorities abroad, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs.",
      "But much of the UFWD's work overlaps with other party agencies, operating under what observers have described as \"plausible deniability\".",
      "It is this murkiness that is causing so much suspicion and apprehension about the UFWD.",
      "When Yang appealed against his ban, judges agreed with the then secretary of state's report that Yang \"represented a risk to national security\" - citing the fact that he downplayed his ties with the UFWD as one of the reasons that led them to that conclusion.",
      "Yang, however, maintains that he has not done anything unlawful and that the spy allegations are \"entirely untrue\".",
      "Cases like Yang's are becoming increasingly common. In 2022, British Chinese lawyer Christine Lee was accused by the MI5 of acting through the UFWD to cultivate relationships with influential people in the UK. The following year, Liang Litang, a US citizen who ran a Chinese restaurant in Boston, was indicted for providing information about Chinese dissidents in the area to his contacts in the UFWD.",
      "And in September, Linda Sun, a former aide in the New York governor's office, was charged with using her position to serve Chinese government interests - receiving benefits, including travel, in return. According to Chinese state media reports, she had met a top UFWD official in 2017, who told her to \"be an ambassador of Sino-American friendship\".",
      "It is not uncommon for prominent and successful Chinese people to be associated with the party, whose approval they often need, especially in the business world.",
      "But where is the line between peddling influence and espionage?",
      "\"The boundary between influence and espionage is blurry\" when it comes to Beijing's operations, said Ho-fung Hung, a politics professor at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Yang Tengbo: Who is alleged Chinese spy linked to Prince Andrew?",
      "Spy allegations pose dilemma for UK's China policy",
      "This ambiguity has intensified after China passed a law in 2017 mandating Chinese nationals and companies to co-operate with intelligence probes, including sharing information with the Chinese government - a move that Dr Hung said \"effectively turns everyone into potential spies\".",
      "The Ministry of State Security has released dramatic propaganda videos warning the public that foreign spies are everywhere and \"they are cunning and sneaky \".",
      "Some students who were sent on special trips abroad were told by their universities to limit contact with foreigners and were asked for a report of their activities on their return.",
      "And yet Xi is keen to promote China to the world. So he has tasked a trusted arm of the party to project strength abroad.",
      "And that is becoming a challenge for Western powers - how do they balance doing business with the world's second-largest economy alongside serious security concerns?",
      "Wrestling with the long arm of Beijing",
      "Genuine fears over China's overseas influence are playing into more hawkish sentiments in the West, often leaving governments in a dilemma.",
      "Some, like Australia, have tried to protect themselves with fresh foreign interference laws that criminalise individuals deemed to be meddling in domestic affairs. In 2020, the US imposed visa restrictions on people seen as active in UFWD activities.",
      "An irked Beijing has warned that such laws - and the prosecutions they have spurred - hinder bilateral relations.",
      "\"The so-called allegations of Chinese espionage are utterly absurd,\" a foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question about Yang. \"The development of China-UK relations serves the common interests of both countries.\"",
      "Some experts say that the long arm of China's United Front is indeed concerning.",
      "\"Western governments now need to be less naive about China's United Front work and take it as a serious threat not only to national security but also to the safety and freedom of many ethnic Chinese citizens,\" Dr Hung says.",
      "But, he adds, \"governments also need to be vigilant against anti-Chinese racism and work hard to build trust and co-operation with ethnic Chinese communities in countering the threat together.\"",
      "Last December, Di Sanh Duong, a Vietnam-born ethnic Chinese community leader in Australia, was convicted of planning foreign interference for trying to cosy up to an Australian minister. Prosecutors argued that he was an \"ideal target\" for the UFWD because he had run for office in the 1990s and boasted ties with Chinese officials.",
      "Duong's trial had centred around what he meant when he said the inclusion of the minister at a charity event would be beneficial to \"us Chinese\" - did he mean the Chinese community in Australia, or mainland China?",
      "In the end, Duong's conviction - and a prison sentence - raised serious concerns that such broad anti-espionage laws and prosecutions can easily become weapons for targeting ethnic Chinese people.",
      "\"It's important to remember that not everyone who is ethnically Chinese is a supporter of the Chinese Communist Party. And not everyone who is involved in these diaspora organisations is driven by fervent loyalty to China,\" Dr Wong says.",
      "\"Overly aggressive policies based on racial profiling will only legitimise the Chinese government's propaganda that ethnic Chinese are not welcome and end up pushing diaspora communities further into Beijing's arms.\"",
      "What is behind Starmer's meeting with China's president?",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "A cartoon cat has been vexing China\u2019s censors \u2013 now he says they are on his tail"

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 00:27:30 GMT",
    "summary": "The Hollywood star plays famous opera singer Maria Callas in a new biopic.",
    "story": [
      "Angelina Jolie is notoriously private.",
      "But in a new interview with BBC News, the Hollywood star spoke candidly about her experience of working on set with her eldest sons, saying they saw \"the pain\" she usually hides from them.",
      "The actress is starring in a new biopic, titled Maria, about opera singer Maria Callas.",
      "Two of Jolie's six children with ex-husband Brad Pitt, Maddox and Pax, took on roles as production assistants on the film.",
      "\"The character [Callas] has a lot of pain and they've of course seen me go through a lot of things, but they hadn't experienced me expressing a lot of the pain that usually a parent hides from a child,\" she said.",
      "\"So they were there to witness some of that, but then we would hug or they would bring me cups of tea.\"",
      "Jolie added that it was \"a new way\" of finding out how to be honest with her children about her feelings, \"in an even greater way\".",
      "Written by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, the film focuses on Callas's final years, in the 1970s, when she was living in Paris.",
      "With Jolie taking on acting roles relatively infrequently in recent years, the film has provided something of a comeback narrative for her and could lead to an Oscar nomination for best actress.",
      "Callas was a US-born Greek soprano, and one of opera's best-known singers.",
      "In Maria, a blend of Jolie's own voice and original recordings by Callas are used in the singing scenes.",
      "The actress learnt to sing opera for the role, something she describes as \"very physically demanding\".",
      "Training took around seven months, she said.",
      "\"We started with regular singing classes and it was challenging in many ways, but when the opera classes began, what it requires with your breathwork and your body and just the force of what you push through yourself, it's just a very different physicality.\"",
      "Jolie, whose previous film credits include Changeling, Maleficent, Salt, and Mr & Mrs Smith, said she hasn't sung before, and was \"actually quite shy about singing\".",
      "\"It was probably one of the areas in my life that I was hesitant,\" she said.",
      "But she indicated that it was also something she enjoyed.",
      "\"One of the greatest privileges of being an actor is you often are supported by a crew to try something and explore something you've never done and this certainly was most challenging,\" she said.",
      "Jolie's sons Maddox, 23, and Pax, 21, have worked on a number of productions with her before, including her film Without Blood.",
      "Both of them accompanied her at the New York City premiere of Maria in September, alongside their younger sister Zahara.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016. The pair were engaged in a custody battle that resulted in Pitt being awarded joint custody in 2021.",
      "The Hollywood stars also share daughters Shiloh and Vivienne, and another son Knox.",
      "On the set of the film, both Maddox and Pax were \"very busy\", director Pablo Larra\u00edn said. \"They were good professionals,\" he added.",
      "Jolie said that during filming, Pax recorded a lot of her singing practice \"so he was with me in my early horrible days,\" she laughed.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 00:07:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The EU wants a trade deal with four South American nations, but France is strongly opposed.",
    "story": [
      "As the ink was drying on one of the world's biggest trade deals, signed in Uruguay this month, and hailed as a milestone for the global economy, anger was brewing thousands of miles away in France.",
      "Under the agreement between the EU on one hand, and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on the other, tariffs will be greatly reduced and the amounts of imports and exports allowed will be increased.",
      "The deal would affect almost 800 million people.",
      "It comes as a marked contrast to Donald Trump's plans to greatly increase protectionism when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "The deal still needs to be approved by the 27 EU member states, and France is planning to block it, due to fears that it will harm its farming sector.",
      "Alix Heurtault, a 34-year-old French farmer, says she is worried about her future if the planned agreement goes ahead.",
      "\"I fear that the deal will mean making ends meet becoming even more difficult for farmers like me,\" she says.",
      "As a result, she is crossing her fingers that the French government will be able to stop it.",
      "The planned trade agreement will mean more South American beef, chicken and sugar coming to the EU, and at lower prices. While in the opposite direction, the likes of European cars, clothing and wine would have more access to the Mercosur zone.",
      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",
      "And with the media giving very conflicting reports about Italy's position, we'll have to wait and see which way the Italians go when the vote is held some time in 2025.",
      "In the meantime, French farmers are continuing to put pressure on Paris to not back down. French President Emmanuel Macron is listening, and has described the trade deal as \"unacceptable in its current form\".",
      "Ms Heurtault grows sugar beet, wheat and barley on a 150-hectare farm in the small village of Villeneuve-sur-Auvers located 60km (37 miles) south of Paris.",
      "She says that the deal would see French farmers badly hit in order to help EU manufacturers. \"It feels like we're a bargaining chip. Farmers in the Mercosur countries [the name of the Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay block] have less restrictions regarding pesticides and lower labour costs.\"",
      "Ms Heurtault's view is widely held across the French farming sector, which has been holding regular protests in recent months.",
      "A few weeks ago some 200 farmers dumped bales of straw in front of the Grand Palais museum and exhibition centre in Paris.",
      "They lit up red flares, and chanted slogans like \"We are feeding you, show us some respect\".",
      "The protest was held to coincide with an annual meeting of commodities importers and exporters taking place at the venue.",
      "St\u00e9phane Gallais, a cattle farmer and the national secretary of farmers' union Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, which had organised the event, explained why it was being held.",
      "\"Today's demonstration is a stance against free trade, especially the EU-Mercosur agreement that we've been opposing since it was first discussed in the late 1990s,\" he said.",
      "While France is opposed to the trade deal, other EU nations, such as Germany, Spain and Portugal are strongly in favour of it.",
      "Proponents welcome the fact it would be a marked contrast to Trump's threats of increased protectionism.",
      "\"It would be a good signal at a time when we have movement in the opposite direction towards economic fragmentation and protectionism, especially with free-trade sceptic US President Donald Trump re-elected,\" says Uri Dadush, a research professor for trade policy at the University of Maryland in the US.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that while European farmers will be negatively impacted, he says this will be very limited.",
      "\"The deal is a threat for European farmers, as the world's most competitive agricultural sector gets access to their market, but we're talking about a tiny amount of liberalisation spread out over a long period of time,\" he says.",
      "He points out that under the agreement the Mercosur nations would still have limits on what they can export to the EU. Such as their proposed initial increased annual quota of beef exports still only accounting for less than 1% of EU consumption of the meat.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that \"the deal is an opportunity to push for much needed market-orientated reform in the heavily-subsidised EU agricultural sector, and Mercosur's highly-protected factory sector\".",
      "Chris Hegadorn, adjunct professor for global food policies at Paris-based university Sciences Po, and former secretary of the UN's Committee on World Food Security, says the agreement would overall be beneficial to Europe \u2013 including its farmers.",
      "\"It obviously depends on the subcategory you're looking at, but French cheese and wine producers will benefit,\" he says.",
      "He adds that it will also improve health and environmental standards in the Mercosur countries, and increase ties with the EU at a time when \"China is also trying to get a foothold in Latin America\".",
      "But David Cayla, lecturer for economics at Angers University in western France and member of the left-wing collective \"The Dismayed Economists\", doubts the EU will be able to enforce higher standards in Latin American countries.",
      "\"It's impossible to control their implementation,\" he says. \"Our farmers will only face increased competition from countries with a better climate and more fertile soils.",
      "\"But we need to protect European agriculture \u2013 that's also a question of food sovereignty,\" he emphasizes, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic showed how quickly worldwide supply chains could collapse in times of crisis.",
      "Antoine Gomel, who in 2017 took over his family's 24-hectare chicken and beef farm in a small village near Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France, says that opposing the trade deal is about saving the French countryside.",
      "\"Farms keep disappearing leaving our villages deserted \u2013 the deal will only accelerate that,\" says the 42-year-old.",
      "\"But farms are crucial to cohesion in the countryside, not least as they create jobs. People in France and abroad increasingly vote for the far right because they feel disorientated and alone.",
      "\"Farms can contribute to bringing them back together, by literally anchoring them.\"",
      "Back in front of the Grand Palais in Paris, cleaners were sweeping away the remaining straw from the protesters.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:36:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

      "\"Angels With Dirty Faces\" (1938)",
      "Once the Hays Office decided in the early 1930s that movies had become too violent and licentious, bad guys either had to make good for their crimes, or pay the ultimate price. No longer could James Cagney break the law and get away with it! Director Michael Curtiz's film about childhood friends who follow different paths \u2014 Cagney, as gangster Rocky Sullivan, and Pat O'Brien, as Father Connolly \u2014 offers a redemptive tale in which young hoodlums idolize Rocky. But when the condemned criminal is being led to the execution chamber, his change of heart \u2014 pretending to die a coward's death \u2014 offers a way out for the impressionable youth. One of Cagney's best performances, the film also features Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer, Ann Sheridan, and the Dead End Kids (whose Hollywood careers would turn from kitchen sink drama to slapstick comedy).",

      "Eddie Murphy had already appeared in two hit films \u2014 \"48 HRS.,\" opposite Nick Nolte, and \"Trading Places,\" pairing off against Dan Aykroyd \u2014 but in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" Murphy carried the film on his own as Detroit detective Axel Foley, a fish-out-of-water who has gone to Los Angeles on the trail of a killer. Buoyed by Murphy's screen charisma and Harold Faltermeyer's electronic score, the mix of action and comedy was a blockbuster, a formula carried forth in three sequels starring Murphy.",
      "\"The Chelsea Girls\" (1966)",
      "Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey's 16mm feature was a proto-typical underground movie \u2014 heavily improvised, with rough edits (or no edits), multiple and split screens, and a leisurely 3.5-hour length. Being banned in Boston at least added to its allure. Today, the film, set in the landmark Chelsea Hotel in New York City, and featuring Nico, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, International Velvet, Mario Montez, Mary Woronov, Dorothy Dean and other Warhol \"Superstars,\" offers a unique time capsule of the bohemian 1960s.",

      "\"Dirty Dancing\" (1987)",
      "At a 1960s Catskills resort, a teenage girl vacationing with family hits the dance floor with a hot instructor, and summers would never be the same.

But when dad returns from investigating the landing site, there's something not quite right about him. And then, a similar change comes over his mother. What are those strange marks on the back of their necks? What's poor little David to do? Fifties paranoia blends with stylish photography, cool-looking sets, and ridiculous Martian costumes in this nostalgic sci-fi tale directed by William Cameron Menzies.",

Alas, there is a lever that warns, if pulled, it will mean the end of the Earth! Restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive primarily from the original nitrate negative, this is a hilarious take on the End Times \u2014 and the problem of pets that refuse to obey. Bad, BAD dog! [You can watch the restored film here.]",

      "\"The Miracle Worker\" (1962)",
      "Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke each won Academy Awards for their performances in the true story of Anne Sullivan and her attempts to teach Helen Keller, a child deaf and blind since she was a toddler. Keller's autobiography was originally adapted for television and later Broadway (Bancroft and Duke both starred in the stage version). Director Arthur Penn's black-and-white film version preserved the actresses' performances in a cooly unsentimental story of determination and human connection.",
      "\"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991)",
      "Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy\") wrote and directed this haunting tale of friendship, loosely based on plays of Shakespeare, starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as street hustlers searching for family and connection.",
      "\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)",
      "The Coen Brothers' sharp precision and keen eye for irony is beautifully on display in this enthralling modern-day Western, in which Josh Brolin's hunter comes across the scene of a drug deal gone very bad. Alas, that satchel containing mounds of currency with no living owner is just a little too tempting to pass by. Enter Javier Bardem's sinister hit man, hot on Brolin's trail, who will let nothing deter him from his prey. Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, best direction, and best supporting actor for Bardem, weird haircut and all.",
      "\"Powwow Highway\" (1989)",
      "A prize-winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Jonathan Wacks' comic-drama was remarkable in its time for telling a humanistic story of Native Americans without resorting to stereotypes. Gary Farmer and A. Martinez star as former childhood friends who reconnect for a road trip in a dilapidated car, a journey that is by turns spiritual and criminal.",
      "\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)",
      "An inspirational biopic of one of sports' true legends, this story of New York Yankee Lou Gehrig, whose life came undone with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (what came to become known as Lou Gehrig's disease), stars Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, and features several of Gehrig's teammates (including Babe Ruth) as themselves. Cooper's reenactment of Gehrig's farewell speech at Yankee Stadium (in which he states, \"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\") became one of the actor's most memorable moments.",
      "\"The Social Network\" (2010)",
      "Like the Akira Kurosawa classic \"Rashomon,\" \"The Social Network\" uses competing points of view to decipher the origins of Facebook, as told through legal depositions being filed years after the revolutionary website was born, by former friends now suing each other. Based on Ben Mezrich's \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" David Fincher's classic is a tale of genius, hubris and ethics, involving a paradox: A site founded on the notion of exclusivity which grew to host hundreds of millions of members. Starring Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield, Max Minghella, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake, and an Oscar-winning script by Aaron Sorkin. Oscars also went to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for their haunting score, and to editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.",
      "\"Spy Kids\" (2001)",
      "Writer-director Robert Rodriguez made a splash with his debut feature, \"El Mariachi,\" and followed with \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk till Dawn.\" But for the fantasy \"Spy Kids,\" he connected with his inner kid, in a story about two children of secret agents who go out on a mission to rescue their captured parents.

      "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982)",
      "The first film of the \"Star Trek\" franchise to be inducted in the National Film Registry, it's considered by most to be the best movie, in capturing both the zing of the original TV series and the camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it's a sequel of sorts to the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" in which a 20th century villain in hibernation is thawed out, stirring much interplanetary trouble. In \"Wrath of Khan,\" Ricardo Montalban returns in the role of Khan, who sets his sights not just on destroying worlds, but also in taking revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). There is action galore, but it's Kirk's friendship with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that gives this film its emotional heft.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974)",
      "Among exploitation movies, horror is a genre that has enticed many aspiring filmmakers with little money but lots of fake blood at hand. But Tobe Hooper's grand guignol tale of a group of young people who find themselves at the wrong isolated farmhouse went far beyond typical drive-in fare. It would give rise to countless slasher films (from \"Halloween\" to \"Friday the 13th\") in which a weapon-wielding bad guy (in this case Leatherface) ticks off cast members one by one. Nasty, bloody and weirdly funny, the film even found itself projected onto the screen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 a fact it heralded in newspaper ads, as if that would give a low-budget horror film more street cred.",
      "\"Up in Smoke\" (1978)",
      "The counter-culture duo Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong had already released five successful comedy albums (including \"Big Bambu\" and \"Los Cochinos\") when they dipped their toes into movies with this stoner comedy. Dipped their toes isn't exactly accurate, though; they plunged head-first into a wild m\u00e9lange of bits involving marijuana, LSD, hash, cocaine (or Ajax cleanser mistaken for cocaine), alcohol, and pills that are anybody's guess what they are. \"Up in Smoke\" took in more than $100 million at the box office, leading to a string of Cheech & Chong films.",
      "\"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974)",
      "Bill Cosby, Harry Belafonte, and director Sidney Poitier star in this action comedy in which victims of a robbery go in search of a stolen wallet containing a winning lottery ticket. With Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, Roscoe Lee Browne and Rosalind Cash. Poitier directed two follow-up films starring himself and Cosby, \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action.\"",
      "\"Will\" (1981)",

    "story": [
      "Francis Ford Coppola, the visionary director behind \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" was named a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating his lifetime of artistic achievements. Over a career spanning more than half a century, the 85-year-old filmmaker has earned five Oscars, six Golden Globes, two Palme d'Or awards and a BAFTA.",
      "When asked if there is a signature \"Coppola style,\" the director said, \"I think I was always someone even as a 17-year-old, 18-year-old film director who wanted to poeticize the work I did, but then take it to the very brink where if I took it any further, it would fall off the cliff.\"",
      "The daring creative philosophy has shaped some of the most influential films in history, including \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather\" trilogy.",
      "Coppola's journey began in Detroit, where he was born into an Italian-American family. Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",
      "Coppola went on to adapt S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish,\" which featured his nephew, Nicolas Cage.",
      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts. Reflecting on his priorities, Coppola said, \"I want my children to be healthy, and I want them to be happy in their work, which they seem to be. I'm now more concerned that there's going to be an Earth here that's going to sustain itself.\"",
      "Now, as a Kennedy Center honoree, Coppola reflected on how he views himself, saying, \"I think of someone who loved his human family \u2014 not just my immediate family, but the entire human family. That's who I am. I am the one who loves everybody.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors\u00a0ceremony, which took place on Dec. 8, 2024, will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 22.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "More from the series",
      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",
      "It all should be easier for patients, Xiao said: \"You shouldn't have to be a medical billing expert to know what you're going to pay.\"",

      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",

      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",

Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 For weeks it was dubbed simply \"Disease X.\" But the mysterious flu-like disease that has killed more than 143 people \u2014 mainly women and young children \u2014 in the Democratic Republic of Congo has finally been identified.",
      "\"The mystery has finally been solved,\" Congo's health ministry declared in a statement on Tuesday. \"It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness.\"",
      "The health agency said malnutrition in the hardest-hit region had weakened the local population's immunity, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease. People who contracted the malaria infection have exhibited symptoms including headache, fever, cough and body ache.",
      "The Congo's health minister had told journalists the country was on \"maximum alert\" over the spread of the previously unidentified disease, and health officials told CBS News in early December that the remoteness of the epicenter of the outbreak and lack of a diagnosis made it difficult to launch a concerted response.",
      "At least 592 cases were reported after the alert was first raised by Congo's health ministry on Oct. 29. The ministry said the disease had a fatality rate of 6.25%. More than half of the deaths recorded were children younger than five who were severely malnourished when they contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "At a press briefing on Dec. 10, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 samples from patients suffering from the mysterious disease had tested positive for malaria, but he said they were still testing at the time for other diseases.",
      "The Congolese government had sent a rapid intervention team to the Kwango province, 435 miles southeast of capital city Kinshasa, consisting of epidemiologists and other medical experts. Their objective was to identify the disease and mount a suitable response. Government officials had earlier warned locals to avoid touching people infected with the illness or the bodies of those who had died.",
      "Congo has suffered from many disease outbreaks in recent years, including typhoid, malaria and anemia. The country has also grappled with an\u00a0mpox outbreak, with more than 47,000 suspected cases and over 1,000 suspected deaths from the disease, according to the WHO.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What is red dye 3?",
      "The dye called Red No. 3, also made of petroleum, is what gives a bright cherry-red color to a lot of foods and candies.",
      "\"There seems to be an increased risk, at least in rats, of thyroid cancer. We also see an association with hyperactivity in kids,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday.",
      "Scientists, consumer protection groups and food safety groups have petitioned the FDA to withdraw their approval for Red No. 3, and the FDA is expected to act sometime in the next few weeks, Gounder said.",
      "This dye has already been banned in cosmetics and topical medications since 1990.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Gounder said it's important to look at labels since it's the only way to know if there are synthetic dyes in a product.",
      "\"You can't look at the color. Even white foods may have synthetic dyes to make it brighter,\" she said.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",

      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",

      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",
      "Most TSA workers, about 95%, are considered essential, and would therefore remain on the job in the event of a shutdown \u2014 but without pay \u2014 TSA administrator David Pekoske said in a post on X.",

      "Here is how a government shutdown will affect air travel for consumers.",
      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",
      "Not for now. Passengers will still be able to travel on flights they have booked, with operations expected to continue as normal at least in the early days of a shutdown. That's because TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential airport staff will remain on the job.",
      "Will TSA screening lines be longer?",
      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another.

      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:23:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. government could face a shutdown at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21, 2024. Here's what could be impacted.",
    "story": [
      "With one federal spending bill\u00a0now scrapped\u00a0and a revised version voted down on Thursday night, the U.S. faces a possible government shutdown that could begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21, when current funding is set to lapse. That raises questions about what types of services and payments could be impacted just days before the holidays.",
      "A looming shutdown stems from controversy over a spending bill that would have extended funding through March 14, but which was nixed by House Speaker Mike Johnson after some Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending that had been added to the bill.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a billionaire who spent almost $300 million to back Trump and other Republican candidates in the November election, had also voiced opposition to the spending bill, which he called \"terrible.\" When the measure was scrapped, Musk proclaimed on X, \"The voice of the people has triumphed!\"",
      "House Republicans on Friday regrouped after the failed vote on Thursday evening, with Johnson telling reporters at the Capitol he's \"expecting votes this morning, so stay tuned \u2014 we've got a plan.\" House Republicans are set to gather on Capitol Hill at 12:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically barred from doling out money, although there are some exceptions, such as activities to protect life and property. At the same time, agencies must make decisions about which workers will stay on the job, which can lead to varying impacts on government operations.",
      "\"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans or government benefits,\" David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this year in a blog post.",
      "Here's what could be impacted if the U.S. government shuts down on Dec. 21.",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "If the federal government shuts down, each federal agency will determine its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, although government operations deemed nonessential will stop happening.",
      "Many government workers will be furloughed, although those providing essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control will continue to report to their jobs. For instance, essential government agencies like the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard would remain open.",
      "However, none of those federal workers would get paid until Congress approves a new spending bill. After the shutdown ends, workers will receive retroactive paychecks covering the days they were furloughed or had to work without pay, according to the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "That could create hardships for some government workers, as occurred during a shutdown that stretched for more than 30 days, starting on Dec. 22, 2018. During that stoppage, many federal workers turned to food pantries and other forms of aid to get through the several weeks when they didn't receive paychecks.",
      "Is Social Security affected by a government shutdown?",
      "The nation's 67 million Social Security recipients would continue to receive their checks even if the government closes for business. Medicare will also continue to operate, which means seniors covered by the health care plan won't have their medications or treatments impacted.",
      "That's because both Social Security and Medicare benefits are authorized by laws that don't require annual approval.",
      "Even so, Social Security's administrative budget is discretionary, which means it needs approval from Congress, according to the AARP. As a result, some services offered by the Social Security Administration could be impacted in a shutdown, such as benefit verification and new applications for benefits, the group says.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect the TSA or air travel?",
      "With millions of Americans expected to travel over the holidays, there are plenty of questions about how a shutdown could impact air travel. Because they provide essential services, air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"We expect to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2,\" a TSA spokesperson said. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.\"",
      "Does the USPS deliver mail in a government shutdown?",
      "Yes, because the U.S. Postal Service is an independent agency. In previous shutdowns, operations have continued. That means mail would still be delivered, and post offices will remain open.",
      "Does the military get paid in a government shutdown?",
      "Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement would continue to work, but would not be paid until Congress signs off on new spending. But most civilian personnel working for the U.S. Department of Defense would be furloughed.",
      "Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department are expected to start alerting workers about shutdown protocols on Thursday, according to the Military Times. The impact would likely be felt in the first week of January when the first military paychecks of 2025 will be deposited, which are scheduled to include a 4.5% pay increase for all troops, the publication noted.",
      "What closes in a government shutdown?",
      "Many services would be put on hold or delayed if there is a shutdown, including environmental and food inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy group that focuses on federal spending.",
      "The national parks would likely close, while the National Institutes of Health could also be impacted, the group noted.",
      "While taxes are still due, such as quarterly estimated payments due on Jan. 15, the IRS could also be impacted by furloughs, although tax filing season typically doesn't kick off until late January. Still, a shutdown plan published earlier this year notes that many IRS functions would cease, including tax audits and services such as answering calls from taxpayers.",
      "How long could a government shutdown last?",
      "The odds of a government shutdown have increased with the latest developments, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Dec. 18 research note. But, they added, \"a protracted shutdown looks unlikely in our view.\"",
      "A spending measure also could be passed before the Dec. 21 deadline if Republicans can revise it to appease Trump, who objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending added to the bill, Goldman's analysts added.",
      "\"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components \u2014 he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid \u2014 so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline, they wrote.",

      "Big Lots is preparing to close all of its stores, the bankrupt discount retailer said Thursday.",
      "The company had previously planned to sell its assets to private equity firm Nexus Capital Management, but that deal is no longer expected to proceed, according to Big Lots. Although the company continues to negotiate with Nexus as well as explore other strategic alternatives, it now plans to shutter all of its locations and is planning to host \"going out of business\" sales at all stores.",
      "Big Lots, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, and operates more than 900 locations across the U.S., sells furniture, lawn and garden, apparel, health and beauty, and other consumer goods. Big Lots appeals to deal seekers, billing itself as a place that delivers \"bargains to brag about on everything for the home, including furniture, d\u00e9cor, pantry and more.\"",

      "On its website, Big Lots announced deals of up to 50% off the entire web store, while confirming that all physical Big Lots stores are closing.",
      "Big Lots filed for\u00a0bankruptcy protection\u00a0in September, saying it intended to sell its business to Nexus. In August, Big Lots announced its intention close\u00a0up to 315\u00a0stores, and in October disclosed plans to shut down another 56 locations in 27 states.",

      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it because it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S. as the government shutdown looms.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel\u00a0at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The\u00a0Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\"Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\" AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",

      "Planning ahead for 2025",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\"Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\" Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \"If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\""

      "NAR expects mortgage rates to stabilize, if not fall as sharply as some house-hunters were hoping, next year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its third straight cut in its benchmark rate, lowering the federal funds rate by another quarter of a percentage point. Although mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate moves, they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rising or falling along with the return on government debt.",

The Fed is now hinting at only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection in September of four. Experts expect mortgage rates may come down slightly with the Fed's the latest reduction possibly contributing to a modest decline.",
      "The real estate group also expects home prices to rise further in the coming year, though more slowly than in 2024. The number of homes on the market is \u00a0and will continue to increase in 2025.",
      "\"Homebuyers will have more success next year,\" Yun said in the report. \"The worst of the affordability challenges are over as more inventory, stable mortgage rates and continued job and income growth pave the way for more Americans to achieve homeownership.\"",
      "Here, in alphabetical order, are NAR's 10 top housing hot spots for 2025.",
      "Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire",
      "Buying a home in Boston-Cambridge-Newton area isn't exactly cheap, with home prices averaging $694,494, according to Zillow. That's more than $200,000 north of the national average home price of\u00a0$430,584.",
      "Still, the metro area has a number of strengths. For one, NAR expects the local housing market, which includes portions of southern New Hampshire, next year to benefit from stabilizing mortgage rates, which would likely mean fewer locked-in homeowners. Mortgage rates in Boston typically skew lower than the national average, according to the real estate group, which noted that Boston also has a good number starter-homes. Typically priced at 85% of the median-priced home, starter homes are critical for first-time buyers.",
      "Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, North Carolina-South Carolina",
      "In addition to 10% job growth over the last five years, Charlotte has a significant share of affordable housing, with 43% of homes priced below $324,000 \u2014 a huge draw for first-time buyers and young families. The average interest rate in the area is 6.85%, slightly below the national average of 6.89% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.",
      "Grand Rapids-Kentwood, Michigan",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers an ample stock of affordable homes, with the average home price at $271,960, while mortgage rates hover around 6.9%, slightly above the national average. But because Grand Rapids has a small proportion of mortgage originations with rates below 6%, NAR predicts fewer lock-ins and more listings in 2025.",
      "Greenville-Anderson, South Carolina",
      "With home prices averaging $307,315 and a large influx of new residents, houses in Greenville don't stay listed for long \u2014 typically about 17 days. Mortgage rates run just above the national average, at 6.9%, most likely because of recent foreclosures happening in the state, according to MorgageRates.com.",
      "NAR points to the 42% of homes categorized as starter homes in Greenville as another reason why it predicts the local housing market will be a standout for families and young professionals in 2025.",
      "Hartford-East-Hartford-Middletown, Connecticut",
      "When it comes to affordability, Hartford's average home price of $178,696 is hard to beat. In 2023, The city's average mortgage rate of 6.5% was one of the lowest among the top markets. Connecticut's capital city also has the highest proportion of homeowners surpassing the area's average tenure of 17 years, an indication of a potential increase in local inventory, according to NAR.",
      "Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Indiana",
      "Indianapolis made NAR's list because of strong job growth and housing affordability. Nearly 42% of the housing stock is priced below $236,000, with the average home value at $223,261. \"With fewer 'locked-in' homeowners than the national level, this area is likely to see more available inventory as mortgage rates stabilize around 6% next year,\" according to NAR.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas",
      "Kansas City's generally lower average mortgage rate and smaller share of locked-in homeowners makes it a favorable market for financing and inventory. The average house is priced at $233,826, making homeownership in the area affordable for one in three millennials. Affordability plus competitive financing will make the Kansas City housing market a top performer in 2025, according to NAR.",
      "Knoxville, Tennessee",
      "One of the hottest housing markets in Tennessee, Knoxville is a place where newcomers go to settle down \u2014 roughly 50% of movers to the area decide to buy a home, NAR says. The average value of a home in Knoxville is $350,614, making this city located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains affordable compared with other major cities.",
      "Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Arizona",
      "The average home value in Phoenix is $414,977. The relatively affordable housing stock, plus a comparatively lower cost of living and strong job growth, have made Arizona's capital city a key destination for Californians looking to relocate. \"Demographic shifts and economic expansion has established Phoenix as a prosperous and dynamic market,\" according to NAR.",
      "San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas",
      "The average home in San Antonio is priced at\u00a0$250,834, which makes it one of the few markets to see a decrease in residential real estate costs over the past year. The city, home of The Alamo, also has had one of the strongest records of job growth in the U.S. in recent years, according to the NAR report, and it continues to attract a steady influx of new residents.",

      "The union noted that Starbucks' new Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job. But the company recently proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said.",
      "\"Union baristas know their value, and they're not going to accept a proposal that doesn't treat them as true partners,\" said Lynne Fox, president of Workers United.",

      "\"We are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,\" Starbucks said in a statement.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",

    "story": [
      "Frontier Airlines has announced\u00a0an \"all you can fly\" pass for 2025-2026, with the $499 \"GoWild!\" deal including a year's worth of unlimited flights \u2014 with some restrictions.",
      "To be eligible, pass holders must be U.S. residents and members of Frontier Miles, the airline's loyalty program, before they purchase the annual membership. If they're not members, they'll automatically be enrolled.",
      "The pass had been available for $299 for a limited window, which expired yesterday. At $499, it's still discounted from its typical price of $699.",
      "\"The GoWild! Pass is perfect for spontaneous adventurers, budget-savvy travelers and anyone dreaming of limitless journeys,\" Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement. \"At $299, this is the lowest price we've ever offered, making it easier than ever to explore amazing destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America. This limited-time pricing will only be offered to those who act fast!\"",
      "Here's how the \"Go Wild!\" pass works",
      "Once you purchase the deal, you can book tickets on select Frontier flights for just a penny.",
      "The airline warns that not every flight operated by Frontier is available for booking through the GoWild! pass. Additionally, pass holders must pay any taxes and fees associated with the airfare.",
      "What kind of seat do you get?",
      "GoWild! pass holders cannot reserve seats in advance, nor do their fares include carry-on or checked baggage, although these extras may be purchased separately.",
      "That means customers could end up spending $15 or so on just one flight, after buying the pass. Experts say this is one drawback of the deal, given that Frontier often offers deals as low as $19, which are available to customers who aren't pass holders.",
      "When can I book flights?",
      "The unlimited pass allows travelers to make reservations the day before a flight's departure for domestic travel, and ten days before an international flight's departure date.",
      "The pass is valid for travel between May 1, 2025, and April 30, 2026, Frontier said.",
      "These restrictions could deter some fliers from purchasing the all-you-can-fly pass.",
      "\"For a certain subset of traveler, this to be really good value,\" said Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com. \"I think of the 22-year-old who just graduated, is a remote worker and might be able to get really good value out of this.\"",
      "For others, not being able to book seats on planes ahead on one's trip might be a deal breaker.",
      "There are also certain blackout dates around holidays and other busy travel periods, during which the GoWild! Pass cannot be redeemed for a plane ticket. Additionally, pass holders cannot purchase tickets on behalf of other travelers.",
      "The pass automatically renews for a fee of $699, according to the airline.",
      "Frontier first offered the annual pass in 2022, which was valid for travel in 2023. Low-cost carriers have struggled to attract customers of late, as fliers increasingly turn to premium travel offerings, and even legacy carriers introduce new, bare-bones ticket options to compete for budget-conscious customers.",

      "The capybara \u2014 a semi-aquatic South American relative of the guinea pig \u2014 is the latest in a long line of \"it\" animals to get star treatment during the holiday shopping season.",
      "Shoppers can find capybara slippers, purses, robes and bath bombs. There are cuddly plush capybaras and stretchy or squishy ones. Tiny capybaras wander across bedding, T-shirts, phone cases, mugs, key chains, crochet patterns and almost any other type of traditional gift item. Last year, it was the axolotl that took pride of place on many products, and the endangered amphibian remains popular. Owls, hedgehogs, foxes and sloths also had recent turns in the spotlight.",

      "Trendy animals and animal-like creatures aren't a new retail phenomenon; think the talking Teddy Ruxpin toys of the 1980s or Furby and Beanie Babies a decade later. But industry experts say social media is amplifying which animals are hot \u2014 or not.",
      "\"It's really the launch on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms that allow these characters or animals to blow up like crazy,\" said Richard Derr, who has owned a Learning Express Toys franchise in Lake Zurich, Ill., for nearly 30 years and is also a regional manager for the specialty toy store chain.",
      "Social media is also speeding up the cycle. Must-have animals may only last a season before something new captures customers' imaginations.",
      "\"It's really important to keep feeding that beast,\" Juli Lennett, a vice president and toy industry advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \"If you are an influencer, you're not going to talk about last year's stuff.\"",
      "Skyrocketing plush toy sales \u2014 fueled by a need for comfort during the pandemic \u2014 are also increasing the demand for new and interesting varieties, Lennett said. In the first nine months of this year, sales of plush animals were up 115% from the same period in 2019, she said. Overall toy sales rose 38% in that time.",
      "Consumers are seeking out increasingly exotic species that they see in online videos, games and movies. Highland cows, red pandas and axolotls, a type of salamander native to Mexico, have all popped up in popular culture. According to Google Trends, searches for axolotls shot up in June 2021 after Minecraft added them to its game.",
      "\"Nobody knew what an axolotl was in 2020,\" Derr said. \"Now, everybody knows axolotls.\"",
      "Cassandra Clayton, a Vermont Teddy Bear Company product designer, said rising sales to adults are also fueling the demand for unique \u2013 and collectible \u2013 plush toys.",
      "\"Stuffed animals are really becoming an ageless item,\" she said. \"Especially with the boom of self-care in adults and turning towards comfort objects to help de-stress and relax in your life.\"",
      "Clayton expects demand for unusual stuffed animals to continue to grow. Among the oddest she has seen: a stuffed version of a water bear, a type of microorganism also known as a moss piglet or a tardigrade.",
      "\"It doesn't necessarily inspire you to cuddle with them, but you're really seeing the industry start turning towards those characters,\" she said. \"I think that's the next trend.\"",
      "Figuring out the next \"it\" animal \u2014 or microorganism \u2014 is a challenge for toy makers.",
      "\"You never know exactly when they're going to hit and how big they're going to be,\" said Sharon Price John, the president and CEO of Build-A-Bear Workshop, a chain of nearly 500 stores that offers an expanding menagerie of animals and characters for customers to customize, including capybaras and axolotls.",
      "The St. Louis-based company watches social media and gets ideas from talking to store employees and patrons, John said. It usually takes Build-A-Bear up to a year to introduce a new stuffed toy, she said, but the company can move faster if it spots a trend. It sometimes tests a small batch online to make sure a trend is sticking, John said.",
      "Annual trade shows in Asia, Germany and elsewhere are another place to spot new trends. Punirunes \u2013 digital, interactive pets that also come in plush varieties \u2013 are big in Japan right now and will likely take off in the U.S., toy store owner Derr said.",
      "\"Here, I can't give them away. They're too new. But give it a year or two,\" he said.",
      "Companies can kick off their own trends too. Build-A-Bear's Spring Green Frog, introduced in 2020, was an immediate hit thanks to videos posted by customers. It remains popular, with nearly 2 million sold, John said.",
      "John suspects people are drawn to friendly, slow-moving capybaras because watching videos of them are so relaxing. But shoppers who want one need to act fast. A Build-A-Bear holiday capybara with red and green sprinkles on its fur \u2013 dubbed a \"cookiebara\" \u2013 has already sold out, she said.",

      "Americans are being urged not to buy or use liquid-burning portable firepits sold for tabletops and other uses following the deaths of two people and dozens of injuries.",
      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",
      "Married for 71 years, McEneaney's 93-year-old parents died three days apart a week after the accident from third-degree burn injuries.",
      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",
      "Little opted to share what happened to her while noticing the popularity of the firepits while shopping for the holidays.",
      "\"When I search Yankee swap gifts under $30, it's pretty much the No. 1 gift that comes up right now,\" Little said. \"A lot of different companies are making them.\"",
      "The CPSC recently warned against FLIKRFIRE Tabletop Fireplaces and announced the recall of Colsen-branded firepits after a series of alarming incidents left 19 people with burn injuries, with some requiring surgery and others permanently disfigured.",
      "Fire pits that require pouring isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or other liquid fuel into an open container or bowl and then ignite the pooled liquid in the same location in which it was poured violate voluntary safety requirements.",
      "Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol/bioethanol, and similar liquid fuels burn with flame temperatures over 1,600\u00b0F and can cause third-degree burns in less than one second. Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters says workers at seven Amazon facilities went on strike Thursday morning in an effort by the union to pressure the e-commerce giant for a labor agreement during a key shopping period. People have begun picketing in some locations, including one in the New York City borough of Queens.",
      "The Teamsters say the workers, who authorized walkouts in the past few days, are hitting the pavement after Amazon ignored a Dec. 15 deadline the union set for contract negotiations. Amazon says it doesn't expect any impact on its operations during what the union calls the largest strike against the company in U.S. history.",

      "At a warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island, thousands of workers who voted for the Amazon Labor Union in 2022 have since affiliated with the Teamsters. At the other facilities, employees \u2014 including many delivery drivers \u2014 have unionized with them by demonstrating majority support but without holding government-administered elections.",

      "Why are Amazon workers striking?",
      "\"Amazon is pushing its workers closer to the picket line by failing to show them the respect they have earned,\" Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien said in a statement.",

      "The Seattle-based online retailer has been seeking to re-do the election that led to the union victory at the warehouse on Staten Island, which the Teamsters now represent. In the process, the company has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement.",
      "\"The truth is that the Teamsters have actively threatened, intimidated, and attempted to coerce Amazon employees and third-party drivers to join them, which is illegal and is the subject of multiple pending unfair labor practice charges against the union,\" Nantel added.",
      "The Teamsters have argued Amazon essentially controls everything the drivers do and should be classified as an employer.",
      "Some U.S. labor regulators have sided with the union in filings made before the NLRB. In September, Amazon boosted pay for the drivers amid the growing pressure.",

A month ago, the majority saw at least two cuts in 2025 as a safe bet.

      "The Fed said Wednesday it's cutting its benchmark interest rate for a third time this year, continuing the sharp turnaround begun in September when it started lowering rates  from a two-decade high to support the job market. Wall Street loves lower interest rates, but the Dec. 18 cut had been widely expected by Wall Street.",
      "Why is the stock market down today?",
      "Investors were unsettled by the Fed's forecast for fewer cuts in 2025, even though many economists had already been paring their expectations given sticky inflation.",
      "\"Markets have a really bad of habit of overreacting to Fed policy moves,\" Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an analyst note. \"The Fed didn't do or say anything that deviated from what the market expected\u2014this seems more like, I'm leaving for Christmas break, so I'll sell and start up next year.\"",
      "The bigger question centers on how much more the Fed could cut next year. A lot is riding on it, particularly after expectations for a series of cuts in 2025 helped the U.S. stock market set an all-time high 57 times so far in 2024.",
      "Fed officials released projections on Wednesday showing the median expectation among them is for two more cuts to the federal funds rate in 2025, or half a percentage point's worth. That's down from the four cuts they had expected just three months ago.",

      "Asked why Fed officials are looking to slow their pace of cuts, Powell pointed to how the job market looks to be performing well overall and how recent inflation readings have picked up. He also cited uncertainties that will require policy makers to react to upcoming, to-be-determined changes in the economy.",
      "While lower rates can goose the economy by making it cheaper to borrow and boosting prices for investments, they can also offer more fuel for inflation.",

      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.35% from 4.25%.",
      "On Wall Street, stocks of companies that can feel the most pressure from higher interest rates fell to some of the worst losses.",
      "Stocks of smaller companies did particularly poorly, for example. Many need to borrow to fuel their growth, meaning they can feel more pain when having to pay higher interest rates for loans. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 4.4%.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, General Mills dropped 3.1% despite reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. The maker of Progresso soups and Cheerios said it will increase its investments in brands to help them grow, which pushed it to cut its forecast for profit this fiscal year.",
      "Nvidia, the superstar stock  responsible for a chunk of Wall Street's rally to records in recent years, fell 1.1% to extend its weekslong funk. It has dropped more than 13% from its record set last month and fallen in nine of the last 10 days as its big momentum slows.",
      "\"As we wrote in our 2025 outlook a couple of weeks ago, stretched positioning and sentiment left stocks vulnerable to a sell-off,\" Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial said in a note about today's market sell-off. \"The big jump in inflation expectations and related bond sell-off was a convenient excuse.

      "\"It's pretty clear we've avoided a recession \u2014 growth this year has been solid,\" Powell said. \"Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable,\" while other countries have contended with slow growth and \"struggles with inflation.\"",
      "He added, \"I expect another good year next year.\"",
      "As far as Trump's stated plans to enact broad-based tariffs, which many economists forecast could prove inflationary, if enacted, Powell said the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed is examining the potential impact from tariffs, but it will be \"quite some time\" until there are policies put into place by the second Trump administration for the central bank to examine, Powell added.",
      "\"We just don't know very much at all about the actual policies \u2014 we don't know how much will be tariffed, from which countries,\" he noted. \"We don't know if there will be retaliatory tariffs.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:07:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" said an 84-year-old woman whose late husband's Social Security benefits were slashed. \"It's not fair.\"",
    "story": [
      "At 84 years old, Evelyn Paternostro spends her days working part time as a cashier at Dollar Tree. For decades, she dedicated her life to education, serving as a teacher and principal in Louisiana. But despite years of her public service, she now struggles to make ends meet.",
      "\"People at the store ask me all the time, 'Are you doing this for fun? Why aren't you retired?'\" she said. \"Because I need to eat.\"",
      "After her husband died, Paternostro discovered she couldn't collect his Social Security benefits due to a pair of federal policies called the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "These provisions reduce or eliminate Social Security\u00a0benefits\u00a0for millions of Americans if they receive a public pension that didn't withhold Social Security tax. Retired teachers, firefighters and other public servants are some of the most impacted.",
      "\"I was really blindsided,\" she said. \"I knew I was going to have a teacher's retirement. I was going to be part of the Louisiana Teachers Retirement System. And I never really thought about my husband's income and what that would mean to me.\"",
      "Who is affected?",
      "Nearly 2.8 million individuals across the United States are impacted by WEP and GPO. Its effects extend to all employees of state, county, municipal and special districts in 26 states. Teachers in 13 of those states, including specific districts in Kentucky and Georgia, also feel its impact.",
      "In Massachusetts and certain districts in Rhode Island, not all municipal employees, but only teachers are impacted.",
      "The purpose of these two 1980s-era programs was \"so that there was no way you could 'double dip' into both a federal pension and Social Security,\" explains Jill Schlesinger, CBS News business analyst.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision affects people who qualify for Social Security benefits through their job but also receive a pension from another job where they didn't pay into Social Security.",
      "It may decrease their Social Security payments by up to half the value of their pension.",
      "For example, Michelle Cosgrove's benefits will be cut nearly in half \u2014 reduced by $557, to $601.",
      "Cosgrove spent the first half of her career as a paralegal, contributing to Social Security, before staying home to raise her children.",
      "Later, she became a public school teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area, paying into CalSTRS, California's educator pension fund. However, her plans for retirement took an unexpected turn when she discovered the intricacies of the pension system.",
      "When she retired, Cosgrove's reduced payments affected her ability to pay bills and cover expenses.",
      "The other program, the Government Pension Offset, further impacted Cosgrove after her husband, Mike, passed away in 2022. Despite working in the private sector for decades and contributing to Social Security, his benefits were largely inaccessible to her due to the GPO. Mike, a welding supervisor, was diagnosed with a rare cancer at 52 but continued working until his health worsened. He died at the age of 63.",
      "If pension recipients are a widow or widower of someone who received Social Security benefits, that pension recipient may have reduced survivors benefits or may not receive benefits at all.",
      "\"If I'd have stayed home and done nothing, I'd have gotten all the money,\" Cosgrove said. \"Had I known this, I might not have gone into teaching. I'd have picked something different.\"",
      "The GPO mainly affects women, with 83% of those impacted by GPO being female, according data from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"When you see the numbers of the GPO elevated, it's because many of those people were probably teachers and married to somebody who worked in a Social Security job,\" said Joslyn DeLancey, vice president of the Connecticut Education Association. \"They're not going to get that spousal Social Security. \u2026 It's such a messy and nuanced thing.\"",
      "Paternostro estimates she would have received $2,500 a month in Social Security benefits \u2014 about $300,000 over the last decade.",
      "\"That's a lot of money,\" she said. \"That's more money than I can imagine.\"",
      "But these policies brought a different kind of heartache for Dede Ruel, a retired school psychologist in Illinois.",
      "She said she recently received a letter from Social Security informing her that she owed more than $13,000, reducing her Social Security checks by 21%.",
      "According to a CBS News analysis of federal data, these policies are one of the most common reasons for Social Security overpayments, which have totaled more than $450 million in fiscal years 2017-2021.",
      "\"I have been trying to appeal it through their process and I've been denied at every level,\" Ruel said.",
      "The Social Security Administration's press office provided comments after the initial publication of this story, stating that \"state and local government employers are\u00a0required\u00a0to disclose potential effects of WEP/GPO on newly hired non-covered employees.\"",
      "\"We work to pay the right people the right amounts at the right time, and Social Security issues correct payments in most cases,\" a Social Security spokesperson said. \"However, there is room to improve, as people count on the agency to prevent overpayments and underpayments from happening.\"",
      "Bipartisan support for the Social Security Fairness Act",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act, one of the most bipartisan bills in Congress this session, aims to repeal WEP and GPO.",
      "The House\u00a0voted\u00a0to pass the legislation Nov. 12. The Senate is expected to vote on the Social Security Fairness Act this week.",
      "Social Security is projected to run out of funds in 2035 unless there is a change made to the fund's cost and revenue system.",
      "Even though supporters of the Social Security Fairness Act argue it will only drain the Social Security fund six months earlier than otherwise expected, some critics believe there are better solutions, suggesting states should restructure their retirement systems to address the root causes rather than rely on federal fixes.",
      "\"A lot of the critics say this is gonna cost a lot of money, almost $200 billion dollars over the next 10 years,\" explains Schlesinger. \"Critics say there is a reason why we force people to pay into the Social Security system. These are two separate systems. If we need to fix Social Security, let's fix it. Let's not just do a repeal which is essentially a Band-Aid.\"",
      "Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who spearheaded the bill, said, \"People should receive benefits based on what they paid into the system. That's what the formula should largely be based upon. I understand the efforts back in the '70s and '80s, but the overcorrection has likely taken $600 to $700 billion in benefits from these folks.\"",
      "Devin Carroll, a financial planner, encounters many clients who are \"completely taken by surprise.\" Carroll often instructs his clients to use the Social Security Administration's WEP calculator, a tool that calculates benefits with the impact of the WEP factored in.",
      "Carroll explains that it can be challenging to figure out future Social Security benefits. The benefits formula includes \"bend points,\" which are adjusted annually based on wage inflation.",
      "These adjustments are crucial because the actual amount of the WEP reduction is determined the year a person turns 62.",
      "\"You have to make some projections, some assumptions about forward-looking inflation, both price inflation and wage inflation,\" Carroll explained. \"Once you do, then you can start to work through that and use a calculator like the SSA has that will do a lot of that for you, and it will tell you what your WEP adjusted for retirement age benefit should be.\"",
      "Carroll also gets to see the impacts of these provisions firsthand. His daughter-in-law is a teacher in Texas and his son is a firefighter in Texas.",
      "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" Paternostro said. \"It's not fair.\"",

Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate.

    "title": "How TikTok could avoid being banned in the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson emerged from a meeting with his fellow Republicans on Friday and said he believed lawmakers will manage to avoid a\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0ahead of the midnight deadline.",
      "\"There is a unanimous agreement in the room that we need to move forward. I will not telegraph to you the specific details of that yet, because I've got a couple of things I got to wrap up in a few moments upstairs, but I expect that we will be proceeding forward,\" the speaker said. \"We will not have a government shutdown, and we will meet our obligations.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said there would \"very likely\" be a vote Friday afternoon.",
      "On Thursday, the GOP majority tried to fast-track a measure that would keep the government funded and\u00a0raise the debt ceiling, a demand issued at the 11th hour by President-elect Donald Trump that upended negotiations. Dozens of Republicans voted against the measure, and only two Democrats supported it.",
      "Johnson presented his latest plan at Friday's meeting, according to lawmakers who spoke to reporters. Two members said Republicans planned to resurrect the bill that failed on Thursday, minus the debt ceiling suspension. That would leave three major parts: a clean short-term extension of government funding, billions of dollars in disaster relief and billions more in aid to farmers.",
      "But the situation remained fluid as the afternoon unfolded and there was no immediate public reaction from Trump, who has pushed hard for a vote to abolish or suspend the debt ceiling before he takes office. Addressing the debt limit would not happen under the plan that Johnson presented to members \u2014 instead, Republicans would commit to tackling it in a tax bill next year.",
      "Government funding will technically lapse at midnight Friday night absent a funding extension. But most of the effects of a shutdown wouldn't begin to be felt until Monday morning, potentially giving lawmakers some breathing room if an impasse stretches past the deadline.",
      "Any bill to keep the government funded will still need approval from the Democratic-controlled Senate and President Biden. Democrats began the day Friday by pushing Republicans to bring up the original deal they supported, but they haven't ruled out supporting a version of the bill without the debt ceiling.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said shortly before noon that the \"lines of communication have been reopened\" but he had not yet seen a plan. He reiterated that addressing the debt limit now would be \"premature.\" Democrats are reluctant to take the debt ceiling off the table now, when it could be used as leverage during Trump's upcoming presidency.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president spoke Friday with both Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and placed responsibility squarely on Republicans.",
      "\"This is a mess that Speaker Johnson created, that is his mess to fix,\" she said. \"There was a deal on the table.\"",
      "Chaos on Capitol Hill",
      "The House descended into chaos Wednesday when a\u00a0GOP revolt\u00a0spurred by Trump and Elon Musk sank the original deal that Johnson had spent weeks negotiating with Democrats.",
      "Johnson then brought up the new version the next day. The legislation would have extended government funding for three months, suspended the debt limit until January 2027 and provided $110 billion in disaster aid. It also included health care policy extenders, funding for rebuilding Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge and a renewal of the farm bill for one year.",
      "Those proposals were all in the original deal, but billions of dollars that Democrats had demanded were cut out. Johnson defended the bill Thursday night before the vote, saying some bipartisan measures were still included.",
      "\"The only change in this legislation is that we are going to push the debt limit to Jan. 30 of 2027,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said. The second\u00a0version\u00a0was considerably slimmer, at 116 pages compared to the 1,547 pages of the original continuing resolution. Trump\u00a0immediately backed it, calling it a \"SUCCESS\" and \"a very good deal.\"",
      "But 38 House Republicans and nearly all Democrats rejected it. Jeffries said the proposal was \"laughable.\" After the failed vote, Schumer said that \"now it's time to go back to the bipartisan agreement.\"",

      "\"Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling. Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is President,\" he wrote.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:10:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Historians say Trump falsely said he was the only president to collect revenue from tariffs on Chinese goods, among other claims.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump made claims about the history of U.S. tariff collection as he defended his plan to raise tariffs on goods from countries like China and Mexico in a news conference this week, claims historians say are at odds with the facts.",
      "In particular, Trump exaggerated the impact of tariff hikes during his first term, falsely claiming that \"no other president took in 10 cents\" of revenue from trade collections on Chinese imports. Trump also pointed to 19th-century tariff increases championed by former President William McKinley as evidence that his plan could benefit the economy.",
      "But data shows the federal government had been taking in billions in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports long before Trump came to office, and historians say the high tariff era of the 1890s was economically rocky for Americans.",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports, often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "In his next term, Trump has pledged to put an additional 10% levy on all Chinese goods, along with a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada. Americans spend more than $1 trillion on goods from those three countries each year, according to data from the Census Bureau.",
      "What Trump gets wrong about history of tariffs on China",
      "In his news conference this week, Trump repeated a claim he made frequently on the campaign trail: that his predecessors essentially took in no money from tariffs on Chinese goods, while his administration took in billions.",
      "Tariffs on Chinese imports have existed since the 1700s, generating billions in revenue for years before Trump came into office.",
      "During President Barack Obama's final year in office, tariff revenue from Chinese imports totaled over $12 billion, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. That amount increased after Trump's first round of tariff hikes to over $22 billion, the same federal data shows.",
      "Trump did dramatically raise the total revenue generated from Chinese imports by adding tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars'\u00a0worth of goods. However, even with that increase, tariff collections have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue at any point in the last 70 years, according to the Congressional Research Service this month.",
      "The president-elect has argued his tariff plan for his next term could bring in revenue to help defray the cost of income tax cuts.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs estimated that Trump's proposed levies on goods from China, Mexico and Canada could generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year, which would be up from $77 billion in fiscal year 2024.",
      "But tariffs had not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, said Judith Goldstein, a political science professor at Stanford.",
      "\"As the U.S. became more involved in the world, the effect of tariffs on domestic production and prices were increasingly a problem,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Trump has also repeatedly argued his tariff plan will help protect U.S. companies. There's some evidence that the customs duties he imposed in his first term boosted jobs in specific industries like washing machine manufacturing, according to research from the Brookings Institution, a think tank. However, manufacturers also faced higher costs for raw materials and retaliatory tariffs from other nations, according to the Federal Reserve.",
      "What Trump gets wrong about the McKinley tariffs",
      "This week, Trump also cited McKinley's 1890 tariff hikes as evidence that these customs taxes can enrich the U.S.",
      "\"You go back and look at the 1890s, 1880s, McKinley, and you take a look at tariffs, that was when we were proportionately the richest,\" Trump said.",
      "In 1890, tariff hikes raised the average duties on foreign imports from 38% to nearly 50%. McKinley, a representative for Ohio at the time, pushed for the taxes to protect his state's steelworkers from foreign competition, according to Dartmouth College economics professor Doug Irwin.",
      "However, the decade that followed these hikes was marked by economic trouble.",
      "\"The U.S. went into a depression in 1893, and we didn't really emerge out of it until the mid-1890s. So in general the 1890s was not a great decade for the U.S. economy,\" Irwin said.",
      "Additionally, McKinley's tariff bill raised prices of goods like shoes and clothes, leading to voter backlash that cost Republicans 93 seats in the next election, according to the House of Representatives\u00a0Office of the Historian.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for clarification on why he said America was \"proportionately the richest\" after this bill passed.",
      "Historic data shows gross domestic product per capita for Americans has vastly increased from about $6,400 in the early 1890s (in 2017 dollars) to roughly $69,000 today (in 2024 dollars).",
      "\"It is unclear why he's picking on the 1890s as this golden age. It wasn't considered good times, at least by the people living through it at the time,\" Irwin said.",

      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit as \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "JPMorgan also accused the agency of pursuing a \"political agenda,\" stating that the agency was \"overreaching its authority by making banks accountable for criminals, even including romance scammers.\"",
      "JPMorgan Chase said it prevents nearly $20 billion in fraud attempts each year, and that 99.95% of its transactions are completed without dispute.",
      "A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of customers filed fraud complaints and were denied assistance by Zelle and the three banks, according to the suit, which noted that some people were advised to contact those behind the fraud to get their money back.",
      "Zelle \"has been slow to implement anti-fraud measures, including closing accounts accused of fraud,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report, pointing to the CFPB's allegations. \"It also permitted the registration of emails that were impersonating legitimate entities, including Zelle itself.\"",
      "Since Zelle launched in 2017, according to the CFPB, JPMorgan Chase received 420,00 customer complaints involving more than $360 million; Bank of America heard from 210,000 customers with more than $290 million in fraud losses; and Wells Fargo tallied $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 people.",
      "\"These troubling alleged practices need to be addressed by all parties as quickly as possible,\" Mike Litt, consumer campaign director at US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. \"It's crucial that in our increasingly cashless age, we have digital financial systems that the public can trust and use without fear of losing their money.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 14:39:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans in the House are working to craft a plan to avert a government shutdown just hours before funding for agencies is set to lapse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned Friday that his agency could suffer \"serious\" consequences if Congress fails to pass legislation funding federal agencies and averting a government shutdown in the next few hours.",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Mayorkas said many components of the Department of Homeland Security would be affected by a lapse in funding, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), FEMA and Border Patrol.",
      "The homeland security chief added that a failure by lawmakers to pass a stopgap spending bill before Saturday would also mean staff at the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office would be redirected to other parts of his department.",
      "\"The implications and the consequences are serious, especially when it comes to Homeland Security,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "He urged Congress to approve legislation that would keep government agencies operating before midnight, when a short-term extension enacted in September will expire.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled earlier this week a legislative package negotiated with Democrats that would have extended government funding through March 14, provided more than $100 billion in disaster aid for states impacted by extreme weather events, and given members of Congress a pay raise, among other provisions.",
      "But the proposal was swiftly met with pushback from some conservative Republicans, who balked at the size and scope of the 1,550 page deal. Crucially, it was also criticized by billionaire Elon Musk, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, and then by the incoming president himself.",
      "Trump and Musk torpedoed the package, with Musk taking to X, the social media platform he owns, to lambaste provisions of it. The president-elect further upended negotiations over a funding deal when he called on Republicans to address the debt limit \u2014 which is set to be reinstated Jan. 1 \u2014 in their plan.",
      "Johnson unveiled a second measure Thursday, which would have funded the government for three months, suspended the nation's borrowing limit until January 2027 and provided $110 billion in disaster relief. The more tailored legislation, which Trump backed, also included health care provisions, a one-year renewal of the farm bill and funding for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which collapsed in March.",
      "But that package failed to pass the House with the necessary support after it was opposed by most Democrats and more than three dozen Republicans.",
      "That defeat sent Johnson and GOP leaders back to the drawing board, with the prospect of a shutdown rising with each passing hour. Republicans are now discussing voting on three provisions of the package individually, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News: a clean extension of government funding; billions of dollars in disaster aid; and assistance to farmers.",
      "Mayorkas told \"Face the Nation\" that a shutdown just before the holidays \u2014 when tens of millions of Americans are traveling \u2014 would mean TSA employees at airports throughout the country would be forced to work without pay. However, they would likely receive backpay after a shutdown ends, as has happened before after previous funding lapses.",
      "\"We're going to have tens of thousands of TSA employees working an incredibly high volume of passenger traffic throughout our airports across the country, and they will be doing so keeping the American public safe without pay,\" he said.",
      "The Homeland Security secretary also said those impacted would include U.S. Border Patrol agents stationed along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"There are people in government service who are dedicating their talent and their energy to the well-being of the American people, who rely on their paychecks to make ends meet, and it is the holiday season, after all, but our men and women on the border will be guarding the border of the United States at no pay if funding doesn't come through,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "The $110 billion in disaster assistance that will likely be included in a spending deal includes money for FEMA, which has been responding to the hurricanes that devastated the southeast this fall.",
      "Mayorkas said that inaction by Congress would impact those states hit by the storms, including North Carolina and Florida.",
      "\"What FEMA will need to do, another significant impact of the failure to fund the federal government, is they will now need to delay \u2014 they'll put on pause certain contracts, certain projects that are actually repairing communities devastated by extreme weather events, by tornados, by hurricanes, by fires, and that will delay the rebuilding of communities and really delay the ability to deliver for people who have suffered so much,\" he said.",
      "Mayorkas said a shutdown occurring over the holidays would force the Department of Homeland Security to \"make difficult decisions now to delay projects.\"",
      "Lawmakers representing those storm-ravaged states have pushed for disaster relief to be included in any legislative package funding the government.",

    "title": "Why Trump wants Congress to abolish the debt ceiling",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 13:44:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump added a wrinkle to negotiations over a deal to fund the government when he called for an increase to the debt ceiling.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk blew up a GOP-backed deal to fund federal agencies into March, raising the pressure on Republican congressional leaders to craft a plan to avert a government shutdown just before the holidays.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Trump and Vance lambasted the original agreement for including provisions favored by Democrats. But the incoming president and vice president also added a new, significant wrinkle to negotiations when they urged Congress to raise or abolish the debt ceiling now, instead of next year.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" Trump and Vance said in their statement. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate now.\"",
      "House GOP leadership responded to Trump's push to address the nation's borrowing limit with a proposal that would fund federal agencies until mid-March, suspend the debt limit for two years and provide $110 billion in disaster aid, among other provisions. But the plan failed on the House floor, with 38 Republicans joining nearly all Democrats in voting against it despite Trump endorsing it.",
      "Lawmakers are returning to Capitol Hill on Friday, hours before the government shuts down absent legislative action, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said \"we've got a plan.\"",
      "What is the debt ceiling?",
      "Set by Congress, the debt ceiling, or limit, is the maximum amount of money the U.S. Treasury is authorized to borrow to pay debts incurred by the federal government. Lifting the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending, but instead lets the government spend money on obligations that Congress has already approved.",
      "Failing to address the debt ceiling could lead the U.S. to default on its debt, which would have devastating effects on the economy. The government has never defaulted, and the Treasury typically uses accounting moves, known as \"extraordinary measures,\" to delay breaching the debt ceiling.",
      "While raising the debt ceiling used to be routine, legislation addressing it has in recent years been used as leverage to force policy concessions and fuel debates over government spending.",
      "Congress last addressed the debt ceiling in June 2023 as part of a legislative package negotiated by President Biden and then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. That deal suspended the debt ceiling through Jan., 1, 2025, ensuring any fight over it would take place after the 2024 elections.",
      "The Treasury Department will likely implement extraordinary measures to stave off a default in the new year. It will also announce an \"X date,\" the estimated point at which the government will no longer be able to pay its obligations. The Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, projected in an analysis released Monday that it's possible the debt limit will be reached by June 16.",
      "While the Treasury Department's use of extraordinary measures would give Congress more time to address the debt ceiling, Trump is now urging lawmakers to take action now, before he takes office.",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power to borrow on behalf of the U.S., and Congress has delegated that authority to the executive branch, while placing a limit on the amount of debt that can be outstanding. Lawmakers could pass a bill to repeal the debt limit, and proposals to do so were introduced by Democrats in the House and Senate in the past several legislative sessions, although they all failed.",
      "Why does Trump want to raise the debt ceiling?",
      "The president-elect will come into office with a legislative to-do list that includes securing the border and extending provisions of his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in 2017 and overhauled the tax code. But a fight over the debt ceiling could complicate efforts by the Republican-led House and Senate to focus on those legislative initiatives and pass them quickly.",
      "Trump is urging lawmakers to eliminate the debt ceiling altogether, a position that some prominent Democrats have endorsed in the past.",
      "\"Number one, the debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely,\" Trump said in a phone interview Thursday with CBS News' Robert Costa. \"Number two, a lot of the different things they thought they'd receive [in a recently proposed spending deal] are now going to be thrown out, 100 percent. And we'll see what happens. We'll see whether or not we have a closure during the Biden administration. But if it's going to take place, it's going to take place during Biden, not during Trump.\"",
      "Trump separately told ABC News that \"there won't be anything approved unless the debt ceiling is done with,\" indicating any spending deal to prevent a shutdown must address the debt limit.",
      "\"If we don't get it, then we're going to have a shutdown, but it'll be a Biden shutdown, because shutdowns only [injure] the person who's president,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Hours after the funding proposal backed by Trump failed on the House floor, the president-elect suggested that lawmakers should suspend the debt ceiling for four years, the length of his second term.",
      "\"Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling. Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is president,\" he wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "Fiscal conservatives in the House have balked at the notion of raising or suspending the borrowing limit without spending reforms, and debates over the debt limit often give way to broader fights over the federal budget, which Republicans in Congress have said is bloated and should be reduced. Plus, Democrats still control the Senate and the White House.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Wednesday that shutting down the government would harm families and endanger services Americans rely on.",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" she said. \"President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Vance ordered Republicans to shut down the government and they are threatening to do just that \u2014 while undermining communities recovering from disasters, farmers and ranchers, and community health centers.\"",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries suggested Democrats would not go along with a plan pushed by Republicans to raise the debt limit.",
      "\"GOP extremists want House Democrats to raise the debt ceiling so that House Republicans can lower the amount of your Social Security check. Hard pass,\" the New York Democrat wrote on the social media platform Bluesky.",
      "Jeffries also told reporters \"the debt limit issue and discussion is premature at best.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could face a shutdown at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21, 2024. Here's what could be impacted.",
    "story": [
      "With one federal spending bill\u00a0now scrapped\u00a0and a revised version voted down on Thursday night, the U.S. faces a possible government shutdown that could begin at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21, when current funding is set to lapse. That raises questions about what types of services and payments could be impacted just days before the holidays.",
      "A looming shutdown stems from controversy over a spending bill that would have extended funding through March 14, but which was nixed by House Speaker Mike Johnson after some Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending that had been added to the bill.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a billionaire who spent almost $300 million to back Trump and other Republican candidates in the November election, had also voiced opposition to the spending bill, which he called \"terrible.\" When the measure was scrapped, Musk proclaimed on X, \"The voice of the people has triumphed!\"",
      "House Republicans on Friday regrouped after the failed vote on Thursday evening, with Johnson telling reporters at the Capitol he's \"expecting votes this morning, so stay tuned \u2014 we've got a plan.\" House Republicans are set to gather on Capitol Hill at 12:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically barred from doling out money, although there are some exceptions, such as activities to protect life and property. At the same time, agencies must make decisions about which workers will stay on the job, which can lead to varying impacts on government operations.",
      "\"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans or government benefits,\" David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this year in a blog post.",
      "Here's what could be impacted if the U.S. government shuts down on Dec. 21.",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "If the federal government shuts down, each federal agency will determine its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, although government operations deemed nonessential will stop happening.",
      "Many government workers will be furloughed, although those providing essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control will continue to report to their jobs. For instance, essential government agencies like the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard would remain open.",
      "However, none of those federal workers would get paid until Congress approves a new spending bill. After the shutdown ends, workers will receive retroactive paychecks covering the days they were furloughed or had to work without pay, according to the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "That could create hardships for some government workers, as occurred during a shutdown that stretched for more than 30 days, starting on Dec. 22, 2018. During that stoppage, many federal workers turned to food pantries and other forms of aid to get through the several weeks when they didn't receive paychecks.",
      "Is Social Security affected by a government shutdown?",
      "The nation's 67 million Social Security recipients would continue to receive their checks even if the government closes for business. Medicare will also continue to operate, which means seniors covered by the health care plan won't have their medications or treatments impacted.",
      "That's because both Social Security and Medicare benefits are authorized by laws that don't require annual approval.",
      "Even so, Social Security's administrative budget is discretionary, which means it needs approval from Congress, according to the AARP. As a result, some services offered by the Social Security Administration could be impacted in a shutdown, such as benefit verification and new applications for benefits, the group says.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect the TSA or air travel?",
      "With millions of Americans expected to travel over the holidays, there are plenty of questions about how a shutdown could impact air travel. Because they provide essential services, air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"We expect to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2,\" a TSA spokesperson said. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.\"",
      "Does the USPS deliver mail in a government shutdown?",
      "Yes, because the U.S. Postal Service is an independent agency. In previous shutdowns, operations have continued. That means mail would still be delivered, and post offices will remain open.",
      "Does the military get paid in a government shutdown?",
      "Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement would continue to work, but would not be paid until Congress signs off on new spending. But most civilian personnel working for the U.S. Department of Defense would be furloughed.",
      "Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department are expected to start alerting workers about shutdown protocols on Thursday, according to the Military Times. The impact would likely be felt in the first week of January when the first military paychecks of 2025 will be deposited, which are scheduled to include a 4.5% pay increase for all troops, the publication noted.",
      "What closes in a government shutdown?",
      "Many services would be put on hold or delayed if there is a shutdown, including environmental and food inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy group that focuses on federal spending.",
      "The national parks would likely close, while the National Institutes of Health could also be impacted, the group noted.",
      "While taxes are still due, such as quarterly estimated payments due on Jan. 15, the IRS could also be impacted by furloughs, although tax filing season typically doesn't kick off until late January. Still, a shutdown plan published earlier this year notes that many IRS functions would cease, including tax audits and services such as answering calls from taxpayers.",
      "How long could a government shutdown last?",
      "The odds of a government shutdown have increased with the latest developments, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Dec. 18 research note. But, they added, \"a protracted shutdown looks unlikely in our view.\"",
      "A spending measure also could be passed before the Dec. 21 deadline if Republicans can revise it to appease Trump, who objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending added to the bill, Goldman's analysts added.",
      "\"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components \u2014 he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid \u2014 so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline, they wrote.",

Only a simple majority is needed for final passage in the Senate in order to pass the bill to President Biden's desk.",

Vance and fellow Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, along with Joe Manchin, an independent and outgoing senator from West Virginia, did not participate in Thursday's vote.",
      "The Senate was scheduled to reconvene on Friday, and is expected to resume consideration of the measure after votes related to confirming two judges to serve in California.",

      "\"This bill will take $200 billion during the 10-year period out of the Social Security trust fund without any way to pay for it,\" the North Carolina Republican added.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Biden administration is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 workers through an existing program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department's announcement Friday targets teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials and others who've reached eligibility through the program, which promises to erase loans after 10 years of work in government or nonprofit jobs.",
      "The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before President Biden leaves office in January. After failing to deliver his promise of widespread loan cancellation, Mr. Biden has instead focused on expanding loan relief through programs that were created before his presidency.",
      "Under Mr. Biden, the Education Department loosened the rules for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which previously had a 99% rejection rate amid burdensome rules and widespread confusion over eligibility requirements.",
      "With the latest round of relief, Mr. Biden has now canceled an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs, covering 4.9 million Americans. That includes $78 billion for roughly 1 million borrowers through the PSLF.",
      "\"From Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 08:24:52 -0500",
    "summary": "ICE deported more than a quarter-million unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2024, the highest tally in a decade.",
    "story": [
      "Deportations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement soared to a 10-year high in fiscal year 2024 under the Biden administration, surpassing the Trump-era high recorded in 2019, according to a government report released Thursday.",
      "ICE deported more than 271,000 unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2024, the highest tally recorded by the agency since fiscal year 2014, when the Obama administration carried out 316,000 deportations. In fiscal year 2019, ICE reported 267,000 deportations, the peak under the Trump administration. Fiscal years start in October and end in September.",
      "While the incoming Trump administration has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in American history next year, the statistics released by ICE show the Biden administration has already overseen a dramatic increase in deportations in its final year in office.",
      "In fiscal year 2021, which included the first months of the Biden administration, ICE deportations plunged to 59,000, a record low for the 21-year-old agency. The drop was mainly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and rules enacted by the Biden administration that efficiently shielded most unauthorized immigrants from deportation if they were not serious criminals, national security threats or recent border crossers.",
      "ICE deportations increased to 72,000 in fiscal year 2022 and then to 143,000 in fiscal year 2023, as the Biden administration increased deportation efforts in response to record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, and as border officials relied less heavily on a pandemic-era expulsion policy known as Title 42. Expulsions of migrants under that measure were not counted as formal deportations because they were carried out under a public health law.",
      "Border crackdown fueled jump in deportations",
      "In the report it released Thursday, ICE said the sharp jump in deportations last fiscal year stemmed from increased steps to streamline the deportation process, as well as diplomatic efforts to convince countries to take back more deportees. The agency noted that it increased deportations flights to traditional migrant-sending countries in Latin America, but also to far-flung nations in Africa and Asia, including China, which did not accept U.S. deportations for years.",
      "Most of the deportations in fiscal year 2024 involved migrants who were apprehended by U.S. border officials, as opposed to those arrested by ICE in the interior of the country, the agency report shows. Roughly 82% of the 271,000 immigrants deported that year were first arrested by Customs and Border Protection. The rest were initially arrested by ICE in jails or during operations in communities.",
      "ICE's deportation numbers don't include removals and returns of migrants by Border Patrol officials at the U.S.-Mexico border. Those returns also increased this year after President Biden sharply limited asylum through a June executive order that, alongside Mexico's efforts to interdict migrants, led to a dramatic decrease in illegal border crossings.",
      "What's awaiting the Trump administration?",
      "While deportations rose significantly this past year, the Trump administration will still inherit a massive workload at ICE, which is tracking millions of unauthorized immigrants.",
      "At the end of fiscal year 2024, ICE's so-called non-detained docket of cases of immigrants facing deportation due to immigration violations had ballooned to nearly 7.7 million, up from 3.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. The spike in cases mainly reflects the record releases of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border during Mr. Biden's presidency before he announced the asylum restrictions in June.",
      "The incoming Trump administration has promised to start a wave of mass deportations as soon as the president-elect takes office on Jan. 20. Incoming border czar Tom Homan has said ICE will first target unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and the estimated 1.4 million people with pending deportation orders. But he has also stressed no one in the country illegally will be exempt from deportation.",
      "To carry out the deportations at the monumental scale that incoming Trump administration officials have outlined, ICE would need a dramatic infusion in resources and manpower, as the agency currently has 41,000 detention beds and roughly 6,000 deportation officers. There were more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in early 2022, according to the latest government estimate.",
      "Homan has suggested enlisting the Department of Defense to help ICE, including by allowing the agency to carry out deportations using military aircraft. Incoming White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has also floated a proposal to deputize National Guard soldiers to arrest and deport immigrants living in the country illegally.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election set in motion a race against time by President Biden to safeguard his environmental legacy in his remaining days as president.",
      "But his administration's stepped-up pace of climate-related announcements will likely mean little once Trump is inaugurated and the Republican-led Congress is seated in January. Mr. Biden's most recent climate initiatives are all but certain to be short-lived, mostly thanks to an obscure law that tends to come into play every four years.",
      "That law, the Congressional Review Act, allows Congress to kill any regulation issued by a federal agency in the last 60 legislative days with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate and the signature of the president.",
      "Since Election Day, the Biden administration has announced final rules that include one to dramatically curb methane emissions and another that bans all future coal mining leases on federal lands. Both rules are expected to be rolled back soon after Trump takes office.",
      "Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide, but it traps heat in the atmosphere at 28 times the rate of carbon dioxide, the Environmental Protection Agency has observed. On the upside, methane doesn't remain in the atmosphere for as long as CO2, so cutting methane emissions can have a much quicker, more dramatic impact on lowering greenhouse gases. Human sources of methane emissions include oil and gas systems, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and a host of other industrial processes.",
      "On Nov. 12, the Biden administration announced a final rule that will charge oil and natural gas companies a hefty fee if they exceed methane emission limits. It's an effort to encourage these companies to improve their processes to reduce methane leaks.",
      "The EPA estimates that implementing the methane emissions rule would be akin to taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.",
      "The Biden administration also recently blocked all new coal mining leases on public lands, which would affect new leases in Wyoming and Montana, the source of 40% of the nation's coal. The Associated Press pointed to government analyses that said ending federal leasing would reduce emissions by the equivalent of 293 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, roughly on par with eliminating emissions from 63 million gas-powered cars.",
      "Existing leases would still allow mining in the region to continue for decades. But coal has been losing ground in recent years, as the U.S. has steadily come to rely more on cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources \u2014 and less on coal.",
      "Republican politicians in Wyoming and Montana denounced the ban, and GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said in a statement that he's ready to work with Trump to reverse the ban and other regulations.",
      "In Trump's view, fears about climate change are overblown or premature. He's called it a \"hoax\" in the past. He opposes clean energy and EV subsidies and has said what America needs to do is \"drill, baby drill\" \u2014 that is, increase traditional oil and gas production in order to bring down energy prices for Americans. This shouldn't come as a surprise \u2014 in his first term, upon taking office, he overturned 100 environmental rules enacted by President Obama.",
      "During his presidential campaign, Trump promised business-friendly policies that he claimed would halve energy costs in a year by approving new drilling and slashing red tape.",
      "Some experts doubt that'll happen.",
      "\"There is no universe in which decisions by the federal government can cause that extent of a reaction from markets,\" Jonathan Elkind, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University told CBS News. \"The oil markets, they are too big, they are too global, and the president of the United States does not have the capability to exert influence that is as strong as that.\"",
      "There are still, however, some Biden climate policies that are likely to be out of Trump's reach.",
      "Billions in clean energy investment was set aside in the 2022 climate law, the most significant climate change legislation ever signed. But the key to protecting that funding is making sure the money is spent, or allocated, before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.",
      "Once the grant money is spent, Trump and Republicans are highly unlikely to be able to claw it back.",
      "\"Legally, any obligated fund is safe,\" said Christina DeConcini, director of government affairs at World Resources Institute. \"If you listen to incoming administration officials, they are saying that they're going to go after that. I don't think they're going to have a legal leg to stand on if it's been obligated.\"",
      "The EPA says it's learned over the years that the surest way to protect climate policy is to tie a regulation directly to legislation and funding.",
      "In total, about $643.1 billion, or over 93% of funding available, has been obligated, according to a White House official. Billions remain to be spent under the climate law in the next fiscal year, and some Republicans may want to keep the climate spending in their districts and states.",
      "Trying to take the grant funding back would mean \"potentially taking away benefits to communities, both in terms of public health protections, but also economic benefits,\" EPA senior adviser for implementation Zealan Hoover told CBS News.",
      "And these grants are also far from the most expensive line-items in the climate law. The Energy Department announced almost $18 million for projects that bolster recycling programs, launch residential energy efficiency rebate programs and expand bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, among other projects. The Agriculture Department put $256 million toward the Rural Energy Program for America to expand use of wind, solar, geothermal and small hydropower energy.",

    "story": [
      "In a move that has stunned Washington, President-elect Donald Trump is now urging Congress to eliminate the debt ceiling, dramatically shaking up talks among lawmakers, who are at an impasse over federal spending and on government funding, which is scheduled to lapse this weekend.",
      "While some on Capitol Hill have balked at Trump's latest demand, the president-elect was unwavering on Thursday. He said he is determined to hold his position that lawmakers should both oppose any sweeping spending measure that includes \"traps\" from Democrats and abolish the debt limit before he takes office next year.",
      "\"Number one, the debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely,\" Trump said in a phone interview. \"Number two, a lot of the different things they thought they'd receive [in a recently proposed spending deal] are now going to be thrown out, 100%. And we'll see what happens. We'll see whether or not we have a closure during the Biden administration. But if it's going to take place, it's going to take place during Biden, not during Trump.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which have sent negotiators in both parties back to the drawing board ahead of the expiration of government funding at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, came a day after he\u00a0called\u00a0a bipartisan spending deal \"ridiculous and extraordinarily expensive\" and said that any legislation to extend the federal government's funding should also include plans for \"terminating or extending\" the debt limit.",
      "Still, Trump, who built a decades-long business career as a negotiator and dealmaker, appeared to leave room for House Speaker Mike Johnson and other top Republicans to find consensus on new options that he would find sufficient.",
      "When asked how he would like to see this standoff end, Trump replied, \"It's going to end in a number of ways that would be very good.\"",
      "Trump said the discussions are ongoing and it is too soon for him to spell out more details on what the contours of a final agreement should be.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Trump said. \"It's too early.\"",
      "But Trump said he will continue to closely track how Democrats might seek to influence any revised deal and voiced displeasure at how the initial bipartisan deal had Democratic provisions.",
      "\"We caught them trying to lay traps. And I wasn't going to stand for it,\" he said. \"There are not going to be any traps by the radical left, crazy Democrats.\"",
      "In a post on his Truth Social app early Friday, Trump doubled down, saying, \"\"Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling. Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is President.\"",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a billionaire who spent almost $300 million to back Trump and other Republican candidates in the November elections, also opposed the initial bipartisan spending deal, which he called \"terrible.\" When Johnson scrapped it, Musk wrote on X, \"The voice of the people has triumphed!\"",
      "Trump's focus on the debt ceiling, which caps the federal government's borrowing authority, comes as he faces a showdown over the issue during the first year of his upcoming term. That prospect, several people close to Trump say, has drawn his attention because he wants to spend his time and political capital next year on other issues and would prefer Congress address it now.",
      "While the current cap on federal borrowing is suspended until Jan. 1, 2025, the Treasury Department would be able to take steps to avoid default for a few months into next year. Nevertheless, the government could face an economically fraught default sometime early next year should the debt ceiling not be extended or addressed by Congress.",
      "When asked Thursday about Trump's call to address the debt limit, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic leader, said, \"The debt-limit issue and discussion is premature at best.\"",

    "summary": "Hostage envoy Roger Carstens is in Syria making the first known in-person U.S. in-person contact with the caretaker government and seeking help in finding missing American Austin Tice.",
    "story": [
      "Roger Carstens, the Biden administration's top official for freeing Americans held overseas, on Friday arrived in Damascus, Syria, for a high-risk mission: making the first known face-to-face contact with the caretaker government and asking for help finding missing American journalist Austin Tice.",
      "Tice was kidnapped in Syria 12 years ago during the civil war and brutal reign of now-deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. For years, U.S. officials have said they do not know with certainty whether Tice is still alive, where he is being held or by whom.",
      "The State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, accompanied Carstens to Damascus as a gesture of broader outreach to Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, the rebel group that recently overthrew Assad's regime and is emerging as a leading power.",
      "Near East Senior Adviser Daniel Rubinstein was also with the delegation. They are the first American diplomats to visit Damascus in over a decade, according to a State Department spokesperson.",
      "They plan to meet with HTS representatives to discuss transition principles endorsed by the U.S. and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan, the spokesperson said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Aqaba last week to meet with Middle East leaders and discuss the situation in Syria.",
      "While finding and freeing Tice and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime is the ultimate goal, U.S. officials are downplaying expectations of a breakthrough on this trip. Multiple sources told CBS News that Carstens and Leaf's intent is to convey U.S. interests to senior HTS leaders, and learn anything they can about Tice.",
      "Rubinstein will lead the U.S. diplomacy in Syria, engaging directly with the Syrian people and key parties in Syria, the State Department spokesperson added.",
      "Diplomatic outreach to HTS comes in a volatile, war-torn region at an uncertain moment. Two sources even compared the potential danger to the expeditionary diplomacy practiced by the late U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who led outreach to rebels in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and was killed in a terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound and intelligence post.",
      "U.S. special operations forces known as JSOC provided security for the delegation as they traveled by vehicle across the Jordanian border and on the road to Damascus. The convoy was given assurances by HTS that it would be granted safe passage while in Syria, but there remains a threat of attacks by other terrorist groups, including ISIS.",
      "CBS News withheld publication of this story for security concerns at the State Department's request.",
      "Sending high-level American diplomats to Damascus represents a significant step in reopening U.S.-Syria relations following the fall of the Assad regime less than two weeks ago. Operations at the U.S. embassy in Damascus have been suspended since 2012, shortly after the Assad regime brutally repressed an uprising that became a 14-year civil war and spawned 13 million Syrians to flee the country in one of the largest humanitarian disasters in the world.",
      "The U.S. formally designated HTS, which had ties to al Qaeda, as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. Its leader, Mohammed al Jolani, was designated as a terrorist by the US in 2013 and prior to that served time in a US prison in Iraq.",
      "Since toppling Assad, HTS has publicly signaled interest in a new more moderate trajectory. Al Jolani even shed his nom de guerre and now uses his legal name, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "U.S. sanctions on HTS linked to those terrorist designations complicate outreach somewhat, but they haven't prevented American officials from making direct contact with HTS at the direction of President Biden. Blinken recently confirmed that U.S. officials were in touch with HTS representatives prior to Carstens and Leaf's visit.",
      "\"We've heard positive statements coming from Mr. Jolani, the leader of HTS,\" Blinken told Bloomberg News on Thursday. \"But what everyone is focused on is what's actually happening on the ground, what are they doing? Are they working to build a transition in Syria that brings everyone in?\"",
      "In that same interview, Blinken also seemed to dangle the possibility that the U.S. could help lift sanctions on HTS and its leader imposed by the United Nations, if HTS builds what he called an inclusive nonsectarian government and eventually holds elections. The Biden administration is not expected to lift the U.S.\u00a0 terrorist designation before the end of the president's\u00a0 term on January 20th.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder disclosed Thursday that the U.S. currently has approximately 2,000 US troops inside of Syria as part of the mission to defeat ISIS, a far higher number than the 900 troops the Biden administration had previously acknowledged. There are at least five U.S. military bases in the north and south of the country.",
      "The Biden administration is concerned that thousands of ISIS prisoners held at a camp known as al-Hol could be freed. It is currently guarded by the Syrian Democratic forces, Kurdish allies of the U.S. who are wary of the newly-powerful HTS. The situation on the ground is rapidly changing since Russia and Iran withdrew military support from the Assad regime, which has reset the balance of power. Turkey, which has been a sometimes problematic U.S. ally, has been a conduit to HTS and is emerging as a power broker.",
      "A high-risk mission like this is unusual for the typically risk averse Biden administration, which has exercised consistently restrained diplomacy. Blinken approved Carstens and Leaf's trip and relevant congressional leaders were briefed on it days ago.",
      "\"I think it's important to have direct communication, it's important to speak as clearly as possible, to listen, to make sure that we understand as best we can where they're going and where they want to go,\" Blinken said Thursday.",

      "When that investigation came out, Cuomo denied ever sexually harassing women. \"The facts are much different than what has been portrayed,\" Cuomo said at the time. \"I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.\"",
      "Last week, Bennett dropped a separate federal suit she had filed in 2022 accusing Cuomo of sexual harassment. In a statement posted by her attorney on X, Bennett cited \"invasive discovery requests\" made by Cuomo's legal team that included her medical records from more than a decade ago.",

Trump called on Republicans to reject the bill offered by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson because the 1,500-page spending bill does far more than simply extending government funding. It also includes disaster aid, health care policy extenders and a pay raise for members of Congress, among other provisions.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 14:04:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Georgia Court of Appeals ruled that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis must be removed from the 2020 election case against President-elect Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday ruled that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis must be removed from the 2020 election case against President-elect Donald Trump, reversing a trial judge's decision that allowed her to remain on the case.",
      "Trump and more than a dozen allies were charged last year by Fulton County prosecutors related to what they said was an alleged scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. The president-elect pleaded not guilty.",
      "\"After carefully considering the trial court's findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office,\" the court's majority found. \"The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring..\"",
      "The court, which divided 2-1, said that in this case, \"disqualification is mandated and no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings.\" But it did not dismiss the indictment, leaving it in place. The prosecution will likely be referred to a body known as the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council for reassignment.",
      "Judge Trenton Brown wrote for the majority that \"while this is the rare case\" in which Willis and her office must be removed because of a \"significant appearance of impropriety,\" the record in the case doesn't support the \"imposition of the extreme sanction\" of tossing out the indictment.",
      "Steven Cheung, spokesman for the president-elect, said in a statement that \"in granting President Trump an overwhelming mandate, the American People have demanded an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts against him. We look forward to uniting our country as President Trump Makes America Great Again.\"",
      "Steve Sadow, Trump's lawyer, praised the decision as \"well-reasoned and just.\"",
      "\"The court highlighted that Willis' misconduct created an 'odor of mendacity' and an appearance of impropriety that could only be cured by the disqualification of her and her entire office. As the Court rightfully noted, only the remedy of disqualification will suffice to restore public confidence,\" he said in a statement. \"This decision puts an end to a politically motivated persecution of the next president of the United States.\"",
      "Willis' office notified the court of appeals that they intend to ask the Georgia Supreme Court to review its\u00a0decision.",
      "In March, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis from the case over a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor in November 2021 to assist in the investigation into Trump and his allies. McAfee had ruled that Willis and the Fulton County District Attorney's Office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he did.",
      "Trump and eight co-defendants\u00a0appealed McAfee's ruling. The Georgia Court of Appeals was set to hold a hearing earlier this month, but canceled the proceedings after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency in November. He is set to be sworn in for a second term Jan. 20.",
      "Raised by Michael Roman, a longtime GOP operative charged alongside Trump, the bombshell revelation of Willis and Wade's relationship roiled the prosecution and derailed proceedings in the case for months. McAfee held a multi-day evidentiary hearing examining whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case through her relationship with Wade and travels with him.",
      "Roman had claimed the two started dating before Wade was hired to work on the investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia, and alleged that Willis financially benefited from the relationship. Trump and seven others joined Roman's effort to remove Willis and her office from the case and have the charges against them dismissed.",
      "Willis and Wade admitted they were romantically involved but denied any wrongdoing. They testified that the relationship began after Wade was hired, and that it ended last summer.",
      "While McAfee's decision was a win for Willis, it lambasted her for what the judge said was a \"tremendous lapse in judgment.\" He criticized the \"unprofessional manner\" of her\u00a0testimony during the evidentiary hearing\u00a0earlier this year, when Wade and Willis separately answered questions from prosecutors and defense attorneys about their relationship.",
      "The judge said that while he was not able to \"conclusively establish\" when Wade and Willis' relationship turned romantic, \"an odor of mendacity remains.\"",
      "Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for Roman, said they are \"pleased\" the appeals court agreed with them that Willis shouldn't have been allowed to prosecute the case.",
      "\"We regret that Ms. Willis did not do the right thing and voluntarily recuse herself when Mr. Roman raised the issue because failing to do so put Judge McAfee in an untenable position,\" she said in a statement. \"This failure of judgment is the exact reason Mr. Roman was forced to move to disqualify her in the first place, so we are thankful that the court agreed she should not be allowed to prosecute this case any further.\"",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County was one of four pursued against Trump. He faced charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith in federal courts in Washington, D.C., and South Florida, and was charged with violating New York law by the Manhattan district attorney.",
      "The Fulton County case had moved the slowest, in part because of the allegations against Willis and Wade. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts, but five of them were dismissed by McAfee\u00a0for various reasons. Of the 18 original co-defendants, four\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0after reaching plea deals with prosecutors.",
      "In New York, Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records and was set to be sentenced last month. That sentencing, however, was postponed following his election.",
      "The two federal prosecutions, meanwhile, came to a close last month after Smith sought to dismiss the charges. A longstanding Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president, and the special counsel said that applied to Trump's situation.",
      "The first case stemmed from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after he left office in January 2021. The second arose from what Smith claimed was an unlawful scheme to subvert the peaceful transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election.",
      "Trump had denied wrongdoing in all of the cases, claiming they were brought by politically motivated prosecutors who sought to harm his campaign for the White House.",
      "Jared Eggleston, \n                                                  \n                                  Graham Kates and \n                                                  \n                                  Daniel Klaidman\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "\"My phone was ringing off the hook,\" Republican Rep. Andy Barr said. \"The people who elected us are listening to Elon Musk.\"",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump delivered a likely death blow to\u00a0bipartisan congressional budget negotiations, rejecting the measure as full of giveaways to Democrats after billionaire ally Elon Musk whipped up outrage toward the bill and cheered on Republican lawmakers who announced their opposition.",
      "Trump's joint statement Wednesday with Vice President-elect JD Vance stopped the bill in its tracks and punctuated a torrent of social media posts by Musk attacking the legislation for what he described as excessive spending.",
      "\"Stop the steal of your tax dollars!\" Musk wrote on his social media platform X as he dangled primary challenges against anyone who voted for the budget deal, a threat Trump later echoed in a post of his own.",
      "The episode showcased the growing political influence of Musk, a huge campaign donor\u00a0and promoter of Trump-friendly messaging on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he bought in 2022. Trump has selected Musk alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental task force formed to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and reduce regulations.",
      "Rep. Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky, said his office was flooded with calls from constituents.",
      "\"My phone was ringing off the hook,\" he said. \"The people who elected us are listening to Elon Musk.\"",
      "In addition to keeping the government funded through March, the legislation included $110.4 billion in disaster aid, including $29 billion for FEMA's disaster relief fund, which has been depleted in the aftermath of hurricanes Milton and Helene. The 1,500-page bill also included funding to rebuild Baltimore's collapsed Key Bridge, a variety of health care provisions, and a congressional pay raise.",
      "In his statement with Vance, Trump said Republicans should restart negotiations over the legislation, arguing that \"anything else is a betrayal of our country.\" He also called for including an extension of the debt ceiling while President Biden is in office.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" they said. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on a debt ceiling increase now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate over the debt ceiling now.\"",
      "Then, in an interview with CBS News on Thursday, Trump said he thinks \"the debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely.\"",
      "Trump's opposition to what was considered must-pass legislation reinjected a sense of uncertainty and political brinkmanship that was reminiscent of his first term in office. It was a dramatic turn of events for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who negotiated the bill and has been undermined by Trump as he faces reelection for his post in just a couple of weeks. Republicans have a slim majority, raising the possibility of a replay of leadership disputes that paralyzed the House a year ago.",
      "Many lawmakers were in the middle of holiday and year-end celebrations with staff when Trump came out against the legislation.",
      "\"I've been here 14 years, OK? So nothing up here surprises me anymore,\" said Rep. Steve Womack, a senior Republican appropriator from Arkansas. \"We shouldn't be in this mess.\"",
      "The Biden administration criticized the possibility of a shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.",
      "Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a veteran of Washington's budget battles, was concerned about the lack of a clear plan for resolving the dispute.",
      "\"There's got to be a second part of the strategy,\" he said.",
      "Norquist has been enthusiastic about Musk's ability to generate public attention for efforts to reduce the size of government. But he suggested that the owner of a space rocket company wasn't the right person to spearhead a congressional spending debate.",
      "\"He doesn't know politics like he knows physics,\" he said.",
      "But others were thrilled with Musk's involvement.",
      "\"In five years in Congress, I've been awaiting a fundamental change in the dynamic,\" posted Rep. Dan Bishop, a Republican from North Carolina. \"It has arrived.\"",
      "Musk began criticizing the measure as soon as it was released Tuesday evening, and he continuously posted about it Wednesday.",
      "\"Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!\" he wrote. He also called it \"one of the worst bills ever written.\"",
      "Sometimes Musk amplified false claims, such as the idea that the legislation included $3 billion for a new football stadium in Washington. In reality, the legislation would transfer ownership of the land from the federal government to the city, paving the way for eventual development.",
      "That followed a pattern seen in CBS News analysis of his posts during the campaign season, when Musk frequently shared false narratives about the election and amplified extreme voices from the right-wing fringe to his millions of followers.",
      "Musk appeared emboldened by the experience combatting the funding bill.",
      "\"The voice of the people was heard,\" Musk wrote. \"This was a good day for America.\"",
      "Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries said the fallout would be Republicans' fault.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:20:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats elect a new party chair on Feb. 1, following the loss of the presidency and the Senate and the narrow failure to win the House in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Martin O'Malley has the kind of experience that would typically benefit a Democrat who wants to guide the party's future after devastating losses in the last election.",
      "He's a former governor, former mayor and a 2016 presidential candidate who until recently was serving in President Biden's administration. Yet O'Malley is facing a difficult path in the race to try and become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee as the party reckons with the reality that key pockets of voters turned against it.",
      "Vital to O'Malley's attempt is a campaign platform, first reported by CBS News, that calls for reconnecting the Democratic Party \"to the kitchen table of every American family.\"",
      "\"We suffered a very bad loss,\" O'Malley said in an interview, urging Democrats \"to learn from it in order to win the next battles ahead.\"",
      "His vision is centered on a 57-state and territory strategy along with plans to give campaigns \"world-class AI tools for voter outreach, research, communications, and financial management, eliminating barriers to effective campaigning.\" O'Malley's pitch is also focused on \"re-investing in direct voter registration,\" as part of his pledge for the party to make \"voter protection and registration the pillars of the change we need to win.\"",
      "Democrats weathered a chaotic election cycle in 2024, punctuated by the push within the party to convince Mr. Biden to end his reelection run after a dismal debate performance in June. While Mr. Biden eventually ended his bid in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, the 107-day sprint that followed resulted in Democrats losing the White House and Senate while failing, albeit narrowly, to win control of the House.",
      "Now the party is essentially leaderless and preparing for an emboldened Donald Trump to return to Washington, where he'll be able to benefit from Republicans' unified control of Congress and the White House. Those dynamics will be well in play at the time of the election for DNC chair on Feb. 1 given the unease among Democrats that has been abundantly clear in the weeks following the presidential election.",
      "\"I want to see someone who doesn't come from the Washington circuit, who actually has been out there in the tissue of the country,\" Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a battleground district Democrat, said of the DNC chair race.",
      "Failure can mean opportunity. The party's struggles means O'Malley, as well as other ambitious Democrats, have a chance to become the next chair and carry wide ranging influence during a critical time for the party as it looks to regain ground in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. For all his apparent vulnerabilities, Trump was far more successful in this election than ever before, winning all seven presidential battlegrounds. Whether what happened in 2024 will become a tangible turning point for Democrats is likely to loom over the chair race in the coming weeks.",
      "\"That's the big shift that's happened with this election going the wrong way on us,\" O'Malley said. \"We're now in a mode of needing a changemaker, not a caretaker.\"",
      "Among those running for chair, Ken Martin, the leader of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic Party and a DNC vice chair, as well as Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, are seen as frontrunners. Martin has deep relationships within the DNC and can boast a statewide winning streak for candidates in Minnesota, while Wikler carries the political gravitas of helping lead the party in one of the nation's seven presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Earlier this month, Martin announced a framework which includes his drive for a \"Democratic infrastructure in all 3,244 counties,\" across the country, as well as taking on the branding problem evident from the 2024 election results.",
      "\"The majority of Americans now believe the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and the elites,\" Martin said in his framework. \"It's a damning indictment on our party brand. We must be willing to dig deep and recenter the Democratic agenda to unite families across race, age, background, and class.\"",
      "During a brief pitch to party leaders at a meeting in Washington D.C. last week where Martin and O'Malley also spoke, Wikler told his fellow Democrats \"we need to build the battle plan to change how we communicate, so we show what we mean when we say we fight for working folks.\"",
      "This isn't the first time O'Malley has been linked to leading the party. Days after the 2016 election, he posted on social media that despite encouragement, he would not run for chair. Eight years later, he's navigating a short window to make his case as he emphasizes his lengthy career in politics.",
      "Both Martin and Wikler were deeply involved in the 2024 cycle, and voting to lead the DNC will take place a little under three months removed from Election Day. That dynamic is among the challenges O'Malley faces as he tries to quickly build support among the DNC's relatively small base of voting members. While O'Malley can tout his experience in elected office, both Martin and Wikler are able to point to their work helping lead their respective state parties in 2020 and the crucial elections that happened over the last four years.",
      "But if Democrats are eager to distance themselves broadly from what played out in the last election, O'Malley may be able to capitalize in an attempt to be seen as more of an outsider than his main competitors. And around a month after his bid began, O'Malley's campaign is adamant that he is making a compelling case that is resonating.",
      "\"As it stands today, we know Gov. O'Malley has earned the endorsement of nearly four dozen DNC Members,\" a campaign spokesman said, adding that ahead of the Feb. 1 contest \"we have the momentum in this race.\"",
      "O'Malley served as mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007 and went on to win two terms as governor of Maryland, which included a stint leading the Democratic Governors Association. His political power has faded since then however, illustrated most notably by the struggles he faced during his campaign for president in the 2016 Democratic primary. Before announcing his run for chair, O'Malley spent nearly a year working in the federal government as commissioner of Social Security.",
      "That experience is intertwined in O'Malley's platform, which also calls for creating \"a feedback loop for our local and state elected officials to ensure that they can help inform our messaging and tactics.\"",
      "\"We all know we need to restore our credibility,\" O'Malley said. \"We need to learn from our failings, as well as our candidates who succeeded. But only one of us [in the race for DNC chair] has actually proven an ability to effectuate a rapid turnaround like we need to do right now in order to win the next election.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson scrapped a last-minute measure to avoid a government shutdown late Wednesday after facing opposition from fellow Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 who objected to billions of dollars in spending that had been added to the bill.",
      "Lawmakers are facing a Friday deadline to approve new spending. The measure released Tuesday would have extended funding through March 14, but it also included disaster aid, health care policy extenders and a pay raise for members of Congress, among other provisions. The disaster relief portion of the bill alone carried a price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, confirmed that the\u00a0stopgap funding measure\u00a0is dead and that the path forward is unclear.",
      "\"There's no new agreement right now,\" Scalise said on Capitol Hill after a flurry of activity Wednesday evening.",
      "In a statement\u00a0hours earlier, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance criticized Johnson's approach and said Republicans should pass \"a streamlined spending bill that doesn't give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want.\" They also called for House Republicans to increase the debt ceiling, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills.",
      "\"Republicans want to support our farmers, pay for disaster relief, and set our country up for success in 2025. The only way to do that is with a temporary funding bill WITHOUT DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS combined with an increase in the debt ceiling,\" they said. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country.\"",
      "The debt ceiling has not been a part of these negotiations, and Republicans typically oppose increasing it. Trump's decision to inject the issue into shutdown talks added a new dimension to the legislative fight with just two days to go before funding lapses.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" Trump and Vance wrote. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate now.\" Under legislation passed in June 2023, the debt ceiling was suspended until the first quarter of 2025.",
      "Republicans turned against the funding plan after a barrage of social media posts by Trump ally Elon Musk lambasting it throughout the day Wednesday.",
      "At the U.S. Capitol, Vance did not answer when asked if he and Trump supported a shutdown.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget told federal agencies to start communicating with employees about shutdown procedures starting at 10am tomorrow, sources familiar told CBS News late Wednesday.",
      "Last Friday, the agencies were told to have their shutdown preparations in order and ready to go.",
      "The continuing resolution",
      "When it was unveiled on Tuesday, the spending legislation immediately sparked anger from multiple members of the House Republican conference, mostly targeted at Johnson. While the speaker had pledged to avoid the kind of massive, end-of-year spending bills that conservatives loathe, the final product resembled a scaled-down version of what the party's right flank has railed against for years now.",
      "But the Republicans' slim majority in the House means Johnson would have needed Democratic votes to pass the bill, a dynamic that gave the minority more leverage to extract concessions during negotiations. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hinted at Democrats' influence amid reports that Johnson could scale back the bill, writing in a post on X: \"You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow.\"",
      "\"Republicans have now unilaterally decided to break a bipartisan agreement that they made,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, told reporters Wednesday night. \"House Republicans will now own any harm that is visited upon the American people that results from a government shutdown or worse. An agreement is an agreement. It was bipartisan. And there is nothing more to say.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also called on Republicans to \"keep their word.\"",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" she said in statement.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, acknowledged that the bill was intended to be \"very skinny\" before a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation left by hurricanes earlier this year.",
      "Before the text of the bill was released, Johnson dismissed Republican concerns that the continuing resolution was equivalent to an \"omnibus\" bill, a term used when Congress packages the annual appropriations bills that fund many federal government agencies into one large piece of legislation.",
      "\"This is not an omnibus, OK?\" Johnson said at his weekly news conference on Tuesday. \"This is a small [continuing resolution] that we had to add things to that were out of our control. These are not man-made disasters. These are things that the federal government has an appropriate role to do.\"",
      "Johnson had also vowed to give members 72 hours to read the bill before a vote, but lawmakers said they were expecting a vote as soon as Wednesday, which would give them less than 24 hours to get through the nearly 1,550-page text. The path forward was cast into doubt by Trump's statement, with speculation growing that Johnson would scrap the original version of the bill and bring up a narrower funding extension that includes disaster relief.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, on Tuesday called the process \"a total dumpster fire.\" He said he was \"disappointed\" in Johnson and called on him to \"communicate better.\" Other members, like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, have dubbed the bill the \"Cramnibus.\" Rep. Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican, said the measure was \"a band-aid that is laced with fentanyl.\"",
      "\"There's a certain sandwich that's made of feces, and that's what I would compare this to,\" said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, also of Florida.

      "In the final days of his administration, President Biden has set a new climate goal for slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. However, it comes as his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, has signaled he is not interested in global climate negotiations.",
      "The U.S. formally submitted its new goal Thursday to the United Nations. It calls for a 61% to 66% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels, the White House said, with an overarching goal of achieving net zero emissions by no later than 2050.",
      "The new goal is part of the Paris Agreement, under which member nations must update their emission cut targets \u2014 known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs \u2014 every five years.",
      "The Paris accord requires countries to set voluntary targets for reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The only binding requirement is that nations accurately report on their efforts. First signed in 2016 by nearly 200 nations, it seeks to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.",
      "The new climate commitment \"marks an ambitious capstone to President Biden's climate legacy,\" the White House said in a news release, adding that it will help grow a new clean energy economy focused on investment, innovation, and jobs.",
      "\"The United States' new climate commitment offers a clear path forward for states, cities, businesses, and other leaders dedicated to ramping up action over the next four years,\" said Debbie Weyl, U.S. acting director for the nonprofit environmental group the World Resource Institute, in a statement. \"Even though the Trump administration may not lift a finger to deliver on this plan, it sets a north star for what the U.S. should be aiming for and could help guide the federal government's priorities once Trump leaves office in 2029,\" Weyl said.",
      "In 2017, then-President Trump announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, a process which took until nearly the end of his first term to complete. However, Mr. Biden fulfilled a campaign vow by rejoining the Paris Agreement on the first day of his own administration in early 2021.",

Hernandez, a teacher who fled his home country in the 1990s, was granted legal status and a work permit under the Temporary Protection Status program.",
      "The program, created by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, allows immigrants to temporarily remain in the U.S. if they're from countries designated as unsafe. TPS allows migrants to apply for work permits and shields them from deportation, but does not offer a pathway to citizenship.",
      "Now, Hernandez is joining other TPS holders across the country in a hunger strike to pressure Mr. Biden to extend protected status for immigrants at risk for deportation, since President-elect Donald Trump has promised to revoke the program upon taking office.",

He will deliver.\" Leavitt said. But she did not address what the Trump administration plans to do with migrants who have temporary legal U.S. status.",

      "Approximately 300,000 TPS holders reside in Florida, while Texas has nearly 95,000, and New York and California each have around 68,000.",
      "TPS holders are provided renewable relief for up to six, 12 or 18 months, but without an extension, many will begin losing their legal status in 2025. Protections for Salvadorans are set to expire first in March, with Venezuela, Ukraine and Sudan in April, and Nicraragua in July.",
      "\"It is very important that anybody who is under Temporary Protection Status sits down with an attorney to evaluate every possible avenue to obtain a permanent status, or to change status, and figure it out,\" said Haim Vasquez, an immigration lawyer in Dallas, Texas. \"If there's anything that can be done, they must do it sooner than later.\"",

      "Extensions, known as designations, for TPS are announced two months before the expiration date, Vasquez said. In this case, Biden would have to issue a new designation for Salvadorans by Jan. 9.",
      "As for how much time immigrants would have in the country before they face deportation if Trump were to fulfill his promises and revoke TPS, Vasquez says it depends on how Trump terminates the program. He could allow the status to run through expiration dates previously set; any revocation is sure to be met with lawsuits.",
      "\"A hundred percent, we expect that there will be legal challenges,\" Vasquez said.",
      "During his first administration, Trump tried to terminate TPS for beneficiaries from six countries, including Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan. Trump's attempts, however, were immediately met with legal challenges, and a judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the TPS terminations.",

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that while the NDAA \"isn't perfect,\" it still \"includes some very good things that Democrats fought for\" \u2014 citing provisions aimed at standing up against the Chinese Communist Party, boosting the use of artificial intelligence for national defense and expanding domestic tech innovation.",
      "\"Congress has passed the NDAA on a bipartisan basis for over six straight decades, and this year will be no different,\" Schumer said ahead of the vote on Wednesday. \"We're passing the NDAA and that's a very good thing.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to consider the South Carolina health department's effort to cut off funding from Planned Parenthood because it performs abortions, wading into another dispute over access to the procedure in the wake of its reversal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The case, known as Kerr v. Edwards, stems from the state's decision in 2018 to end Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's participation in its Medicaid program. Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, directed the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to deem abortion clinics unqualified to provide family planning services and end their Medicaid agreements.",
      "Planned Parenthood operates two facilities in the state, one in Charleston and the other in Columbia, and provides hundreds of Medicaid patients with services like physicals, cancer and other health screenings, pregnancy testing and contraception. Federal law prohibits Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.",
      "Planned Parenthood and one of its patients, Julie Edwards, sued the state, arguing that cutting off its funding violated a provision of the Medicaid Act that gives beneficiaries the right to choose their provider.",
      "A federal district court blocked South Carolina from ending Planned Parenthood's participation in its Medicaid program, and a U.S. appeals court upheld that decision, finding that Edwards could sue the state to enforce the Medicaid Act's free-choice-of-provider requirement.",
      "The legal battle has already been before the Supreme Court in the past, with the high court last year ordering additional proceedings after deciding in a separate case that nursing home residents could sue their state-owned health care facility over alleged violations of civil rights.",
      "After reconsidering its earlier decision, the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously in March that Edwards' lawsuit against the state could go forward and said South Carolina couldn't strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funds.",
      "\"This case is, and always has been, about whether Congress conferred an individually enforceable right for Medicaid beneficiaries to freely choose their healthcare provider. Preserving access to Planned Parenthood and other providers means preserving an affordable choice and quality care for an untold number of mothers and infants in South Carolina,\" Judge Harvie Wilkinson wrote for the panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.",
      "South Carolina officials asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, marking the third time the case has been before the justices. The justices agreed to take up the question of whether \"the Medicaid Act's any-qualified provider provision unambiguously confers a private right upon a Medicaid beneficiary to choose a specific provider.\"",

    "story": [
      "Humans aren't alone when it comes to yawning\u00a0\u2014 all vertebrates do it too, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. But why?",
      "The \"evolutionarily ancient\" act of yawning likely serves a few purposes, according to Andrew Gallup, a professor of behavioral biology at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\"The fact that it is conserved so widely across the animal kingdom suggests that it likely holds an evolutionary function, and research suggests that it functions in a variety of domains,\" he said on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0Friday.",
      "Those findings suggest yawning may have a role in promoting changes in our state of alertness or activity patterns.",
      "\"We often yawn frequently before we go to sleep or after we wake up,\" Gallup said. \"Yawns have been shown to increase arousal and alertness as associated with these state changes.\"",
      "Research also suggests yawning has a brain-cooling function.",
      "\"One of the mechanisms that could facilitate changes in state or heightened arousal as a result of yawning is brain cooling,\" Gallup said.",
      "Brain cooling refers to cooling the temperature of the brain, he said, and this can help us feel calmer, \"because stress and anxiety increase brain temperature and also trigger yawning.\"",
      "Gallup also said he isn't insulted when someone yawns, because it's both contagious and a common, natural mechanism.",
      "\"It helps promote mental awareness and alertness. So when individuals yawn in an academic setting or a boardroom, it could be an indicator that they're actually trying to pay attention,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:18:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

    "summary": "Giant hornets, dubbed \"murder hornets,\" have been eradicated in the U.S., five years after the invasive species was first detected in Washington state.",
    "story": [
      "The Northern giant hornet, more commonly known as the \"murder hornet,\" has been eradicated in the U.S., agriculture officials said Wednesday.",
      "The ominously nicknamed invasive species was confirmed to be in the U.S. in 2019 after officials in Washington state received and verified two reports of the hornet. Efforts quickly began to track and get rid of them.",
      "The 2-inch-long hornet, with a stinger longer than that of a typical wasp, can deliver potent venom, but is largely dangerous to bees and other insects, not humans. Eradication efforts started because of the threat the hornet posed to bees and agriculture across the country.",
      "\"By tackling this threat head-on, we protected not only pollinators and crops, but also the industries, communities, and ecosystems that depend on them,\" Dr. Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in a news statement.",
      "How \"murder hornets\" were eradicated",
      "State, federal and international government agencies worked together to eradicate \"murder hornets\" in the U.S., the officials said.",
      "To do so, first entomologists had to find the hornets' nests.\u00a0Finding the nests can be a challenge, because the hornets typically build their nests in forested areas, often in an underground cavity, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In some cases, entomologists captured a live hornet, attached a radio tag to it, released it, and tracked the hornet back to its nest. Figuring out how to securely attach a radio tag to a hornet without harming it was a hurdle.",
      "After finding a nest in a tree, a team plugged the nest with foam, wrapped the tree in plastic and vacuumed out the hornets. They also injected carbon dioxide into the tree to kill any remaining hornets.",
      "In 2022, scientists said they were setting about 1,000 hornet traps in Washington. Hornets caught in traps help scientists find the location of nests. The previous year, Washington state officials destroyed a nest, finding nearly 1,500 hornets \"in various stages of development.\"",
      "The public also helped officials track down hornet nests. If not for help from the public, there's a good chance that the hornet could have been around for years to come, Sven Spichiger, Washington State Department of Agriculture pest program manager, said during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"All of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports,\" Spichiger said in a press release. \"And half of our confirmed detections came from the public.",
      "Could the hornet come back to the U.S.?",
      "While officials in Washington celebrated the eradication of the invasive hornet species, Spichiger acknowledged they could come back to the U.S. He said officials would continue to keep an eye out for the hornet and encouraged members of the community to do the same.",
      "\"They got here once and they could do it again,\" Spichiger said.",
      "CBS News previously reported that it was unclear how the hornets first arrived in the U.S., though invasive species can be \"unwitting hitchhikers\" on things like shipping containers.",
      "Even now, five years after the hornets appeared in the U.S., Spichiger said officials will never know exactly how they got to the country.",
      "What makes \"murder hornets\" unique?",
      "The hornet, an invasive species from Asia, can kill an entire hive of honeybees in as little as 90 minutes, according to agriculture officials.",
      "\"The hornets can enter a 'slaughter phase' where they kill entire hives by decapitating the bees. The hornets then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,\" according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. \"They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire colonies of those insects.\"",
      "The hornets typically only attack people or pets when threatened, but can sting repeatedly.",
      "The hornet species has a large orange or yellow head and black-and-orange stripes across its body.",
      "They were first detected in North America in British Columbia, Canada ,in August 2019, authorities said, and then were confirmed in Washington state by the end of 2019.",
      "When the species first arrived in the U.S., it was known as the Asian giant hornet. But in July of 2022, the Entomological Society of America adopted \"Northern giant hornet\" as the common name for the species. The organization also adopted the names Southern giant hornet as the name for a closely related species.",
      "\"Common names are an important tool for entomologists to communicate with the public about insects and insect science,\" organization President Jessica Ware said at the time. \"Northern giant hornet is both scientifically accurate and easy to understand, and it avoids evoking fear or discrimination.\"",
      "While the U.S. appears to have gotten rid of them, at least for now, scientists in Spain last month reported sightings of the hornet species in Europe. They described two sightings of the hornet in the journal Ecology and Evolution.",

    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

    "story": [
      "NASA researchers combined years of data and new imaging techniques to learn more about a \"tipped over\" black hole that is moving in an unexpected way.",
      "The black hole is located in a galaxy called NGC 5084. Researchers have been aware of the galaxy for years, NASA said in a news release.",
      "New analysis techniques developed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California helped researchers see four long plumes of plasma emanating from the galaxy. Most galaxies don't have plumes, and when they do, only one or two are present. The plumes suggested the galaxy might house a supermassive black hole, NASA said. Spotting both pairs, which formed an \"X\" shape, led researchers to focus more on the area.",
      "Using archived data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Telescope based in Chile, researchers found that the galaxy also had a \"small, dusty inner disk\" rotating at the center of the galaxy, again suggesting a black hole there. Even more surprisingly, both the disk and black hole were rotating at a 90-degree angle relative to the rest of the galaxy, meaning both features are essentially \"lying on their sides,\" NASA said.",
      "\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" said research scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff, who will also publish a paper about the discovery, in the news release. \"Putting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"",
      "It's not clear what caused the change in the galaxy. It may have collided with another galaxy and formed a chimney of superheated gas, creating the X-shaped plasma plumes. Further research will have to be conducted to learn more about the circumstances.",

    "story": [
      "Two NASA astronauts who flew up to the International Space Station in a Boeing Starliner capsule for a round trip that was supposed to last just over a week will be stuck in space for closer to a year before they can come home. Despite the astronauts' longer-than-expected stay at the space station, officials have insisted that Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore aren't stranded in space.",
      "Here's what we know about the stuck astronauts:",
      "Why are the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "Williams and Wilmore blasted off to the space station in June. Their mission was supposed to take between eight and 10 days, but helium leaks in the capsule's propulsion system and degraded thrusters, which are important for re-entry, upended plans for bringing the astronauts back to Earth.",
      "\"Eight days to eight months or nine months or 10 months, whatever it is, we're going to do the very best job we can do every single day,\" Wilmore told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann in September. At the time, they were expected to leave the space station in late February 2025.",
      "The capsule safely returned to Earth in September with no one onboard.",
      "Who are the astronauts who are stuck in space?",
      "Williams turned 59 on the space station in September. She joined NASA in 1998 after serving in the Navy for over a decade, retiring as a captain. As a naval aviator, she logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. At NASA, she had set a record for women with four spacewalks lasting a total of 29 hours, 17 minutes, but it was broken by Peggy Whitson with her fifth spacewalk in 2008.",
      "Wilmore also retired from the Navy as a captain, recording over 8,000 flight hours as a naval aviator. During Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991, Wilmore flew 21 combat missions. He joined NASA in 2000 and accumulated 178 days in space before the Starliner mission. Like Williams, he has also performed four spacewalks, totaling 25 hours, 36 minutes.",
      "Why did the Boeing Starliner crew go to the International Space Station in the first place?",
      "The June launch was the Starliner's first piloted test flight. NASA has funded the development of the capsule and SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the space agency looks to stop using Russian Soyuz flights to transport astronauts to and from the space station.",
      "When will the astronauts be able to return to Earth?",
      "On Tuesday, Dec. 17, NASA announced Williams and Wilmore would return to Earth after the agency's new SpaceX crew arrives at the space station.

    "title": "NASA leader weighs in on Elon Musk, SpaceX and plans for moon rocket",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:26:37 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson says he's optimistic the Trump administration will support the space agency's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wednesday he is optimistic SpaceX founder Elon Musk's relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump will help ensure NASA receives the funding needed to support a robust agenda, including returning U.S. astronauts to the moon.",
      "Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman, veteran of two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights to low-Earth orbit, to serve as NASA's next administrator, prompting speculation Musk's connections to both men might give him even more influence over NASA space policy than he currently wields.",
      "\"On the one hand, I am optimistic because of the relationship that Musk has with Trump that NASA will get the funding that it needs because Musk will be advocating,\" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. \"On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.\"",
      "SpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket to carry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.",
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX is \"the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,\" Nelson said. \"And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.\"",
      "At Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander \"based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.\"",
      "NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.",
      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027. In that flight, an SLS will boost astronauts to the moon in an Orion capsule that will dock with SpaceX's lander in lunar orbit. From there, two astronauts will descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole where ice deposits may await discovery.",
      "\"Right now, when you add up all of that, you're talking about a number of years down the road, you're talking about Artemis 3 landing in mid '27 and then the others to follow,\" Nelson said. \"This is fiscal year '25, we're talking at least into fiscal year 3031.",
      "\"So by that time, is there going to be another rocket that's going to supersede (SLS)? I do not know the answer to that. But I know that the SLS and the Artemis program are certainly going to be there for the near future.\"",

      "Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams traveled to the space station aboard the Starliner back in June. Their trip was initially only to last about eight to 10 days, but multiple issues with the Starliner prompted a concerned NASA, out of caution, to leave them behind at the space station and return the capsule to Earth empty in September.",
      "That same month, a SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon capsule with a reduced two-person crew and two empty seats launched to the space station with the intention of returning Wilmore and Williams aboard it in February 2025.",
      "However, NASA said in a news release Tuesday that Wilmore and Williams' replacements, traveling aboard the SpaceX Crew-10, would be launching to the space station \"no earlier than late March 2025,\" meaning that would be the earliest that Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth.",
      "The most recent delay in the Crew-10's launch is to give \"NASA and SpaceX teams time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission.\"",
      "The Crew-9 \u2014 carrying Williams, Wilmore, fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov \u2014 can only leave the space station following a \"handover period\" with the Crew-10.",
      "The handover period \"allows Crew-9 to share any lessons learned with the newly arrived crew and support a better transition for ongoing science and maintenance at the complex.\"",
      "NASA did not speculate on how long that handover might take.",
      "The Starliner, Boeing's answer to the Crew Dragon, has faced major headwinds since it went into development, including a series of technical issues and budget shortfalls.",
      "It finally launched, but after arriving at the space station with its crew, multiple helium leaks were discovered in the Starliner's propulsion system, along with a degraded thrust in five of its maneuvering jets.",
      "A return in late March or April would mean that a trip that was expected to last just over a week for Williams and Wilmore   will have been stretched to at least nine months.",
      "\"Fabrication, assembly, testing, and final integration of a new spacecraft is a painstaking endeavor that requires great attention to detail,\" Steve Stich, manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in a statement Tuesday about the Crew-10. \"We appreciate the hard work by the SpaceX team to expand the Dragon fleet in support of our missions and the flexibility of the station program and expedition crews as we work together to complete the new capsule's readiness for flight.\"",

      "Why is the December full moon called the Cold Moon?",
      "December's full moon is called the Cold Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because of how cold it usually is during December's full moon.",
      "The moon also has several other nicknames, including the Long Night Moon, a name with Mohican origins, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is because December's full moon happens on one of the longest nights of the year.",

    "title": "How TikTok could avoid being banned in the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" James Scobey, chief information security officer at Keeper Security told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 14:50:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what the anticipated record number of holiday travelers should know about how a government shutdown could affect trips.",
    "story": [
      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",
      "Most TSA workers, about 95%, are considered essential, and would therefore remain on the job in the event of a shutdown \u2014 but without pay \u2014 TSA administrator David Pekoske said in a post on X.",
      "Air traffic controllers are also deemed essential employees and would be expected to work while foregoing a paycheck. Employees would be paid after a shutdown were to end.",
      "Here is how a government shutdown will affect air travel for consumers.",
      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",
      "Not for now. Passengers will still be able to travel on flights they have booked, with operations expected to continue as normal at least in the early days of a shutdown. That's because TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential airport staff will remain on the job.",
      "Will TSA screening lines be longer?",
      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another. About a month into the last shutdown, LaGuardia Airport temporarily delayed flights\u00a0because of staffing shortages, including among air traffic controllers.",
      "In the event of a shutdown, the more than 14,000 air traffic controllers in the U.S. would be expected to show up to work without pay.",
      "What would a government shutdown mean for passport processing?",
      "According to the State Department's contingency plan, consular operations will continue as normal \"so long as there are sufficient fees to support operation,\" given that they are integral to national security. That includes passport and visa services.",
      "Still, some passport services could be limited, if they are located in buildings run by another agency that is inoperational.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 14:39:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans in the House are working to craft a plan to avert a government shutdown just hours before funding for agencies is set to lapse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned Friday that his agency could suffer \"serious\" consequences if Congress fails to pass legislation funding federal agencies and averting a government shutdown in the next few hours.",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Mayorkas said many components of the Department of Homeland Security would be affected by a lapse in funding, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), FEMA and Border Patrol.",
      "The homeland security chief added that a failure by lawmakers to pass a stopgap spending bill before Saturday would also mean staff at the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office would be redirected to other parts of his department.",
      "\"The implications and the consequences are serious, especially when it comes to Homeland Security,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "He urged Congress to approve legislation that would keep government agencies operating before midnight, when a short-term extension enacted in September will expire.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled earlier this week a legislative package negotiated with Democrats that would have extended government funding through March 14, provided more than $100 billion in disaster aid for states impacted by extreme weather events, and given members of Congress a pay raise, among other provisions.",
      "But the proposal was swiftly met with pushback from some conservative Republicans, who balked at the size and scope of the 1,550 page deal. Crucially, it was also criticized by billionaire Elon Musk, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, and then by the incoming president himself.",
      "Trump and Musk torpedoed the package, with Musk taking to X, the social media platform he owns, to lambaste provisions of it. The president-elect further upended negotiations over a funding deal when he called on Republicans to address the debt limit \u2014 which is set to be reinstated Jan. 1 \u2014 in their plan.",
      "Johnson unveiled a second measure Thursday, which would have funded the government for three months, suspended the nation's borrowing limit until January 2027 and provided $110 billion in disaster relief. The more tailored legislation, which Trump backed, also included health care provisions, a one-year renewal of the farm bill and funding for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which collapsed in March.",
      "But that package failed to pass the House with the necessary support after it was opposed by most Democrats and more than three dozen Republicans.",
      "That defeat sent Johnson and GOP leaders back to the drawing board, with the prospect of a shutdown rising with each passing hour. Republicans are now discussing voting on three provisions of the package individually, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News: a clean extension of government funding; billions of dollars in disaster aid; and assistance to farmers.",
      "Mayorkas told \"Face the Nation\" that a shutdown just before the holidays \u2014 when tens of millions of Americans are traveling \u2014 would mean TSA employees at airports throughout the country would be forced to work without pay. However, they would likely receive backpay after a shutdown ends, as has happened before after previous funding lapses.",
      "\"We're going to have tens of thousands of TSA employees working an incredibly high volume of passenger traffic throughout our airports across the country, and they will be doing so keeping the American public safe without pay,\" he said.",
      "The Homeland Security secretary also said those impacted would include U.S. Border Patrol agents stationed along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"There are people in government service who are dedicating their talent and their energy to the well-being of the American people, who rely on their paychecks to make ends meet, and it is the holiday season, after all, but our men and women on the border will be guarding the border of the United States at no pay if funding doesn't come through,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "The $110 billion in disaster assistance that will likely be included in a spending deal includes money for FEMA, which has been responding to the hurricanes that devastated the southeast this fall.",
      "Mayorkas said that inaction by Congress would impact those states hit by the storms, including North Carolina and Florida.",
      "\"What FEMA will need to do, another significant impact of the failure to fund the federal government, is they will now need to delay \u2014 they'll put on pause certain contracts, certain projects that are actually repairing communities devastated by extreme weather events, by tornados, by hurricanes, by fires, and that will delay the rebuilding of communities and really delay the ability to deliver for people who have suffered so much,\" he said.",
      "Mayorkas said a shutdown occurring over the holidays would force the Department of Homeland Security to \"make difficult decisions now to delay projects.\"",
      "Lawmakers representing those storm-ravaged states have pushed for disaster relief to be included in any legislative package funding the government.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood powerhouses Tyler Perry and Kerry Washington have joined forces to tell the remarkable story of the 6888th Postal Battalion, which was the only women's Army Corps unit of color to be stationed in Europe during World War II. Perry \u2014 who wrote, directed and produced the film \u2014 describes \"Six Triple Eight\" as an important chapter in U.S. history.",
      "The film centers on the women of the 6888th who were sent to Europe with the daunting task of delivering a backlog of nearly 17 million pieces of mail to U.S. soldiers and their families. The women not only completed the mission, but did so in just 90 days, defying expectations. Kerry Washington stars as Major Charity Adams, the real-life commanding officer of the unit and the highest-ranking Black female officer during the war.",
      "At Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall near Washington, D.C., Perry and Washington discussed the significance of sharing this story.",
      "Washington's portrayal of Adams was a key part of the project. Perry explained his choice of Washington for the role, saying, \"I thought, 'Let's show the world that there's something so different here from you. I know they know Olivia Pope. But when we're done, they're going to see no one but Charity Adams.'\"",

    "summary": "Millions of Medicare enrollees are likely to see relief in 2025 when a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug-spending goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, millions of Americans who get their prescription drugs through Medicare could get a major financial break when a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on medications goes into effect.",
      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",

      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \"continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\" spokesperson Diaz said. \"Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\"",
      "Planning ahead for 2025",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\"Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\" Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \"If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\""

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:56:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Her father John Ramsey said DNA testing on items like a blanket and a rope could point to the killer.",
    "story": [
      "The details of the murder are still shocking today, nearly three decades later. On Dec. 26, 1996, the 6-year-old daughter of John and Patsy Ramsey, a well-to-do couple living in Boulder, Colorado, was found dead in the family's basement. JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, an outgoing child who performed in local beauty pageants, had been bludgeoned and strangled.",
      "It is a story I began covering for \"48 Hours\" in 1999 and will return to in \"The Search for JonBen\u00e9t's Killer\" airing Saturday, Dec. 21 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. The program is a look back at how we covered the case in 2002. It's a television time capsule, allowing viewers to hear Patsy and John Ramsey talk about their daughter and how her death and the following investigation upended their lives.",
      "Shortly before 6 a.m. on the morning after Christmas, Patsy Ramsey called 911. She had awakened, she later told police, to find her daughter missing and a two-and-a-half-page note left on the stairs demanding a $118,000 ransom.",
      "Despite a written warning not to notify anyone, the Ramseys called Boulder police, who searched their home and recommended the family wait for a call from the kidnappers. Later that day, a Boulder detective suggested John Ramsey and a family friend look through the home to see if anything looked out of place. When John Ramsey entered a room in the basement, he found his daughter dead on the floor, with a white blanket over her body and duct tape across her mouth.",
      "The tragic discovery of the child by her own father, after officers had already searched the home, was the beginning of a yearslong, error-plagued investigation. JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey's murder was the first homicide that year in Boulder.",
      "The case, after the acquittal of football star O.J. Simpson, immediately became the next international media sensation. Pictures of the photogenic 6-year-old competing in child beauty pageants appeared in the tabloids, while armchair detectives filled the airwaves, debating the contents of the ransom note.",
      "Unidentified male DNA was left on the child and tests, performed just weeks after the murder, excluded anyone from the Ramsey family, including JonBenet's 9-year-old brother\u00a0Burke. Those results were initially kept from the press and public as investigators continued to focus mostly on John and Patsy Ramsey as suspects in their daughter's murder.",
      "While the couple gave DNA, hair, blood and writing samples in the days following the murder, they hired attorneys and didn't speak to investigators until several months later, in April 1997, and again in June 1998. Video from that 1998 interrogation, aired publicly for the first time by \"48 Hours,\" shows a combative Patsy Ramsey denying any involvement in her daughter's murder. When told that investigators had scientific trace evidence linking her, she responded, \"That is totally impossible. Go retest.\" She then added, \"I don't give a flying flip how scientific it is. Go back to the damn drawing board. I didn't do it. John Ramsey didn't do it. So we all got to start working together from here, this day forward to try to find out who the hell did it.\"",
      "In 2008, after more DNA tests again excluded the Ramsey family, the Boulder District Attorney at that time, Mary Lacy, publicly exonerated the Ramseys and sent them a letter of apology.",
      "Investigators considered the theory that JonBen\u00e9t may have been killed by an intruder, and over the years, looked at other persons of interest, including a neighbor who played Santa Claus and at least two people who confessed to the murder.",
      "The only arrest in the case was made in 2006 after a man living in Thailand by the name of John Mark Karr claimed to have drugged, sexually assaulted and accidentally killed JonBen\u00e9t. No drugs, however, had been found in the child and Karr's DNA did not match what was left at the scene. Karr was later released.",
      "Patsy Ramsey never lived to see the Boulder district attorney's apology or have her name cleared. In 2006, she died, at age 49, of ovarian cancer. But John Ramsey, who remarried in 2011, has continued to push the Boulder police to find and arrest his daughter's killer.",
      "If JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey had lived, she would have turned 34 years old in August. In an interview with \"48 Hours\" in November, John Ramsey said he can't imagine his daughter as a grown woman, but only as a 6-year-old. He said he is confident that the unknown male DNA profile in the case will ultimately lead to a suspect in her murder. He is asking investigators in Boulder to turn over that DNA to an independent private lab that can employ the same technology, genetic genealogy, that was used to identify the Golden State Killer in 2018, and countless others since.",
      "Ramsey also said there are seven items of evidence from the family's home that could still be tested for DNA including, he said, the garrote used to strangle JonBen\u00e9t, a rope found in a guest bedroom, as well as a blanket. The Boulder Police Department, however, in a release in November, disputed Ramsey's contention that they are not testing evidence.",
      "\"The assertion that there is viable evidence and leads we are not pursuing\u2014to include DNA testing \u2014 is completely false,\" read a Boulder Police statement. Still, in a nearly six-minute video that was also released, the current Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn admits, \"there were things that people have pointed to throughout the years that could have been done better and we acknowledge that is true.\"",
      "John Ramsey, who turned 81 in early December, has lived under a cloud of suspicion for nearly three decades, but he said the weight of constant public scrutiny was nothing compared to the loss of his child.",
      "\"It was just noise level stuff,\" Ramsey said, \"We were so devastated and crushed by the loss of JonBen\u00e9t \u2026 it didn't matter \u2026 it didn't matter.\"",
      "He is speaking out now, he said, because an arrest in the case would finally give some peace to his son Burke, now in his 30s, and his two older children from his first marriage.",
      "\"\u2026 identifying the killer,\" he said, \"isn't gonna change my life at this point, but it will change the lives of my children and my grandchildren. This cloud needs to be removed from our family's head and this chapter closed for their benefit.\"",
      "In addition to fighting to keep his daughter's case in the public eye, Ramsey is working to see the passage of The Homicide Victims' Families' Rights Act, which would allow a murder victim's family to request a federal review of their case.",
      "\"That would be a huge step forward to fix a fundamental problem in our system in this country,\" Ramsey said, \"not a complete solution, but it's a step forward.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:18:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

    "story": [
      "Although 2024 is winding down, the U.S. housing crisis\u00a0lives on. But even as steep home prices and elevated mortgage rates sideline many would-be homebuyers, some real estate markets around the country continue to attract them.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) this month released a list of 10 local housing markets it expects to be hot spots in 2025, outperforming the rest of the country in sales. The locations have been chosen by NAR based on their current individual strengths across 10 key economic, demographic and housing factors that are considered predictors of future market activity.",
      "\"Important factors common among the top-performing markets in 2025 include available inventory at affordable price points, a better chance of unlocking low mortgage rates, higher income growth for young adults and net migration into specific metro areas,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist and senior vice president of research, in the report.",
      "One of those factors is the share of \"locked-in\" homeowners in a given area \u2014 those with low mortgage rates from previous years who are in no rush to sell and take on new loans at much higher rates. Areas with fewer locked-in homeowners were considered by NAR to be hotter than others as they are more likely to see properties listed. More listings means and more opportunities for buyers.",
      "Predictions for 2025",
      "NAR expects mortgage rates to stabilize, if not fall as sharply as some house-hunters were hoping, next year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its third straight cut in its benchmark rate, lowering the federal funds rate by another quarter of a percentage point. Although mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate moves, they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rising or falling along with the return on government debt.",
      "NAR thinks the Fed will continue to cut borrowing costs in 2025 and predicts that mortgage rates will settle around 6%, bringing in millions more buyers back to the market. The Fed is now hinting at only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection in September of four. Experts expect mortgage rates may come down slightly with the Fed's the latest reduction possibly contributing to a modest decline.",
      "The real estate group also expects home prices to rise further in the coming year, though more slowly than in 2024. The number of homes on the market is \u00a0and will continue to increase in 2025.",
      "\"Homebuyers will have more success next year,\" Yun said in the report. \"The worst of the affordability challenges are over as more inventory, stable mortgage rates and continued job and income growth pave the way for more Americans to achieve homeownership.\"",
      "Here, in alphabetical order, are NAR's 10 top housing hot spots for 2025.",
      "Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire",
      "Buying a home in Boston-Cambridge-Newton area isn't exactly cheap, with home prices averaging $694,494, according to Zillow. That's more than $200,000 north of the national average home price of\u00a0$430,584.",
      "Still, the metro area has a number of strengths. For one, NAR expects the local housing market, which includes portions of southern New Hampshire, next year to benefit from stabilizing mortgage rates, which would likely mean fewer locked-in homeowners. Mortgage rates in Boston typically skew lower than the national average, according to the real estate group, which noted that Boston also has a good number starter-homes. Typically priced at 85% of the median-priced home, starter homes are critical for first-time buyers.",
      "Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, North Carolina-South Carolina",
      "In addition to 10% job growth over the last five years, Charlotte has a significant share of affordable housing, with 43% of homes priced below $324,000 \u2014 a huge draw for first-time buyers and young families. The average interest rate in the area is 6.85%, slightly below the national average of 6.89% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.",
      "Grand Rapids-Kentwood, Michigan",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers an ample stock of affordable homes, with the average home price at $271,960, while mortgage rates hover around 6.9%, slightly above the national average. But because Grand Rapids has a small proportion of mortgage originations with rates below 6%, NAR predicts fewer lock-ins and more listings in 2025.",
      "Greenville-Anderson, South Carolina",
      "With home prices averaging $307,315 and a large influx of new residents, houses in Greenville don't stay listed for long \u2014 typically about 17 days. Mortgage rates run just above the national average, at 6.9%, most likely because of recent foreclosures happening in the state, according to MorgageRates.com.",
      "NAR points to the 42% of homes categorized as starter homes in Greenville as another reason why it predicts the local housing market will be a standout for families and young professionals in 2025.",
      "Hartford-East-Hartford-Middletown, Connecticut",
      "When it comes to affordability, Hartford's average home price of $178,696 is hard to beat. In 2023, The city's average mortgage rate of 6.5% was one of the lowest among the top markets. Connecticut's capital city also has the highest proportion of homeowners surpassing the area's average tenure of 17 years, an indication of a potential increase in local inventory, according to NAR.",
      "Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Indiana",
      "Indianapolis made NAR's list because of strong job growth and housing affordability. Nearly 42% of the housing stock is priced below $236,000, with the average home value at $223,261. \"With fewer 'locked-in' homeowners than the national level, this area is likely to see more available inventory as mortgage rates stabilize around 6% next year,\" according to NAR.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas",
      "Kansas City's generally lower average mortgage rate and smaller share of locked-in homeowners makes it a favorable market for financing and inventory. The average house is priced at $233,826, making homeownership in the area affordable for one in three millennials. Affordability plus competitive financing will make the Kansas City housing market a top performer in 2025, according to NAR.",
      "Knoxville, Tennessee",
      "One of the hottest housing markets in Tennessee, Knoxville is a place where newcomers go to settle down \u2014 roughly 50% of movers to the area decide to buy a home, NAR says. The average value of a home in Knoxville is $350,614, making this city located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains affordable compared with other major cities.",
      "Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Arizona",
      "The average home value in Phoenix is $414,977. The relatively affordable housing stock, plus a comparatively lower cost of living and strong job growth, have made Arizona's capital city a key destination for Californians looking to relocate. \"Demographic shifts and economic expansion has established Phoenix as a prosperous and dynamic market,\" according to NAR.",
      "San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas",
      "The average home in San Antonio is priced at\u00a0$250,834, which makes it one of the few markets to see a decrease in residential real estate costs over the past year. The city, home of The Alamo, also has had one of the strongest records of job growth in the U.S. in recent years, according to the NAR report, and it continues to attract a steady influx of new residents.",

In fiscal year 2019, ICE reported 267,000 deportations, the peak under the Trump administration. Fiscal years start in October and end in September.",
      "While the incoming Trump administration has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in American history next year, the statistics released by ICE show the Biden administration has already overseen a dramatic increase in deportations in its final year in office.",
      "In fiscal year 2021, which included the first months of the Biden administration, ICE deportations plunged to 59,000, a record low for the 21-year-old agency. The drop was mainly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and rules enacted by the Biden administration that efficiently shielded most unauthorized immigrants from deportation if they were not serious criminals, national security threats or recent border crossers.",
      "ICE deportations increased to 72,000 in fiscal year 2022 and then to 143,000 in fiscal year 2023, as the Biden administration increased deportation efforts in response to record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, and as border officials relied less heavily on a pandemic-era expulsion policy known as Title 42. Expulsions of migrants under that measure were not counted as formal deportations because they were carried out under a public health law.",
      "Border crackdown fueled jump in deportations",
      "In the report it released Thursday, ICE said the sharp jump in deportations last fiscal year stemmed from increased steps to streamline the deportation process, as well as diplomatic efforts to convince countries to take back more deportees. The agency noted that it increased deportations flights to traditional migrant-sending countries in Latin America, but also to far-flung nations in Africa and Asia, including China, which did not accept U.S. deportations for years.",
      "Most of the deportations in fiscal year 2024 involved migrants who were apprehended by U.S. border officials, as opposed to those arrested by ICE in the interior of the country, the agency report shows. Roughly 82% of the 271,000 immigrants deported that year were first arrested by Customs and Border Protection. The rest were initially arrested by ICE in jails or during operations in communities.",
      "ICE's deportation numbers don't include removals and returns of migrants by Border Patrol officials at the U.S.-Mexico border. Those returns also increased this year after President Biden sharply limited asylum through a June executive order that, alongside Mexico's efforts to interdict migrants, led to a dramatic decrease in illegal border crossings.",
      "What's awaiting the Trump administration?",
      "While deportations rose significantly this past year, the Trump administration will still inherit a massive workload at ICE, which is tracking millions of unauthorized immigrants.",
      "At the end of fiscal year 2024, ICE's so-called non-detained docket of cases of immigrants facing deportation due to immigration violations had ballooned to nearly 7.7 million, up from 3.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. The spike in cases mainly reflects the record releases of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border during Mr. Biden's presidency before he announced the asylum restrictions in June.",
      "The incoming Trump administration has promised to start a wave of mass deportations as soon as the president-elect takes office on Jan. 20. Incoming border czar Tom Homan has said ICE will first target unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and the estimated 1.4 million people with pending deportation orders. But he has also stressed no one in the country illegally will be exempt from deportation.",
      "To carry out the deportations at the monumental scale that incoming Trump administration officials have outlined, ICE would need a dramatic infusion in resources and manpower, as the agency currently has 41,000 detention beds and roughly 6,000 deportation officers. There were more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in early 2022, according to the latest government estimate.",
      "Homan has suggested enlisting the Department of Defense to help ICE, including by allowing the agency to carry out deportations using military aircraft. Incoming White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has also floated a proposal to deputize National Guard soldiers to arrest and deport immigrants living in the country illegally.",

    "title": "How Trump could undo portions of Biden's climate legacy",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Biden's most recent climate initiatives are all but certain to be short-lived, mostly thanks to an obscure law that tends to come into play every four years.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election set in motion a race against time by President Biden to safeguard his environmental legacy in his remaining days as president.",
      "But his administration's stepped-up pace of climate-related announcements will likely mean little once Trump is inaugurated and the Republican-led Congress is seated in January. Mr. Biden's most recent climate initiatives are all but certain to be short-lived, mostly thanks to an obscure law that tends to come into play every four years.",
      "That law, the Congressional Review Act, allows Congress to kill any regulation issued by a federal agency in the last 60 legislative days with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate and the signature of the president.",
      "Since Election Day, the Biden administration has announced final rules that include one to dramatically curb methane emissions and another that bans all future coal mining leases on federal lands. Both rules are expected to be rolled back soon after Trump takes office.",
      "Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide, but it traps heat in the atmosphere at 28 times the rate of carbon dioxide, the Environmental Protection Agency has observed. On the upside, methane doesn't remain in the atmosphere for as long as CO2, so cutting methane emissions can have a much quicker, more dramatic impact on lowering greenhouse gases. Human sources of methane emissions include oil and gas systems, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and a host of other industrial processes.",
      "On Nov. 12, the Biden administration announced a final rule that will charge oil and natural gas companies a hefty fee if they exceed methane emission limits. It's an effort to encourage these companies to improve their processes to reduce methane leaks.",
      "The EPA estimates that implementing the methane emissions rule would be akin to taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.",
      "The Biden administration also recently blocked all new coal mining leases on public lands, which would affect new leases in Wyoming and Montana, the source of 40% of the nation's coal. The Associated Press pointed to government analyses that said ending federal leasing would reduce emissions by the equivalent of 293 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, roughly on par with eliminating emissions from 63 million gas-powered cars.",
      "Existing leases would still allow mining in the region to continue for decades. But coal has been losing ground in recent years, as the U.S. has steadily come to rely more on cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources \u2014 and less on coal.",
      "Republican politicians in Wyoming and Montana denounced the ban, and GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said in a statement that he's ready to work with Trump to reverse the ban and other regulations.",
      "In Trump's view, fears about climate change are overblown or premature. He's called it a \"hoax\" in the past. He opposes clean energy and EV subsidies and has said what America needs to do is \"drill, baby drill\" \u2014 that is, increase traditional oil and gas production in order to bring down energy prices for Americans. This shouldn't come as a surprise \u2014 in his first term, upon taking office, he overturned 100 environmental rules enacted by President Obama.",
      "During his presidential campaign, Trump promised business-friendly policies that he claimed would halve energy costs in a year by approving new drilling and slashing red tape.",
      "Some experts doubt that'll happen.",
      "\"There is no universe in which decisions by the federal government can cause that extent of a reaction from markets,\" Jonathan Elkind, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University told CBS News. \"The oil markets, they are too big, they are too global, and the president of the United States does not have the capability to exert influence that is as strong as that.\"",
      "There are still, however, some Biden climate policies that are likely to be out of Trump's reach.",
      "Billions in clean energy investment was set aside in the 2022 climate law, the most significant climate change legislation ever signed. But the key to protecting that funding is making sure the money is spent, or allocated, before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.",
      "Once the grant money is spent, Trump and Republicans are highly unlikely to be able to claw it back.",
      "\"Legally, any obligated fund is safe,\" said Christina DeConcini, director of government affairs at World Resources Institute. \"If you listen to incoming administration officials, they are saying that they're going to go after that. I don't think they're going to have a legal leg to stand on if it's been obligated.\"",
      "The EPA says it's learned over the years that the surest way to protect climate policy is to tie a regulation directly to legislation and funding.",
      "In total, about $643.1 billion, or over 93% of funding available, has been obligated, according to a White House official. Billions remain to be spent under the climate law in the next fiscal year, and some Republicans may want to keep the climate spending in their districts and states.",
      "Trying to take the grant funding back would mean \"potentially taking away benefits to communities, both in terms of public health protections, but also economic benefits,\" EPA senior adviser for implementation Zealan Hoover told CBS News.",
      "And these grants are also far from the most expensive line-items in the climate law. The Energy Department announced almost $18 million for projects that bolster recycling programs, launch residential energy efficiency rebate programs and expand bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, among other projects. The Agriculture Department put $256 million toward the Rural Energy Program for America to expand use of wind, solar, geothermal and small hydropower energy.",
      "These kinds of projects and the grants are likely to be safe through Trump's second term.",

      "Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said he was \"appalled\" by the attack, and that authorities are still working to determine exactly what happened. He said several children have been taken to various hospitals in Zagreb.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 07:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "There's concern about whether emigration after Oct. 7, 2023 will drive a \"brain drain\" in sectors like medicine and tech.",
    "story": [
      "Leaving Israel is easier, Shira Z. Carmel thinks, by saying it's just for now. But she knows better.",
      "For the Israeli-born singer and an increasing number of relatively well-off Israelis, the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack shattered any sense of safety and along with it, Israel's founding promise: to be the world's safe haven for Jews. That day, thousands of Hamas militants blew past the country's border defenses, killed 1,200 Israelis and dragged 250 more into Gaza in a siege that caught the Israeli army by surprise and stunned a nation that prides itself on its military prowess. This time, during what became known as Israel's 9/11, the army didn't come for hours.",
      "Ten days later, a pregnant Carmel, her husband and their toddler boarded a flight to Australia, which was looking for people in her husband's profession. And they spun the explanation to friends and family as something other than permanent \u2014 \"relocation\" is the easier-to-swallow term \u2014 acutely aware of the familial strain and the shame that have shadowed Israelis who leave for good.",
      "\"We told them we're going to get out of the line of fire for awhile,\" Carmel said more than a year later from her family's new home in Melbourne. \"It wasn't a hard decision. But it was very hard to talk to them about it. It was even hard to admit it to ourselves.\"",
      "Thousands of Israelis have left the country since Oct. 7, 2023, according to government statistics and immigration tallies released by destination countries such as Canada and Germany. There's concern about whether it will drive a \"brain drain\" in sectors like medicine and tech. Migration experts say it's possible people leaving Israel will surpass the number of immigrants to Israel in 2024, according to Sergio DellaPergola, a statistician and professor emeritus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.",
      "Thousands of Israelis have opted to pay the financial, emotional and social costs of moving out since the Oct. 7 attack, according to government statistics and families who spoke to The Associated Press in recent months after emigrating to Canada, Spain and Australia.",
      "Israel's population continues to grow toward 10 million people. But it's possible that 2024 ends with more Israelis leaving the country than coming in. That's even as Israel and Hezbollah reached a fragile ceasefire along the border with Lebanon and Israel and Hamas inch toward a pause in Gaza.",
      "Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated in September that 40,600 Israelis departed long-term over the first seven months of 2024, a 59% increase over the same period a year earlier, when 25,500 people left. Monthly, 2,200 more people departed this year than in 2023, the bureau reported.",
      "The Israeli Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, which does not deal with people leaving, said more than 33,000 people have moved to Israel since the start of the war, about on par with previous years. The interior minister refused to comment for this story, a spokesperson said.",
      "Other clues, too, point to a notable departure of Israelis since the Oct. 7 attacks. Gil Fire, deputy director of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, said some of its star specialists with fellowship postings of a few years in other countries began to waver about returning.",
      "\"Before the war, they always came back and it was not really considered an option to stay. And during the war, we started to see a change,\" he said. \"They said to us, 'We will stay another year, maybe two years, maybe more.'\"",
      "Fire says it's \"an issue of concern\" enough for him to plan in-person visits with these doctors to try to draw them back to Israel.",
      "Michal Harel, who moved with her husband to Toronto in 2019, said that almost immediately after the attacks, the phone began ringing \u2014 with other Israelis seeking advice about moving to Canada. On Nov. 23, 2023, the couple set up a website to help Israelis navigate moving, which can cost at least 100,000 Israeli shekels, or about $28,000, Harel and other Israeli relocation experts said.",
      "Not everyone in Israel can just pack up and move overseas. Many of those who have made the move have foreign passports, jobs at multinational corporations or can work remotely. People in Gaza, where local health officials say more than 45,000 people have been killed, have even less choice. Harel reported that the site has received views from 100,000 unique visitors and 5,000 direct contacts in 2024 alone.",
      "Aliya \u2014 the Hebrew term for used for immigration, literally the \"ascent\" of Jews into Israel - has always been part of the country's plan. But \"yerida\" \u2014 the term used for leaving the country, literally the \"descent\" of Jews from Israel to the diaspora, emphatically has not.",
      "A sacred trust and a social contract took root in Israeli society. The terms go \u2014 or went \u2014 like this: Israeli citizens would serve in the military and pay high taxes. In exchange, the army would keep them safe. Meanwhile, it's every Jew's obligation to stay, work and fight for Israel's survival.",
      "\"Emigration was a threat, especially in the early years (when) there were problems of nation-building,\" said Ori Yehudai, a professor of Israel studies at Ohio State University and the author of \"Leaving Zion,\" a history of Israeli emigration. \"People still feel they have to justify their decision to move.\"",
      "Shira Carmel says she has no doubt about her decision. She'd long objected to Netanyahu's government's efforts to overhaul the legal system, and was one of the first women to don the blood-red \"Handmaid's Tale\" robes that became a fixture of the the anti-government protests of 2023. She was terrified as a new mom, and a pregnant one, during the Hamas attack. This was not the life she wanted.",
      "Meanwhile, Australia beckoned. Carmel's brother had lived there for two decades. The couple had the equivalent of a green card due to Carmel's husband's profession. Basic logic, she says, pointed toward moving. They were able to catch a free flight out on seven hours' notice.",
      "And yet, Carmel recalls the frenzied hours before the flight out in which she said to her husband in the privacy of their bedroom: \"My God, are we really doing this?\"",
      "They decided not to decide. They packed lightly. But weeks in Australia became months, and the couple decided to have the baby there. They told their families back in Israel that they were staying \"for now.\"",
      "\"We don't define it as 'forever,'\" Carmel said on Tuesday. \"But we are for sure staying for the foreseeable future.\"",

    "story": [
      "Malaysia announced on Friday it has agreed to launch a new search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared 10 years ago in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries.",
      "The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.",
      "Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has never been found. Malaysia's prime minister said 17 days after the plane disappeared that, based on the satellite data, his government had\u00a0concluded that the plane crashed down\u00a0in a remote corner of the Indian Ocean, and that there were no survivors.",
      "Transport Minister Anthony Loke said Malaysia had agreed to a new search operation by maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which also carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.",
      "The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017.",
      "Loke said a new 5,800 square mile area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity, which is based in the United Kingdom and United States.",
      "\"The new search area proposed by Ocean Infinity is based on the latest information and data analysis conducted by experts and researchers,\" Loke said.",
      "\"The proposal for a search operation by Ocean Infinity is a solid one and deserves to be considered,\" he told reporters.",
      "The government said it agreed to Ocean Infinity's proposal \"in principle\" on December 13, with the transport ministry expected to finalize terms by early 2025.",
      "The new search will resume \"as soon as the contract is finalized and signed by both parties,\" Loke said.",
      "\"They have informed us that the ideal time for the search in the designated waters is between January and April. We are working to finalise the agreement as quickly as possible,\" he added.",
      "\"I truly hope there will be an end to the loss of MH370. May all questions be answered,\" Malaysian Rosila Abu Samah, 60, the stepmother of one of the passengers, told AFP.",
      "Malaysian Shim Kok Chau, 49, whose wife was a flight attendant on the ill-fated flight, said he had come to accept her fate but hopes to know what happened to the plane, \"why it happened and who did it.\"",
      "Among the other victims was a celebrated group of 24 Chinese calligraphy artists coming from an exhibition of their work. Two young Iranian men on the plane, 18-year-old Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad and 29-year-old Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, were traveling on stolen passports to seek better lives in Europe.",
      "Two of the U.S. citizens on the plane were young children, Nicole Meng, 4, and 2-year-old Yan Zhang.",
      "Philip Wood was the only\u00a0American adult on the flight. The IBM executive had been living in Beijing and was planning to relocate to the Malaysian capital with his girlfriend, Sarah Bajc.",
      "\"No find, no fee\"",
      "The new search will be on the same \"no find, no fee\" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if they find the aircraft.",
      "The contract is for 18 months and Malaysia will pay $70 million to the company if the plane is found, Loke said.",
      "He said the decision to agree to a fresh search \"reflects the Malaysian government's commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure to the families of the MH370 victims.\"",
      "The original Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometers in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane, with only some pieces of debris picked up.",
      "In July 2015, an airplane fragment later\u00a0confirmed to be a flaperon\u00a0from MH370 was found washed ashore on the western Indian Ocean island of Reunion. It was the first hard evidence that the plane had gone down in the area. More debris was later found washed up on the coast of eastern Africa.",
      "The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories \u2014 including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.",
      "A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.",
      "Asked if he was confident the plane will be found during the new search, Loke said: \"At this point, no one can provide guarantees.",
      "\"It has been over 10 years, and it would be unfair to expect a concrete commitment. However, under the terms and conditions, any discovery must be credible. It cannot just be a few fragments; there are specific criteria outlined in the contract.\"",

    "summary": "Hostage envoy Roger Carstens is in Syria making the first known in-person U.S. in-person contact with the caretaker government and seeking help in finding missing American Austin Tice.",
    "story": [
      "Roger Carstens, the Biden administration's top official for freeing Americans held overseas, on Friday arrived in Damascus, Syria, for a high-risk mission: making the first known face-to-face contact with the caretaker government and asking for help finding missing American journalist Austin Tice.",
      "Tice was kidnapped in Syria 12 years ago during the civil war and brutal reign of now-deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. For years, U.S. officials have said they do not know with certainty whether Tice is still alive, where he is being held or by whom.",
      "The State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, accompanied Carstens to Damascus as a gesture of broader outreach to Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, the rebel group that recently overthrew Assad's regime and is emerging as a leading power.",
      "Near East Senior Adviser Daniel Rubinstein was also with the delegation. They are the first American diplomats to visit Damascus in over a decade, according to a State Department spokesperson.",
      "They plan to meet with HTS representatives to discuss transition principles endorsed by the U.S. and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan, the spokesperson said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Aqaba last week to meet with Middle East leaders and discuss the situation in Syria.",
      "While finding and freeing Tice and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime is the ultimate goal, U.S. officials are downplaying expectations of a breakthrough on this trip. Multiple sources told CBS News that Carstens and Leaf's intent is to convey U.S. interests to senior HTS leaders, and learn anything they can about Tice.",
      "Rubinstein will lead the U.S. diplomacy in Syria, engaging directly with the Syrian people and key parties in Syria, the State Department spokesperson added.",
      "Diplomatic outreach to HTS comes in a volatile, war-torn region at an uncertain moment. Two sources even compared the potential danger to the expeditionary diplomacy practiced by the late U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who led outreach to rebels in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and was killed in a terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound and intelligence post.",
      "U.S. special operations forces known as JSOC provided security for the delegation as they traveled by vehicle across the Jordanian border and on the road to Damascus. The convoy was given assurances by HTS that it would be granted safe passage while in Syria, but there remains a threat of attacks by other terrorist groups, including ISIS.",
      "CBS News withheld publication of this story for security concerns at the State Department's request.",
      "Sending high-level American diplomats to Damascus represents a significant step in reopening U.S.-Syria relations following the fall of the Assad regime less than two weeks ago. Operations at the U.S. embassy in Damascus have been suspended since 2012, shortly after the Assad regime brutally repressed an uprising that became a 14-year civil war and spawned 13 million Syrians to flee the country in one of the largest humanitarian disasters in the world.",
      "The U.S. formally designated HTS, which had ties to al Qaeda, as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. Its leader, Mohammed al Jolani, was designated as a terrorist by the US in 2013 and prior to that served time in a US prison in Iraq.",
      "Since toppling Assad, HTS has publicly signaled interest in a new more moderate trajectory. Al Jolani even shed his nom de guerre and now uses his legal name, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "U.S. sanctions on HTS linked to those terrorist designations complicate outreach somewhat, but they haven't prevented American officials from making direct contact with HTS at the direction of President Biden. Blinken recently confirmed that U.S. officials were in touch with HTS representatives prior to Carstens and Leaf's visit.",
      "\"We've heard positive statements coming from Mr. Jolani, the leader of HTS,\" Blinken told Bloomberg News on Thursday. \"But what everyone is focused on is what's actually happening on the ground, what are they doing? Are they working to build a transition in Syria that brings everyone in?\"",
      "In that same interview, Blinken also seemed to dangle the possibility that the U.S. could help lift sanctions on HTS and its leader imposed by the United Nations, if HTS builds what he called an inclusive nonsectarian government and eventually holds elections. The Biden administration is not expected to lift the U.S.\u00a0 terrorist designation before the end of the president's\u00a0 term on January 20th.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder disclosed Thursday that the U.S. currently has approximately 2,000 US troops inside of Syria as part of the mission to defeat ISIS, a far higher number than the 900 troops the Biden administration had previously acknowledged. There are at least five U.S. military bases in the north and south of the country.",
      "The Biden administration is concerned that thousands of ISIS prisoners held at a camp known as al-Hol could be freed. It is currently guarded by the Syrian Democratic forces, Kurdish allies of the U.S. who are wary of the newly-powerful HTS. The situation on the ground is rapidly changing since Russia and Iran withdrew military support from the Assad regime, which has reset the balance of power. Turkey, which has been a sometimes problematic U.S. ally, has been a conduit to HTS and is emerging as a power broker.",
      "A high-risk mission like this is unusual for the typically risk averse Biden administration, which has exercised consistently restrained diplomacy. Blinken approved Carstens and Leaf's trip and relevant congressional leaders were briefed on it days ago.",
      "\"I think it's important to have direct communication, it's important to speak as clearly as possible, to listen, to make sure that we understand as best we can where they're going and where they want to go,\" Blinken said Thursday.",

    "summary": "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said she had no regrets, but hope for the future after a judge sentenced her ex-husband to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping her for years.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in France on Thursday found the former husband of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who\u00a0admitted\u00a0to drugging and raping her repeatedly over the course of almost a decade and inviting dozens of other men to assault her as well, guilty of aggravated rape. Forty-nine men whom Dominique Pelicot brought into his home to assault his wife were also convicted Thursday as part of the same landmark trial.",
      "The man convicted of orchestrating the sustained assaults over the years was given the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while his co-accused were handed sentences ranging from three to 15 years.",
      "Over the course of the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u2014 who insisted that her full name be published and the court\u00a0proceedings be made public \u2014 was praised for her courage and became a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France and around the world.",
      "\"I want to express my gratitude, very profound, to all the people who supported me during this difficult time. Your witness, your statements, have really moved me and they have given me the strength to come back every day for these long days of the trial,\" Pelicot told journalists outside the court Thursday.",
      "\"I wanted to open the doors of this trial last September so that society could see what was happening. I'll never regret this decision. I have confidence in our capacity, collectively, to find a better future, in which men and women alike can live harmlessly together with mutual respect,\" she said.",
      "Roger Arata, the lead judge at the court in Avignon, southeast France, read out the verdicts for Dominique Pelicot and the 49 other men convicted of raping his former wife in her own bed at his invitation. One other man was accused of aggravated sexual assault. All the men were found guilty, but one had his conviction reduced from rape to sexual assault, and two of their sentences were suspended.",
      "\"The children are disappointed by these low sentences,\" one of Pelicot's family members, who asked not to be named, told the French news agency AFP.",
      "Pelicot was greeted as she arrived at the court Thursday by crowds holding signs with slogans such as: \"Thank you for your courage.\" She and her daughters sat in the courtroom as the verdicts were read out, resting their heads against a wall, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The trial began on Sept. 2 and, almost every day, Pelicot came face to face with her former husband, Dominique, or one of the 50 other men charged with assaulting her. She insisted that videos submitted as evidence, made by her ex-husband and showing men assaulting her while she appeared unconscious, be shown in the court.",
      "Her ex-husband was also found guilty of the attempted aggravated rape of a woman named Cillia, the wife of another man, Jean Pierre Marechal, who was one of the co-accused, as well as taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline, and his daughters-in-law, Celine and Aurore, BBC News reported. Sitting in court, he showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out, according to the BBC. After the verdict and sentencing, his lawyer said he would have ten days to make an appeal, which he was considering.",
      "What happened to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot?",
      "The assaults took place between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was taken into custody. Police found thousands of photos and videos of the abuse on his computer drives, which helped lead them to other suspects. Some of the men said in court that they believed the unconscious woman was okay with it, or that her husband's permission was sufficient.",
      "Speaking in court during the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who is 72, talked about how she had thought she was in a loving marriage with her husband and would never have guessed what was happening.",
      "\"We would have a glass of white wine together. I never found anything strange about my potatoes,\" Pelicot told the court. \"We finished eating. Often when it's a football match on TV, I'd let him watch it alone. He brought my ice cream to my bed, where I was. My favorite flavor \u2014 raspberry \u2014 and I thought: 'How lucky I am. He's a love.'\"",
      "She said she never had any inkling that he was drugging her with the snacks.",
      "\"I never felt my heart flutter. I didn't feel anything. I must have gone under very quickly. I would wake up with my pajamas on,\" Pelicot told the court, adding that she would sometimes wake up \"more tired than usual, but I walk a lot and thought it was that.",
      "\"I'm trying to understand,\" she said, \"how this husband, who was the perfect man, could have got to this.\"",
      "Her then-husband recruited the other men to come and assault his wife via online chat rooms. The 50 other men accused in the case come from all walks of life and professions, and most were residents of the area.",
      "\"It's not for us to feel shame \u2014 it's for them,\" Pelicot declared during the trial, referring to the attackers. \"Above all, I'm expressing my will and determination to change this society.\"",
      "Pelicot continued attending the hearings throughout the trial, in part, because she \"felt she was somehow representing the victims of these kinds of abuses,\" her lawyer, St\u00e9phane Babonneau, said ahead of the verdicts being delivered on Thursday. \"There are very many victims that are going to trial, facing their aggressors without having anyone outside, lining up for them, offering flowers. So she felt that she needed to continue to keep focus, because she didn't elect to, but she felt that she was somehow representing the victims, and she felt responsible for that.\"",
      "Controversial French laws",
      "Pelicot's case triggered protests across France, and there was hope among some demonstrators that the case could lead to changes in controversial French laws governing sexual consent.",
      "France introduced a legal age of sexual consent in 2021 after a public outcry over the rape of an 11-year-old schoolgirl by a man who was initially convicted on a lesser charge. Since then, sex with anyone under the age of 15 has been viewed as non-consensual, but French law does not refer to consent in cases involving older victims.",
      "Under French law, rape is defined as penetration or oral sex using \"violence, coercion, threat or surprise,\" without taking consent into account, according to the Reuters news agency. Prosecutors must, therefore, prove an intention to rape if they are to be successful in court, legal experts told Reuters.",
      "Just 14% of rape accusations in France lead to formal investigations, according to a study by the Institute of Public Policies.",
      "\"Why don't we manage to obtain convictions? The first reason is the law,\" French legal expert Catherine Le Magueresse told Reuters. \"The law is written in such a way that victims must comply with the stereotype of a 'good victim' and a 'true rape': an unknown attacker, use of violence, and the victim's resistance. But it is only true for a minority of rapes.\"",

    "story": [
      "Southern Gaza Strip \u2014\u00a0In a rare moment of access to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory, CBS News visited a critical aid distribution center on Wednesday just inside the Gaza Strip, near the Karem Shalom border crossing from Israel. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza after more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war remains dire.",
      "Israeli officials say about 200 trucks cross from Israel into Gaza via the Kerem Shalom checkpoint every day, on average, carrying desperately needed supplies for Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire of the ongoing conflict.",
      "But a pressing question persists: Is the aid reaching those who need it most?",
      "At the distribution center, truck drivers and aid workers told CBS News about the struggles they face, including the looting of humanitarian goods, which they said remained a significant problem in Gaza. The chaos and lawlessness in the region often prevents supplies from reaching the intended recipients.",
      "\"The aid is not getting through because of the gangs intercepting it on the road,\" says Mohammed Shehibar, a Palestinian logistics coordinator from Al-Rimal, a neighborhood in Gaza City, who spoke with us as he oversaw workers loading forklifts full of fresh fruit.",
      "He said that of 100 trucks that went out from this site, \"only 70 or 60 reached their destinations.\" The rest, he said, were looted.",
      "\"The only guarantee to get aid delivered safely is that there would [be] some stability in Gaza,\" he said. \"They [the gangs] take up positions near the border \u2026 near the [Israeli] army \u2026 and they don't face any problems.\"",
      "International aid agencies have also complained that not enough aid is entering the Gaza Strip.",
      "Last Sunday on CBS News' \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Cindy McCain, the head of the World Food Program, said her organization had only been able to get two aid trucks through the crossing in the month of November.",
      "\"That's not true,\" said Col. Abdullah Halabi, the head of Israel's Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza. \"The humanitarian community just in the last two weeks, with our development of facilities around Gaza, like on other crossings, they managed to move an average of 200 trucks to the central and to the south of Gaza.\"",
      "Israeli officials insist that ample aid is flowing into Gaza. They emphasize the difficulties of delivering supplies in an active war zone and call for greater assistance from the international community to ensure safe passage and effective distribution within the decimated enclave.",
      "Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza following Hamas' brutal attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people. More than 100 hostages seized by Hamas are still being held. Since the start of the war in Gaza, at least 44,580 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, and most of its residents have been internally displaced.",
      "Danger was palpable during our visit, with the sound of shelling echoing nearby. Aid truck drivers risk their lives to navigate the perilous conditions created by shattered infrastructure and security threats inside Gaza, highlighting the immense challenges faced by both aid agencies and Gazan civilians.",
      "There has been cautious hope recently, however, as reports suggest ongoing negotiations for a hostage release deal could lead to a temporary ceasefire, and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza.",
      "If such a deal does materialize, distribution centers like the one on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing may soon be overwhelmed with additional supplies, offering a lifeline to those in desperate need.",

Lt. General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian military's chemical and biological weapons unit, was killed by a bomb planted in a scooter in Moscow on Tuesday, the boldest assassination claimed by Kyiv since the start of the conflict.",
      "\"Our special services are missing these hits. They missed these hits. It means we need to improve this work. We must not allow such very serious blunders to happen,\" Putin said at his end-of-year press conference, addressing a string of attacks inside Russia on high-profile Kremlin backers amid Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine has been linked to previous attacks in Russia, including the August 2022 car bombing of nationalist Darya Dugina and an explosion in a Saint Petersburg cafe in April 2023 that killed high-profile military correspondent Maxim Fomin, known as Vladlen Tatarsky.",
      "Putin was addressing the killing of Kirillov for the first time, more than 48 hours after the blast in a residential part of the Russian capital. Questions have been asked in Moscow about the security protocols for such a high-ranking and public figure involved in the military offensive on Ukraine.",
      "Kyiv claimed responsibility for the attack, saying explosives were packed into an electric scooter left by the door of a residential building.",
      "When Kirillov and his assistant left the building, it detonated, killing them both.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 19:38:00 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Damascus \u2014 In a remote corner outside Damascus, Syria, a now abandoned potato chip factory reveals one of the many dark but open secrets of the ousted regime of Bashar al-Assad.",
      "A CBS News team gained access to the site, finding a storeroom lined with hydrochloric acid and acetic acid on an industrial scale, which are precursor chemicals needed to make Captagon, one of the most popular street drugs in the Middle East and beyond.",
      "Ahmed Abu Yakin is with Syria's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, one of the main groups in charge of the country after Assad fled on Dec. 8. Yakin says this massive underground stash of Captagon was found just days after the rebel group's takeover. The pills stuffed into large stacks of household volt regulator kits ready for shipment.",
      "Often referred to as \"poor man's cocaine,\" Captagon is a highly addictive amphetamine-type stimulant.",
      "\"We feel bad for the young people who were addicted to it,\" Yakin said. \"The Assad regime was destroying a generation and couldn't care less. They only cared about making money.\"",
      "And that money is staggering. Analysts estimate the Assad regime raked in $5 billion per year from the trade, dwarfing Syria's official budget and making it a vital lifeline for the bankrupted state. The drug costs just pennies to make but can sell for up to $20 for a single tablet. The haul seen at the abandoned factory is potentially worth tens of millions of dollars.",
      "For years, neighboring countries accused Assad's Syria of being the world's main supplier of the illegal drug. In March 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned several Syrians for their alleged involvement in the \"dangerous amphetamine,\" including two of Assad's cousins.",
      "\"Syria has become a global leader in the production of the highly addictive Captagon, much of which is trafficked through Lebanon,\" said Andrea Gacki at the time, who was then-director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. \"With our allies, we will hold accountable those who support Bashar al-Assad's regime with illicit drug revenue and other financial means that enable the regime's continued repression of the Syrian people.\"",
      "Now, his wildly lucrative drug business appears to have been crushed, along with his brutal and corrupt regime. For Yakin, Captagon has no place in Syria's future.",
      "\"We will destroy it all,\" Yakin said. \"We will eliminate anything that has to do with drugs, and anything that has to do with the criminal Assad regime.\"",

      "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Former Royal Ballet star Sergei Polunin, famous for his tattoos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday announced that he plans to leave Russia. The Ukrainian-Russian dancer was one of the most prominent stars who backed Russia's unilateral 2014 annexation of Crimea and its military assault on Ukraine. He was rewarded with prestigious state posts.",
      "In a rambling, misspelled message on his Instagram account, Polunin wrote: \"My time in Russia ran out a long time ago, it seems at this moment that I have fulfilled my mission here.\"",
      "The post first appeared Sunday on his little-read Telegram account.",
      "Polunin, 35, did not give a specific reason for leaving, but said: \"Thank you for everything that Russia has done for me. The time comes and the soul feels that it's not where it should be.\"",
      "He said he was leaving with his family \u2014 his wife Yelena and three children \u2014 but \"where we will go is not clear so far.\"",
      "In the summer, the dancer complained of a lack of security and said he was being followed.",
      "Polunin, who was born in Ukraine, backed Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea\u00a0 \u2014 a prelude to the ongoing, full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Putin launched in February 2022.",
      "The dancer was granted Russian citizenship in 2019. He was appointed acting head of a dance academy in occupied Crimea's biggest city, Sevastopol, and director of the city's opera and ballet theatre, for which a large new building is under construction.",
      "Just last year he was decorated by Putin for his role in popularizing dance. But in August he was replaced as head of the dance academy by former Bolshoi prima Maria Alexandrova, and a week ago, Russia's arts minister Olga Lyubimova announced his theater director job would go to singer Ildar Abdrazakov.",
      "This came after, on December 9, Polunin published a social media post saying he was \"very sorry for people\" living in the heavily bombarded village near Ukraine's city of Kherson, \"where a generation of Polunins grew up and my Russian grandfather built a small house with his own hands.\"",
      "He urged Putin to negotiate to end the war in Ukraine, saying even \"the worst deal would be better than war.\"",
      "\"I am hoping for Humanity of the president of Russia and if there is a possibility to have a normal professional conversation with Trump,\" Polunin wrote at the time. \"It is better to show willpower and good nature yourself and start negotiations.\"",
      "Aged 13, Polunin won a scholarship to train at the Royal Ballet School in London and became its youngest ever principal dancer.",
      "With his tattoos \u2014 including a large depiction of Putin's face emblazoned prominently on his chest \u2014 and his rebellious attitude, he became known as the \"bad boy of ballet\" and caused a sensation by resigning from the Royal Ballet at the height of his fame in 2012.",
      "Later he made a 2015 hit video to Irish musician Hozier's song \"Take Me to Church\" and was the star of a 2016 documentary called \"Dancer.\"",
      "He moved to perform at Moscow's Stanislavsky Musical Theatre's ballet before launching a solo career, starring in dance performances in roles including the mystic Grigory Rasputin.",
      "In 2019 he posed for AFP with a large tattoo of Putin on his chest which he later supplemented with two Putin faces on either shoulder. He also has a large Ukrainian trident on his right hand.",

      "London \u2014 A court in the United Kingdom ruled Wednesday that police could seize the equivalent of $3.3 million in frozen financial assets from misogynist social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan to cover years of unpaid taxes.",
      "The money has been held in seven bank accounts, frozen by British authorities, belonging to Tate, who previously lived in the U.K., his brother Tristan and a woman identified by the British authorities only as J.",
      "Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring at the Westminster Magistrates' Court said in his Wednesday ruling that transactions made by the brothers, including transfers amounting to almost $12 million to J, had been a \"straightforward cheat\" to evade tax authorities.",
      "Lawyers for the Devon and Cornwall Police force had argued that Tate and his brother were serial tax evaders who paid no taxes on around $26.5 million in revenue from their online businesses.",
      "According to the French news agency AFP, lawyer Sarah Clarke, who represented the police force, quoted during the proceedings  from a video posted online by Tate, in which he said: \"When I lived in England I refused to pay tax.\"",
      "Tate railed against the ruling, accusing the government of \"outright theft.\"",
      "\"This is not justice; it's a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system,\" he said in a statement, claiming the seizure of his assets raised \"serious questions about the lengths authorities will go to silence dissent.\"",

    "summary": "A new Pentagon report says China is continuing to expand its nuclear force and has strengthened its ties with Russia over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "China is continuing its nuclear expansion, is strengthening its ties with Russia, and has increased military pressure against Taiwan over the past year, according to a new Defense Department report that examines actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the U.S.",
      "The report, released Wednesday, also noted that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People's Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing's military growth and could slow its modernization campaign.",
      "A senior defense official said China has made progress in some of its programs but slid back in others.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities.",
      "Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response.",
      "According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China's military power and is required by Congress, By mid-2024, China had over 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the Pentagon expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Pentagon's estimate of China's current stock of nuclear warheads is about 100 higher than disclosed in last year's report, but that is a reflection in the change in the estimate, not the pace of production.",
      "The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels.",
      "That uptick in talks has coincided with a decrease in coercive and risky intercepts of U.S. aircraft since late 2023, compared with the previous two years. China still, however, does what the U.S. military considers \"unsafe\" flights near American and allied forces in the region.",
      "The Pentagon's national defense strategy is built around the assessment that China poses the greatest security challenge for the U.S., and the threat from Beijing influences how the U.S. military is equipped and organized for the future.",
      "Corruption within the PLA has resulted in the ouster of at least 15 high-ranking officials in a major shakeup of China's defense establishment.",
      "\"This wave of corruption touches every service in the PLA, and it may have shaken Beijing's confidence,\" the report said.",
      "In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party and accused of corruption. Last month, another senior official, Miao Hua, was suspended and put under investigation, according to China's Defense Ministry.",
      "The U.S. report points to a persistent increased military presence by China around Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. It said China's navy has been in the region more and that there have been increased crossings into the island's air defense identification zone and major military exercises in the area.",
      "Just last week, a large deployment of Chinese navy and coast guard vessels in the waters around Taiwan triggered alarm as Taiwanese officials said it looked like China was simulating a blockade. Officials have said there were as many as 90 ships involved in what Taiwan described as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China.",
      "Taiwan split from communist China in 1949 and has rejected Beijing's demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary, and leaders have said they want to be ready to do so by 2027.",
      "The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion.",
      "The island democracy has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.",
      "More broadly, the report concluded that the PLA continued its drive to develop greater military capabilities but \"made uneven progress toward its 2027\" milestone for modernization.",
      "One area of expansion, the report said, is with unmanned aerial systems, which officials said are \"quickly approaching U.S. standards.\"",
      "Regarding Russia, the report said China has supported Russia's war against Ukraine and sold Russia dual-use items that Moscow's military industry relies on. Dual use items can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered an inscribed silver amulet that one theologian now says may rewrite the history of Christianity north of the Alps mountain range.",
      "The inscribed amulet was found buried in a grave in Frankfurt, Germany in 2018,\u00a0according to a news release from the city. The amulet is just over an inch in size, the city said, with an inscribed thin silver foil rolled up inside. It took years to determine what the inscription said: It had to be deciphered by a computer scan because the foil was too fragile to unroll. The so-called \"Frankfurt Silver Inscription\" was presented to the public earlier in December.",
      "The inscription was determined to be a statement of faith in Jesus Christ, written in Latin. The statement shows that the wearer \"was clearly a devout Christian, which is absolutely unusual for this time,\" the city said.",
      "Researchers dated the grave where the amulet was found to between 230 and 270 AD. This is the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, the city said: All other finds are several decades younger, with \"reliable evidence\" of the religion in the region dating back to the 4th century.",
      "The inscription mentions no religion besides Christianity, which researchers said is unusual. Up until the 5th century, these kind of amulets \"always contain a mixture of different faiths,\" such as Judaism or paganism. Instead, it is entirely based on Christianity. At one point the invocation \"Holy, holy, holy!\" is present. Researchers previously had dated that invocation no earlier than the 4th century. The amulet also included quotations from the Bible used by Christians at that time.",
      "\"The 'Frankfurt Inscription' is a scientific sensation,\" city mayor Mike Josef said in a translated statement. \"It will force us to turn back the history of Christianity in Frankfurt and far beyond by around 50 to 100 years. The first Christian find north of the Alps comes from our city: we can be proud of that, especially now, so close to Christmas. Those involved have done a great job.\"",
      "Researchers said that this find will lead to a reevaluation of the burial ground where the amulet was uncovered. It will also lead to a revision of ideas about Christianity north of the Alps.",
      "German church historian Ulrich Volp told the Evangelical Press Service that the amulet can be used to help understand how Christianity spread through the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, even amid persecution.",
      "\"The significance of the discovery can hardly be overestimated,\" Volp said.",
      "The news comes about six months after a experts in Germany said a newly deciphered manuscript dating back 1,600 years was determined to be the oldest record of Jesus Christ's childhood.",

    "story": [
      "An improvised land mine apparently planted by a drug cartel killed two Mexican soldiers and wounded five others, Mexico's defense secretary said Tuesday. Before the blast, the soldiers had discovered the dismembered bodies of three people, officials said.",
      "Gen. Ricardo Trevilla acknowledged that the army had already suffered six deaths from such improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, between 2018 and 2024. But he didn't specify whether those six had been killed by bombs dropped from drones, or by buried roadside bombs, both of which have been used by gangs in Mexico.",
      "Trevilla said that devices like the one that exploded Monday were \"very rustic,\" and officials in the past have described them as similar to buried pipe bombs. There was no immediate information on the condition of the five wounded in the attack, which included at least one officer.",
      "Trevilla's description of the location where the two soldiers died Monday in the western state of Michoacan\u00a0suggested that it may have been a sort of grisly drug cartel booby trap.",
      "Trevilla said the army sent out a patrol to check on reports that there was an encampment of armed men in a rural area. The armed forces detected an area protected by stockades that appeared to be an encampment, but when soldiers approached in vehicles, they found the trail blocked by logs, so they descended and had to approach on foot.",
      "While approaching, they spotted three dismembered bodies near the encampment, which appeared to be abandoned. But as they drew closer, a buried device exploded and struck the soldiers.",
      "Trevilla blamed the blast on the United Cartels, an umbrella group that includes the local Viagras gang, which has been fighting bloody turf battles against the Jalisco cartel in Michoacan for years.",
      "In August, the Mexican army acknowledged that some of its soldiers have been killed by bomb-dropping drones operated by drug cartels.",
      "Previously, officials have said the army encounters far more roadside bombs than drone-dropped ones.",
      "The Jalisco drug cartel\u00a0has been fighting local gangs for control of Michoacan for years, and the situation has become so militarized that the warring cartels use roadside bombs or IEDs, trenches, pillbox fortifications, homemade armored vehicles and sniper rifles.",
      "Nemesio Oseguera-Cervantes, also known as \"El Mencho,\" the leader of the Jalisco cartel, which the officials described as \"one of the world's most violent and prolific drug trafficking organizations.\" The United States and the State Department has offered a\u00a0$10 million reward\u00a0for his capture.",
      "In the only previous detailed report on cartel bomb attacks in August 2023, the defense department said at that time that a total of 42 soldiers, police and suspects were wounded by IEDs in the first seven and a half months of 2023, up from 16 in all of 2022.",

      "Doctors put a scope through Williams-Paisley\u2019s nose and down her throat in order to examine her vocal cords. However, the medical team said that \"the muscles in her neck were so tight that the cords were barely visible,\" she described to People magazine in an exclusive interview.",

      "According to People, \"during the procedure, the team took an implant made of silicone rubber and put it next to her left vocal cord to hold it in place, then asked her to speak. They removed it, adjusted the size by hand-carving it, replaced it and had her try again. When her voice was back to its natural tone, they knew it fit perfectly. And once in place, the implant \u2014 which is permanent and should last a lifetime \u2014 allowed her to speak out loud again for the first time in nearly two years.\"",
      "\"I couldn\u2019t believe it was true,\" Williams-Paisley said. \"It felt great.\"",

      "The cycle of losing and regaining weight on repeat, commonly known as the yo-yo effect, could be due to a type of \"metabolic memory,\" a new study found. (iStock)",
      "The new research, published in November in the journal Nature, points to epigenetics (genetic activity) that may play a role in regaining weight after weight loss.",
      "What is epigenetics?",
      "\"Epigenetics, which involves chemical markers that influence gene activity without altering the DNA sequence, is crucial in how cells function and respond to environmental factors,\" Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School,\u00a0told Fox News Digital.",

      "It is well-known that cells keep their genetic identity as they divide. The researchers were curious about what happens to fat cells \u2014 which live on average for 10 years before the body replaces them, von Meyenn said.",
      "The researchers investigated what happens to fat cells, which live on average for 10 years before the body replaces them. (iStock)",
      "This differs from other cells in tissues, which divide much faster \u2013 intestinal cells, for example, generally divide every other week, he added.",
      "Fat cells still must adapt to external stimuli and undergo epigenetic adaptations, von Meyenn noted.",
      "The researchers set out to determine whether these changes could be reversed.",
      "Fighting \u2018memory\u2019 in fat cells",
      "In mouse studies, the researchers found that even after significant weight loss, their cells have a \"memory\" of obesity encoded in the epigenome, which controls the activity of genes, said von Meyenn.",
      "\"Our study indicates that one reason maintaining body weight after initial weight loss is difficult is that the fat cells remember their prior obese state and likely aim to return to this state,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The body tends to defend increased body weight, making weight loss and maintenance notoriously challenging.\"",
      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",
      "Other experts cautioned, however, that the study shows only association and does not prove that epigenetic changes cause the yo-yo effect.",
      "CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEXT MEAL? IT'S CALLED FOOD NOISE, HERE'S WHAT TO DO",
      "\"The authors pointed out that they cannot say for certain that the epigenetic modifications directly cause people to regain their lost weight, nor pinpoint which specific epigenetic markers may be driving this effect,\" Petronella Ravenshear, board-certified nutritionist and author of \"The Human Being Diet,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "Florida-based Ravenshear, who was not part of the study, noted that the results should not lead people to claim, \"It\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s my genes!\"",
      "Plans for future research",
      "\"We will need to now expand, see how the memory can be erased and whether other cells or tissues are also affected, [such as] the brain or the liver,\" von Meyenn said.",
      "It\u2019s possible that if people maintain a healthy weight for a year or longer after dieting, that may be enough time to erase the memory in fat cells, according to Ravenshear.",
      "The term \"diet,\" in its original connotation, means \"way of living\" \u2014 but it is now synonymous with short-term dietary changes that are unsustainable, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"This discovery underscores the importance of preventing obesity, particularly in children and adolescents, to avoid establishing this epigenetic memory that complicates long-term weight management,\" Stanford noted.",

      "\"I have slipped and called people \u2018honey, \u2019sweetheart' and \u2018darling.\u2019 I mean it to be endearing, but women found it dated and offensive,\" Cuomo said at the time. \"I take full responsibility for my actions. I have been too familiar with people. My sense of humor can be insensitive and off-putting.\"",
      "\"In my mind, I've never crossed the line with anyone, but I didn't realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn,\" he added. \"There are generational and cultural shifts that I just didn't fully appreciate. And I should have, no excuses.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "An inventor designed rooftop solar panels for a Tesla that draws solar energy while the car is parked, adding travel mileage without plugging in.",
    "story": [
      "An inventor designed rooftop solar panels for his Tesla Model Y.",
      "Have you ever wondered how we could make our cars even greener?",
      "Well, meet Omid Sadeghpour, a forward-thinking inventor with a brilliant idea. He\u2019s designed rooftop solar panels specifically for his Tesla Model Y.",
      "His project, DartSolar, harnesses solar energy while the car is parked, potentially adding up to 20 extra miles of driving range each day without ever needing to plug in. As he gets ready to roll out the next iteration, Beta2, let\u2019s explore what makes this innovation so groundbreaking.",

      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "The concept behind DartSolar",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) often spend significant time parked in open spaces, making them ideal candidates for solar energy collection. Sadeghpour's vision is simple yet effective: why not utilize the sun's energy to charge EVs while they are stationary? This concept forms the foundation of the DartSolar project.",
      "DartSolar isn\u2019t just about innovation; it\u2019s also about practicality. Imagine a rooftop solar panel that\u2019s aerodynamic, weatherproof, theft-resistant and easy to use. It opens in just 10 seconds with the same effort required to open your car door. These panels are tough, too, built to withstand wind, rain, sand and snow, ensuring reliable performance in all conditions.",
      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW FAR VOLVO'S NEW ELECTRIC SEMI-TRUCK GOES ON A SINGLE CHARGE",
      "The beta 1 prototype",
      "Omid Sadeghpour's initial prototype, known as Beta 1, was built in collaboration with Jeran Bruce at California's Forged Makerspace. This prototype is designed with nine flexible solar panels, each rated at 175 watts, which can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. The structure is made from wood and features telescoping carbon-fiber tubes that allow for easy expansion and retraction.",
      "Weighing in at under 165 pounds, Beta 1 remains within the roof weight capacity of the Tesla Model Y and is designed to fit within a standard U.S. parking space when fully expanded.",
      "When fully deployed, Beta 1 can generate approximately 6 kWh of power per day, which translates to about 20 miles of additional driving range. When it\u2019s time to drive again, the system can be collapsed into a compact rooftop box in under a minute.",
      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Advancements with beta 2",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about the future. Beta 2, the fifth iteration of DartSolar, takes innovation to the next level. This version swaps the wood structure for carbon fiber, cutting its height in half for better aerodynamics. The wattage capacity has also been boosted to a potential 4,000 watts, providing up to 45 miles of range per day under optimal conditions.",
      "Here\u2019s where things get exciting: Beta 2 introduces dynamic charging capabilities. This means the panels can charge the car while driving or in different configurations, like partially opened for better airflow or fully closed during high-speed travel. With a reduced drag loss of just 1%-2%, it\u2019s as efficient on the road as it is when parked.",

      "The DartSolar system has the potential to serve multiple practical applications. First, it provides a viable charging solution for those venturing into remote areas where charging stations are scarce. Additionally, it acts as a backup energy source during power outages, allowing electric vehicles to remain operational even when traditional charging methods are unavailable.",
      "Although the project is currently a DIY initiative and not yet ready for commercial release, Sadeghpour plans to share blueprints and build files on the DartSolar website. This move aims to encourage others to explore similar innovations in solar technology.",

As advancements continue with the Beta 2 prototype, Sadeghpour's work has the potential to revolutionize electric vehicle charging and drive sustainability forward.

      "Scammers have become skilled at creating convincing fake websites.",
      "Online financial scams have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting unsuspecting individuals through various deceptive techniques. Cybercriminals exploit trust and create convincing scenarios to steal personal and financial information, often using well-known platforms like PayPal as their hunting ground.",
      "Take Paul from Massachusetts, for example. He recently wrote to us about his disturbing experience. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of online financial transactions. Here's his account in his own words.",
      "\"I wanted to sign up for PayPal and used Google to get the website. After the 'website' popped up, it asked me for the usual name, address, etc. and my credit card number with the expiration and 3-digit code. Almost immediately, I received a flash message from my credit card company asking if I made a purchase at a company in OKLA. I live in MA and had the card in my lap. The information was stolen, and a purchase was made almost immediately.",

      "Key takeaways from Paul's experience",
      "Paul's unfortunate encounter with online fraud offers several important lessons. First, scammers have become adept at creating highly convincing fake websites that can easily fool unsuspecting users. These sites often mimic legitimate platforms down to the smallest details, making it crucial to verify the authenticity of any site requesting personal information.",
      "Second, fraudulent transactions can occur with alarming speed once scammers obtain sensitive data. In Paul's case, the thieves attempted to make purchases within minutes of acquiring his credit card information.",
      "Third, credit card companies have developed sophisticated systems to detect suspicious activity rapidly, which can help mitigate potential losses. Paul's credit card company quickly alerted him to the unauthorized transaction and took swift action to prevent further fraud.",
      "Lastly, this incident underscores the critical importance of digital vigilance and careful online navigation. Always take the time to verify the authenticity of websites before entering any personal or financial information, especially when dealing with financial services or online payments.",

      "How to protect yourself from online financial scams",
      "Protecting your financial information online is crucial. Here are some important steps you can take to safeguard yourself against cyber threats:",
      "Verify the website's authenticity: Before entering any personal information online, always double-check the URL of the website you're visiting. Look for \"https://\" at the beginning of the address and a padlock icon in the address bar, which indicates a secure connection. To ensure you're on the correct site, type the web address directly into your browser instead of relying on search engine results or clicking on links from emails.",
      "Be wary of unsolicited communications:\u00a0Legitimate companies will never send unsolicited emails asking for sensitive information. Avoid clicking on links in emails claiming to be from financial institutions, as these could be phishing attempts. Hover over the links to see the actual URL before clicking, as this can help you identify suspicious or misleading addresses. If you're unsure about a communication, log in to your account directly through the official website or app to check for any notifications or requests.",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Use strong authentication methods:\u00a0Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your financial accounts to add an extra layer of security. Create unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts, avoiding the temptation to reuse passwords across multiple sites. Consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords securely.",
      "Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Make it a habit to check your financial accounts frequently for any unauthorized activities or suspicious transactions. Set up alerts for transactions on your credit cards and online payment accounts so you can be immediately notified of any activity on your accounts.",
      "Be cautious with personal information: Never share your passwords or answers to security questions with anyone, no matter how trustworthy they may seem. Be skeptical of any requests for personal information, especially those that create a sense of urgency. Legitimate organizations will not pressure you to provide sensitive data immediately.",
      "Use secure payment methods: When making purchases from unknown sellers, use protected payment options that offer buyer protection. Consider using credit cards for online purchases, as they often provide better fraud protection than debit cards. If a website offers multiple payment options, choose the most secure method available.",
      "Use caution with public Wi-Fi: Avoid using\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks for financial transactions, as these can be easily compromised. If you must access financial accounts while away from home, use a secure VPN connection to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\u00a0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "When you visit a webpage, you might see a CAPTCHA to make sure you\u2019re a real person and not a bot. These usually involve jumbled words, some recognizable images or just a box that says, \"I am not a robot.\"",
      "CAPTCHAs are harmless, but hackers are now using them to infect your PC with malware.",
      "Security researchers have found a huge fake CAPTCHA campaign spreading the dangerous Lumma info-stealer malware, which can bypass security measures like Safe Browsing.",
      "This campaign shows how malvertising works, with more than a million ad impressions every day and thousands of victims losing their accounts and money through a network of more than 3,000 sites.

      "Illustration of a scammer (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does the scam work?",
      "As reported\u00a0by Guardio, the fake CAPTCHA scam is a sophisticated malvertising campaign that lures you into unknowingly installing malware under the guise of routine CAPTCHA verification. The cyberattack starts when you\u2019re browsing websites, often those offering free streaming, downloads or pirated content. These sites are used by hackers to present you with what appears to be a legitimate CAPTCHA verification page.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The page mimics a real CAPTCHA, asking you to confirm you are human. However, the instructions are designed to trick you into initiating harmful actions, like triggering the Windows \"Run\" dialog. Users unknowingly paste and execute a crafted PowerShell command, which silently installs the Lumma info-stealer malware onto their system.",
      "The malware targets sensitive data, including social media accounts, banking credentials, saved passwords and personal files, potentially leading to financial and identity theft.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "Who\u2019s to blame for this?",
      "The fake CAPTCHA scam shows how messy the internet\u2019s ad system has become, with everyone involved passing the buck. Guardio Labs points to ad networks like Monetag as a big part of the problem. They distribute malicious ads that are disguised during moderation using tricks like cloaking. Publishers, especially those offering free or pirated content, add to the issue by running these shady ads on their sites, often without checking what they\u2019re actually showing users.",
      "Then there are services like BeMob, which lets scammers hide their bad links behind harmless-looking URLs. These companies call themselves analytics tools, but they\u2019re helping the scams stay hidden. Hosting providers don\u2019t escape blame either. They\u2019re where these fake CAPTCHA pages live, and they often don\u2019t bother to check what\u2019s being hosted.",
      "Of course, the scammers themselves are the ones pulling the strings. But because they spread their operations across so many platforms, they\u2019re almost impossible to track down. Guardio\u2019s research shows how all these moving parts work together, creating a system where no one takes responsibility, and the scams keep running.",

      "1. Use reliable security software:\u00a0Keeping your antivirus and anti-malware software up to date is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from fake CAPTCHA scams.

      "2. Enable browser protection features:\u00a0Modern browsers offer built-in security features, such as Safe Browsing and phishing protection, which warn you about potentially dangerous sites. Make sure these features are enabled in your browser settings. These tools can alert you to malicious links or fake CAPTCHAs trying to trick you into downloading malware.",
      "3. Be cautious with \"free\" content:\u00a0There\u2019s a saying that goes, \"If something is free, you\u2019re what they are selling.\" Websites that offer free downloads, streaming services or pirated content are often associated with malvertising campaigns. Fake CAPTCHA scams are commonly spread through these types of sites, where users are tricked into clicking on malicious ads or links. Even if a site seems tempting, it\u2019s important to be cautious. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or using \"free\" services, as they could be traps designed to infect your device with malware.",
      "4. Avoid clicking on suspicious ads:\u00a0Always be wary of ads that appear out of nowhere or seem too good to be true. Fake CAPTCHA scams often disguise themselves as legitimate ads, asking you to click to verify you're human. Never interact with pop-up ads or unfamiliar banners, especially those that claim to give you something for free, as they may lead to malicious pages or trigger malware downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Check for HTTPS and look for signs of a legitimate site:\u00a0Before entering any personal information or interacting with a CAPTCHA, ensure that the website is secure. Look for \"https://\" in the website\u2019s URL, which indicates the connection is encrypted. Legitimate websites also tend to have a professional appearance, so if something feels off or the design looks poor, trust your instincts and leave the site.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to access your accounts.",

      "There\u2019s no question that fake CAPTCHA scams are a growing threat, putting millions of us at risk of malware infections and financial loss. What\u2019s even more concerning is that ad networks, publishers and hosting services continue to allow malicious campaigns to spread through their platforms despite the widespread awareness of the problem. The companies involved must take immediate action to improve content moderation, tighten security measures and prevent these scams from thriving.

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "5. Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats.

Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6. Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7. Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it's crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "The holiday season is the best time of the year. Many of us spend quality time with our families, enjoy delicious food and even go on vacations. For many, it\u2019s also a time to indulge in shopping. And why not? This is when you find the best deals on your favorite products, whether it\u2019s a new electronic gadget or a household essential.",
      "However, the holiday season also comes with an increased risk of mobile fraud while shopping online. Scammers often target online shoppers in more ways than you might imagine. Fortunately, with some awareness and precautions, you can protect yourself. Below, I\u2019ll discuss the rise in mobile shopping scams and how you can stay safe.",

      "A woman shopping on her smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise in mobile fraud",
      "According to\u00a0Appdome's latest U.S. Consumer Survey, 60.6% of Americans say fraud is their biggest concern. More than 40% of global consumers reported that they or someone close to them had been directly affected by mobile fraud, malware or a cyberattack. With mobile apps now being the main way people interact with brands, skepticism among users is growing. In fact, 24% of consumers believe developers don\u2019t care about app security, a massive jump of 258% since 2021.",
      "Social engineering has become a major worry, as people are becoming more aware of the many ways mobile fraud can happen. This includes things like location spoofing, scams that manipulate users and account takeovers. Almost half of the survey respondents this year said they or someone they know personally had dealt with fraud, scams or similar issues.",
      "Such scams also affect your online shopping experience. I spoke with Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome, regarding what consumers need to know when they are shopping on their mobile devices this holiday season.",
      "\"Consumers should be aware of phishing, smishing and vishing scams, which exploit fake emails, deceptive SMS messages and fraudulent phone calls to steal sensitive information. More sophisticated threats include FaceID bypass attacks, such as those carried out by the GoldPickaxe malware, which uses AI-enhanced techniques to bypass biometric authentication,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "\"Other significant risks include banking trojans, which infiltrate apps to steal login credentials or financial data, and accessibility malware, which exploits device accessibility features to take control of mobile interactions. The rise of these sophisticated threats highlights the need for robust in-app security.\"",

      "Shopping scams are becoming harder to detect, but it\u2019s easy to stay ahead of them. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself while shopping on your phone.",
      "This might seem obvious, but sticking to trusted apps can help keep you safe while shopping. By trusted apps, I mean platforms like Amazon, eBay and Walmart.",
      "\"With the growing sophistication of mobile threats, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to identify risks independently. Threats like phishing, accessibility malware and banking trojans are designed to mimic legitimate functions, making them nearly impossible to detect at a glance. Instead of relying solely on spotting issues, consumers should look for apps that clearly communicate their commitment to security through visible privacy policies, transparent security practices and updates addressing new threats. Choosing apps from trusted sources and reading user reviews can also provide reassurance,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "When shopping on your phone, be cautious of\u00a0phishing, smishing and\u00a0vishing scams, as they are common tactics used to steal your personal and financial information. Phishing involves fake emails that look like they are from trusted retailers, tricking you into sharing sensitive details like passwords or payment information. Smishing is a similar tactic but delivered through text messages, often containing links to fake websites or malicious downloads.",
      "Vishing, on the other hand, involves scammers making phone calls pretending to be customer service representatives from well-known brands, attempting to gain access to your private information. Always verify the authenticity of emails, texts or calls before clicking links or sharing details to ensure a safe shopping experience.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "When shopping online on your phone, it's important to be careful about the permissions you give to apps. A lot of apps may ask for access to things like your camera, contacts or location, even if it's not necessary for the shopping experience. Always think twice before granting these permissions.",
      "\"These permissions are often abused by malware to collect sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Before granting permissions, consider whether they align with the app\u2019s purpose. Developers can mitigate these risks by incorporating protections from Appdome\u2019s anti-fraud offering, which protects against the many abuse methods used by malicious actors to abuse mobile app permissions,\" Tovar said.",
      "A woman shopping on her smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Protecting financial information is crucial, especially when shopping online. It's important to use secure websites, indicated by \"https\" in the URL, and avoid saving payment details in apps or on websites unless they are trustworthy.",
      "While consumers should stay vigilant \u2013 by using trusted apps, downloading only from official app stores and monitoring for suspicious activity \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, Tovar said.",
      "\"The sophistication of modern threats often makes it impossible for users to identify or prevent all risks on their own,\" he said. \"Consumers have a better chance of keeping their personal information secure by choosing brands that prioritize security and back it up with tangible actions, such as automating robust protections and delivering proactive, built-in security measures.\"",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The holiday season is a prime time for shopping and, unfortunately, for scams. As mobile shopping continues to grow, threats like AI-driven scams and advanced malware are expected to increase. However, you can keep yourself safe by staying informed about potential threats, choosing apps with robust security measures and practicing good mobile hygiene. It's also the responsibility of app developers to ensure users don\u2019t fall prey to scammers.",

Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities.

Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization.

They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",

      "THE BEST WAY TO BUY GIFT CARDS EVER",
      "5) Home Depot email confirmation scam",
      "Scammers are capitalizing on the festive spirit with a deceptive email campaign targeting people at this time of year.\u00a0This scam involves a deceptive email that appears to be from Home Depot with such wording as \"Confirmation needed: please confirm receipt.\" The email body typically contains enticing text like \"Congratulations! The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",
      "Fake Home Depot winning email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6) Fake online shopping sites scam",
      "One of the most common scams during the holiday season is the fake online shopping site scam. Scammers create websites that look like legitimate online stores but are actually designed to steal your personal and financial information. They may offer products at very low prices or claim to have limited-time deals or exclusive items. They may also send you\u00a0phishing emails or text messages with links to these fake sites.",
      "A woman shopping on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The website address does not match the name of the store or brand.The website has poor design and/or spelling and grammar errors.The website does not have a secure connection\u00a0(https) or a padlock icon in the address bar.The website asks for too much personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details.The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",

      "The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",
      "How to avoid falling victim to this scam",
      "By following a few simple precautions, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling prey to online scams and ensure a safer shopping experience.",
      "1) Shop only from trusted and reputable online stores that you know and have used before.",
      "2) Check the website address carefully and look for any red flags.",
      "3) Do some research on the online store before making a purchase. Read customer reviews, look for ratings or search for complaints online.",
      "4) Use a credit card or a secure payment service like PayPal when shopping online. Do not use debit cards, wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "5) Keep track of your online purchases and monitor your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus protection software. An effective antivirus software is a must-have. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links on fake websites or in phishing emails and text messages is to have\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices.\u00a0It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service. Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1) If you can regain control of your accounts, change your passwords and inform the account provider",
      "2) Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started",
      "3)\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4)\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5) Get the professional advice of a lawyer",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theftIf being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft",
      "If being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "6)\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7) Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",

      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Smart solutions for festive security",
      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

      "Apple AirTags: An alternative approach",
      "For those considering a switch to\u00a0Apple, AirTags present another viable option. Karen asked if she would have problems tracking her decorations with an Apple AirTag. While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

The SmartTag uses Bluetooth for nearby tracking and relies on other Samsung devices for long-range location. Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",
      "For Samsung users like Karen, the\u00a0SmartTag is the natural choice, working seamlessly with Galaxy devices. Those considering Apple might look at the\u00a0AirTag\u00a0as an option.",
      "Please note that while these tags can help you track your items, they might not prevent theft as they are not hidden devices and can be removed by someone who recognizes what they are.",

      "10 THINGS YOU MUST CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING ANY SECURITY CAMERA",
      "1. Use motion-activated cameras: Install\u00a0motion-activated security cameras to monitor your decorations. Many security cameras send real-time notifications to your phone, allowing you to act quickly if someone tampers with your property.",
      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

      "The numbers back up the growing threat. The FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center received nearly 56,000 reports of personal data breaches last year.

Knowing what steps to take \u2014 and in what order \u2014 can make a huge difference in regaining control and stopping the damage.

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "The New York Post was first to report on the Bronx bust with the publication reporting that seven suspected members of TdA \u2013 which has been terrorizing cities across the nation following \u2013 were arrested inside the apartment building and were sought on multiple warrants after crossing the US border with Mexico.",
      "The raid on the Bronx five-story apartment building, which is located next to the Do\u00f1a Juana Day Care facility, took place on Dec. 5 and was carried out by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the NYPD's federal task force, a law enforcement source tells Fox News.

The gang has been engaged in all sorts of violent crime, including murders, shootings of police officers, assaults, robberies and gun smuggling into migrant shelters.",
      "The alleged gangbangers were traced to the Bronx apartment after tracking the ankle monitor of suspected TdA member Jarwin Valero-Calderon to the hideout on the edge of Crotona Park, sources told The Post. Crotona Park is where President-elect Trump held a campaign rally in May.",

      "According to the Post, Valero-Calderon entered the U.S. at Eagle Pass, Texas, in August 2022 and was released with a court date. In the meantime, he racked up a long rap sheet in multiple states before being ordered deported in April but was still on the loose on Dec. 5, the Post reports, citing sources.",

      "\"This is a gang that set up camp in our city, and it is beyond the pale that the Democratic Party is entrenched against having the NYPD cooperate with ICE to remove them,\" Borelli told Fox News Digital. \"They are actively recruiting members among the migrant community and unfortunately, spend most of their time terrorizing those very same people.\"",
      "\"Mayor Adams should use every resource available to end the city law that precludes the NYPD from cooperating with ICE because it is specific groups like this that make me question the sanity of people who seek to protect them and ensure they remain here.\"",
      "Those comments were echoed by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y. who told \"Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street\" that Democrats have been weakening laws to allow for illegal immigrants, gangs and criminal organizations to stay within New York and \"wreak havoc.\"",

      "According to information obtained by sources embedded in the Iranian regime and supplied to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition organization based out of D.C. and Paris, there are indications that Tehran has once again renewed efforts to advance its ability to detonate a nuclear weapon.",
      "At the head of Iran\u2019s detonators program is an organization the NCRI has dubbed METFAZ, which is the Farsi acronym for the Center for Research and Expansion of Technologies on Explosions and Impact, and its recent movements at a previously deactivated site, known as Sanjarian, has drawn immense speculation.",
      "The Foundation for Defense of Democracies has analyzed where Iran's nuclear infrastructure is located. (Foundation for Defense of Democracies)",
      "IRAN HIDING MISSILE, DRONE PROGRAMS UNDER GUISE OF COMMERCIAL FRONT TO EVADE SANCTIONS",
      "\"Our information shows the METFAZ has expanded its activities, intensified activities, and their main focus is basically the detonation of the nuclear bomb,\" Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI in the U.S., told Fox News Digital. \"When you make a bomb, you have the fissile material at the center of it, but you need to be able to trigger it, to detonate it, and that\u2019s a sophisticated process.",
      "\"It\u2019s important to see what METFAZ does and follow their activities because that is sort of like a gauge on figuring out where the whole nuclear weapons program is,\" he added.",
      "Iran has at least a dozen sites across the country dedicated to nuclear development, weaponization, research and heavy water production, but information shared with Fox News Digital suggests that there has been an increase in covert activity in at least two of these locations, including Sanjarian, which was once one of Iran\u2019s top weaponization facilities.",
      "The Sanjarian site, located roughly 25 miles east of Tehran and once central to Iran\u2019s nuclear program under what is known as the Amad Plan, was believed to have been largely inactive between 2009 and late 2020 after stiff international pushback on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",

      "METFAZ falls under Iran\u2019s Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is widely known to security experts as the organization spearheading Iran\u2019s nuclear development and is suspected of using the Sanjarian site for renewed research on exoloding bridgewire (EWB) detonators.",
      "Iran has previously attempted to conceal its EBW detonators program, a system first invented in the 1940s to deploy atomic warheads but which has expanded into non-military sectors, under activities relating to the oil industry.",
      "In a 2015 report, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), noted that Iran\u2019s detonator development was an \"integral part of a program to develop an implosion-type nuclear explosive device.\"",
      "It also highlighted how Iran attempted to conceal its program by alleging during a May 20, 2014, meeting that the detonator program dating back to 2000-2003 was related to Tehran\u2019s aerospace industry and was needed to \"help prevent explosive accidents\" but which the IAEA determined was \"inconsistent with the timeframe and unrelated to the detonator development program.\"",

      "\"The Iranian regime has really basically, over the years, used deceptive tactics \u2013 lies, stalling, playing games, dragging [their feet], wasting time,\" Jafarzadeh said when asked about this report. \"That\u2019s the way they\u2019re dealing with the IAEA, with the goal of moving their own nuclear weapons program forward without being accountable for anything.\"",
      "The IAEA did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions on the NCRI\u2019s most recent findings, which were shared with the nuclear watchdog this week, and it remains unclear what advancements or research Iran continues to pursue in the detonator field.",

      "The NCRI also found that METFAZ, which operates out of a military site known as Parchin some 30 miles southeast of Tehran, has expanded its Plan 6 complex where it conducts explosive tests and production.",
      "Parchin, which is made up of several military industrial complexes, was targeted in Israel\u2019s October 2024 strikes.

      "\"The regime has used deceptive tactics to prevent any mechanism for verification, and it has yet to provide an opportunity or the means for the IAEA to have a satisfactory answer to the inquiries it has raised,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Our revelation today shows that the regime has no transparency related to its program for building an atomic bomb and is moving towards building the bomb at a rapid pace.\"",

      "\"Since October 7th, there has been an increased push\u00a0from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, with significant Iranian involvement,\" said Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Forum for Palestinian Studies at Tel Aviv University who further emphasized the shift in the situation since Oct. 7, noting the influence of Iranian-backed forces. \"They're trying to push operations in the West Bank, and there have been attempts to manufacture rockets and fire them at Israeli cities\u00a0from Jenin. While it\u2019s still in the early stages and these efforts are unsuccessful, it\u2019s a troubling development that signals how Jenin is evolving into a central hub for terrorists.\"",

The deaths have further fueled the discontent in the city, particularly among residents of the Jenin refugee camp. \"The entire refugee camp is now against the PA,\" said Daraghmeh.",
      "On Sunday, reports surfaced that the PA had positioned its forces outside the refugee camp, but attempts to enter were met with resistance.

      "The timing of the PA\u2019s operation is significant, with many observers noting that it coincides with the broader regional context, including the ongoing war in Gaza and the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Milshtein believes that the events in Syria played a role in the PA\u2019s decision to act. \"People in the West Bank say that when one dictator (PA President Mahmoud Abbas) saw what happened to the other (Bashar al-Assad), he decided he would not follow the same fate,\" Milshtein explained. \"Mahmoud Abbas likely felt that he needed to act before the PA\u2019s authority in the West Bank completely erodes.\"",
      "The operation, which is part of a larger crackdown in the northern West Bank, also reflects the PA\u2019s desire to assert itself as a capable authority ahead of potential political developments in Gaza. The PA has long struggled with its ability to govern Gaza, which it lost to Hamas in 2007. Now, with the region in turmoil, it is hoping to prove that it can restore order in the West Bank, which it argues will bolster its legitimacy in any postwar political scenario for Gaza.",

Giving the PA two hours in Gaza is a known failure from the outset.\"",
      "Despite the violence in Jenin, Daraghmeh does not foresee the conflict spreading beyond. \"People in Ramallah, Hebron and other cities don\u2019t want the West Bank to turn into another Gaza,\" Daraghmeh said. \"The situation in Jenin is contained, but it remains a test for the PA\u2019s ability to control its own territory.\"",

      "This sphere of influence is obtained by skirting federal policies and instead focusing on relation-building at the state and local levels, whether this is through private contracts, state-based programs, or acquisitions and investments that create jobs and boost local economies.",
      "\"State and local governments are more \u2018pragmatic\u2019 than their federal counterparts, focused on \u2018employment and economic development\u2019 rather than security concerns,\" the authors said in reference to a 2019 report by the state-owned news agency Xinhua that reviewed local U.S. government relationships with China despite the ongoing trade war ignited one year earlier under the then-Trump administration.",

      "However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the agreement void, arguing it no longer applied after forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad abandoned their positions on the Syrian side during the country\u2019s civil war.

Despite strong public support for Ukraine, Israel\u2019s government has maintained a cautious approach, largely due to its complex relationship with Moscow.

      "These are just a few of the countless stories documented in a new report released on Tuesday, co-authored by Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy, founder of the Civil Commission on October 7th Crimes Against Women and Children, and Dr. Michal Gilad and Dr. Ilya Rudyak. The report introduces the term \"kinocide\" to describe the systematic targeting and destruction of family units during the attack-\u00a0an unprecedented atrocity that goes beyond typical warfare.",
      "\"A crime without a name for victims without a voice,\" as Dr. Elkayam-Levy described it. \"The perpetrators not only killed but deliberately sought to destroy the very foundation of human society: the family.\"",
      "\"The hardest crimes to witness were those involving families,\" Dr. Elkayam-Levy continued, \"While the Hamas perpetrators celebrated their violence, chanting religious slogans and broadcasting their actions on social media, the terror was not confined to the immediate victims-it was amplified globally.\"",
      "\"The use of social media was crucial in spreading the terror, inspiring similar acts of violence elsewhere,\" Merav Israeli-Amarant, CEO of the Civil Commission, told Fox News Digital. She referred to this tactic as the \"terror theater\" a term coined by legal scholar Tehila Schwartz Altshuler, explaining how the broadcasts were designed to radicalize and incite other terrorists.",

      "As Elkayam-Levy and her team dug deeper, they realized that similar tactics have been documented in conflicts across the globe, from Argentina and Iraq to Syria, Sierra Leone and Myanmar. \"We\u2019ve been in contact with survivors of kinocide, including Yazidis, who have shared their experiences. The pain is universal. This has happened before, but it never had a name,\" Dr. Elkayam-Levy said.",
      "In collaboration with the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, the commission worked to identify these patterns of abuse and ensure that kinocide is recognized as a distinct crime. The new report, released after a year of research, includes interviews with survivors, visits to the sites where the atrocities took place, and an extensive review of evidence. The goal is to bring kinocide into international legal discourse, advocating for its urgent need to be recognized as a distinct crime.",

      "Professor Irwin Cotler, former Minister of Justice of Canada and International Chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights, stated, \"Silence in the face of such evil is not neutrality; it is complicity. Worse still, there has been denial, justification, and even the glorification of these heinous acts, underscoring the moral and legal imperative to act decisively against such crimes. The dangers of antisemitism are not just the oldest and most lethal of hatreds- they are also a presage of global evil, as evidenced by the events of October 7.\"",
      "\"We need an international coalition to address this systematic targeting of families,\" Elkayam-Levy said. \"But international law has failed the survivors of October 7. The current legal frameworks do not adequately protect families in these kinds of attacks.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 20:11:23 GMT",
    "summary": "House Republicans will try to pass another plan to avoid a government shutdown this weekend, but they'll need Democrats and possibly Donald Trump's support.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders on Friday are pressing forward with a new plan to try to avert a government shutdown hours ahead of a deadline that would force U.S. troops, border patrol agents, air traffic controllers and millions of other federal workers to work without pay during the holidays.",
      "Just three days ago, bipartisan House and Senate leaders struck an agreement to keep the government\u2019s lights on, but President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire confidant Elon Musk killed the deal, insisting at the 11th hour it needed to extend or abolish the debt limit to make way for Trump's agenda next year.",
      "Follow along for live updates",
      "A backup plan \u2014 endorsed by Trump and Musk \u2014 then went down in flames on the House floor, tanked by Democrats as well as 38 Republicans who objected to the debt extension.",
      "Embattled Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who is fighting to keep his leadership job, is now moving forward with Plan C: Passing a single package \u2014 funding the government through March 14, disaster aid and a farm bill \u2014 while stripping out Trump's debt limit extension, two sources with knowledge of the plan told NBC News.",
      "Republicans detailed their strategy as they left a two-hour, closed-door meeting where they discussed their limited options Friday afternoon. Earlier in the day, leaders floated breaking up the package into three separate parts and having lawmakers vote on them individually on the floor, according to GOP sources familiar with the plan, but the one-package proposal was seen as an easier lift with the clock ticking down.",
      "Exiting the private GOP meeting, Johnson told reporters there would not be a shutdown and that House Republicans are \"unified.\" He said he would provide more details soon, while his deputy, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said there will \"very likely\" be a vote on the new plan in the House later Friday.",
      "\"We will not have a government shutdown, and we will meet our obligations for our farmers who need aid, for the disaster victims all over the country, and for making sure that military and essential services and everyone who relies upon the federal government for a paycheck is paid over the holidays,\" Johnson said.",
      "Johnson will brief Trump on the new plan, after speaking earlier Friday, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said.",
      "So far, the president-elect is choosing to remain silent on House GOP plans,\u00a0according to another source familiar with his thinking. Trump\u2019s preference is still to address the debt ceiling, that source said, adding, \"Johnson should have listened when the President-elect told him this a month ago. And in every conversation since.\u201d",
      "But Trump may be willing to take a \u201cwin\u201d on a funding deal that cuts a significant amount of what he saw as \u201cpork,\" the source continued, noting that the process gave Trump's team insight into where votes are in both parties for dealing with the debt limit next year.",
      "There is no guarantee at this point that critical parts of the plan can pass the House or the Senate, or get signed into law by President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cThe lines of communication have been reopened,\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters as he left a meeting with House Democrats, without committing support.",
      "On top of that, it could take days for the usually slow-moving Senate to debate and vote on any House funding package, meaning the federal government will very likely shut down into the weekend \u2014\u00a0if not over the Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's holidays.",
      "But Johnson has a major problem: He cannot pass a bill without Democrats, who still control the Senate and the White House and are determined not to give in to Trump's 11th-hour demands. If Johnson fails to deliver for Trump, it could jeopardize his prospects of being re-elected as speaker in two weeks, on Jan. 3, with a wafer-thin House majority.",
      "\"This is a defining moment for his career as speaker,\" said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., a Johnson critic. \"What he does and how he handles this, how he handles our conference ... will define who he is, if he is a serious leader, and if he's going to survive this leadership vote.\"",
      "Jeffries said Friday that Trump was rushing to set aside the debt limit so Republicans can pass a tax cut for the wealthy next year.",
      "\"A painful government shutdown that will crash the economy and hurt working class Americans, because they would rather enact massive tax cuts for their billionaire donors than fund cancer research for children,\" Jeffries said, referring to a provision in the original deal that GOP leaders stripped out.",
      "Senate Democrats have called on Johnson to return to the bipartisan deal that Trump and Musk blew up.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to go back to the original agreement we had just a few days ago. It\u2019s time for that. It\u2019s time the House votes on our bipartisan CR [continuing resolution],\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s the quickest, simplest and easiest way we can make sure the government stays open while delivering critical emergency aid to the American people.\u201d",
      "In the midst of the battle, Democrats believe they have found a populist economic message to rally voters to their side, depicting Musk as an oligarch who is pulling Trump\u2019s strings.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m ready to stay here through Christmas because we\u2019re not going to let Elon Musk run the government,\u201d Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement. \u201cPut simply, we should not let an unelected billionaire rip away research for pediatric cancer so he can get a tax cut.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Among the measures being debated by Congress to avert a government shutdown is increasing the debt ceiling \u2014 or eliminating it entirely.",
      "It's arguably the most unusual demand from President-elect Donald Trump and other Republicans seeking to ward off a major government disruption just as the holidays arrive.",
      "That's because, in recent decades, Republicans were the ones who sought to use debt-ceiling increases to extract concessions from Democrats, arguing that government spending was getting out of control.",
      "What is this unusual limit, and why have Republicans' views on it suddenly changed?",
      "Debt limit and default",
      "Like many other entities, the U.S. government borrows money to help pay its bills. The debt ceiling establishes that, at a certain point, the U.S. Treasury can no longer continue to borrow money to pay the government's fiscal obligations.",
      "But because those spending requirements will nevertheless continue to accrue, the failure to raise the debt limit would put the U.S. in technical default, meaning it could no longer pay its bills.",
      "The U.S. pays many of its bills through borrowing, so without that mechanism in place, whoever the government owes money to will, in an overwhelming number of cases, fail to be paid.",
      "That would send shockwaves through the U.S. economy and global financial markets. Current White House officials have said a default would likely cause a recession while also affecting everything from Social Security benefits to child tax credit payments to paying U.S. service members and contractors.",
      "A soft brake on government borrowing",
      "The debt ceiling is a relatively new instrument in the U.S.'s economic toolkit. For the first 128 years of the nation's existence, Congress directly authorized individual borrowing efforts.",
      "That changed in 1917, when Congress decided to impose a debt ceiling to replace separate borrowing votes and streamline the massive financial obligations imposed by World War I.",
      "In 1939, the government officially decided to use the debt ceiling in order to manage its debt obligations on an aggregate basis.",
      "Since then, the debt ceiling has served as a nominal brake on federal spending, allowing Congress to reflect on the debt load the U.S. is carrying at any given moment.",
      "Yet overall, most of that reflection hasn't gone very far. Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been raised 78 times \u2014 49 times under Republican presidents, and 29 times under Democratic administrations.",
      "Debt growth and gridlock worries",
      "Today, the U.S. has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, meaning it is borrowing more than it is producing.",
      "There remains debate among economists about whether that matters. Compared to other countries with large debt loads, the interest rates the U.S. pays to borrow money are relatively low. And until very recently, they had even been declining over a period of decades.",
      "That has changed since the pandemic, as financial markets have grown increasingly wary of both ongoing U.S. spending outlays, as well as overall political gridlock \u2014 especially fights over debt ceilings \u2014 which have created something of a vicious cycle.",
      "Financial authorities would prefer that the rate of U.S. spending slow down. Beyond that, the greater hope is that government officials stop fighting over whether to fund spending obligations that were already put on the books during the regular budgeting process.",
      "\"One day we should just have a bipartisan bill and get rid of the debt ceiling,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a 2021 interview. \"It\u2019s all politics.\u201d",
      "Bipartisan support",
      "So what if the debt ceiling were to simply go away entirely? It's something Democrats have long called for. Ultimately, they argue, there's neither a real legal reason nor, for now, a financial rationale for why the government can't continue to borrow money.",
      "Now, for the first time, the head of the Republican Party seems to be taking up that argument.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge,\u201d Trump exclusively told NBC News on Thursday. The debt limit, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean anything, except psychologically.\u201d",
      "The idea quickly gained support among some prominent Democrats.",
      "\u201cI agree with President-elect Trump that Congress should terminate the debt limit and never again govern by hostage taking,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Yet the reasons Trump wants to get rid of it now are likely twofold: First, it is already set to hit during the first few months of his second term in office. And second, his plan to cut taxes is expected to reduce federal revenues by trillions of dollars, meaning government spending obligations already signed into law would have to be covered by more borrowing.",
      "Despite the smattering of Democratic support, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries from New York's 8th District, has said elimination of the debt ceiling is a nonstarter.",
      "And fiscal conservatives continue to be opposed to debt ceiling elimination.",
      "\"My position is simple \u2014 I am not going to raise or suspend the debt ceiling (racking up more debt) without significant & real spending cuts attached to it,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in a post on X. \"I\u2019ve been negotiating to that end. No apologies.\"",
      "Roy has already drawn the ire of Trump for taking that position.",
      "\u201cThe very unpopular \u2018Congressman\u2019 from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory \u2014 All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself. Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "This time, it seems, the Democrats are positioning themselves as the guardians of fiscal responsibility."

      "Although travelers may hit snags in a shutdown, holiday deliveries likely wouldn\u2019t be impacted.",
      "The U.S. Postal Service runs as usual through shutdowns because the independent entity is generally funded by its own sales and services, not by tax dollars. As a shutdown neared in September 2023 \u2014 before being resolved just hours before it was set to begin \u2014\u00a0the Postal Service clarified that it would be able to deliver packages uninterrupted.",
      "However, the deadline for deliveries to arrive by Christmas Day has already passed this year for ground advantage and first-class mail. The Christmas cutoff date for priority mail express is fast approaching, at Dec. 21.",
      "The nearly 73 million people who receive Social Security benefits would keep receiving their checks if the government shuts down. That's because Social Security is considered a mandatory program that doesn't rely on the short-term funding that hangs in the balance on Capitol Hill.",
      "But anyone who may need to reach the Social Security Administration for help could experience longer wait times as agency staffers are furloughed. The agency's staffing is already at a 50-year low, as House Republicans rejected boosting funds for it in the package passed in September.",
      "Stock markets would digest the fallout day by day",
      "A government shutdown threatens more turmoil in a stock market that has endured a rough few weeks, risking higher anxiety for those eyeing their retirement accounts or stock portfolios ahead of the new year.",
      "Stocks rose Friday morning even as investors monitored the turmoil in Washington, which came on the heels of a 10-day string of declines for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, its longest losing streak since 1974. The Dow was up nearly 1% in mid-morning trading Friday, buoyed by encouraging inflation data.",
      "\"Government shutdowns have historically had little lasting impact on equity performance,\" the investment and tax advisory firm Edward Jones said in a note . \"Stocks were positive half the time during the government closures and were higher in most cases three and six months later.\"",
      "Still, the threat of a shutdown coincides with fresh signals from the Federal Reserve that it's planning cut interest rates at a slower pace than initially thought. That message from the central bank Wednesday sent the Dow tumbling, with the index notching its worst trading day since August.",
      "Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, said Thursday that markets were already on the decline after repeatedly soaring to new heights in 2024. He said the recent downturns marked a \"due\" pullback after the S&P 500 hit records 57 times this year.",
      "Prospective government shutdowns, on their own, usually trigger on Wall Street a \"very short emotional reaction followed by not very much,\" Hackett said, in line with the Edward Jones analysts. But, he added, the combined impact of the Fed decision and the shutdown risk has affected an already sensitive market like \"two cans of gasoline being thrown on a fire.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. government will shut down this weekend unless Congress comes up with a plan and acts soon.",
      "Federal funding expires\u00a0when the clock strikes 12:01 a.m. Saturday, and congressional Republicans are back to the drawing board after billionaire Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0blew up\u00a0their original bill and then a backup plan failed to pass Thursday night.",
      "Follow along for live government shutdown coverage",
      "As Congress debates a path forward, government operations that people rely on and\u00a0paychecks for millions of federal workers\u00a0hang in the balance.",
      "Here is what you need to know about what a government shutdown is and how it could affect you:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, meaning almost all government funding decisions take place on Capitol Hill. Each year Congress must pass spending bills before Oct. 1, the start of a new fiscal year, or the government runs out of money to keep functioning.",
      "If Congress fails to act before that date, the House and the Senate can also pass legislation called a continuing resolution to keep the government fully operating for a short period of time. Back in September, Congress did exactly that and set Dec. 20 as the new deadline.",
      "Now, Congress must act before the end of the day Friday or there will be a lapse in funding. Then, all nonessential government functions must stop.",
      "How did Congress get to this point?",
      "This is how the government spending process is designed to work: Appropriations committees in both chambers are supposed to\u00a0pass a dozen spending bills\u00a0that cover different federal agencies every year. Then the bills must pass both the full House and Senate before they go to the president\u2019s desk to be signed into law.",
      "That rarely happens in modern Congresses. As is now the norm, Congress ran out of time to finish the process in September, so it passed a short-term funding extension.",
      "Though Congress has known about the Dec. 20 deadline since the fall, it did not release a deal to avoid a shutdown until this week.",
      "On Tuesday night, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced the deal, which was struck between the top congressional Republicans and Democrats. It would have extended government funding until March 14 and provided economic assistance for farmers and relief for areas hit by hurricanes. It also included a small pay raise for members of Congress, at a maximum of 3.8%, for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "Before the House even scheduled a vote on it,\u00a0Musk began posting negatively about the bill to his more than 200 million followers on his platform, X. Trump and a series of far-right members of Congress came out against the plan, as well, calling it a giveaway to Democrats and criticizing some policy provisions, like the congressional raises.",
      "Trump also added a last-minute demand: that Congress include legislation to address the debt ceiling. The country is not expected to hit its borrowing limit until sometime next year, but on Thursday, Trump told NBC News he wants Congress to get rid of the debt ceiling entirely.",
      "House Republicans tried to pass a second bill to address Trump's concerns, but it failed, with nearly every Democrat and 38 Republicans voting against it. Now, they will have to figure out a new path as the clock ticks closer to the deadline.",
      "When would a shutdown begin? How long could one last?",
      "In the absence of last-minute action from Congress, a shutdown would start at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, so its effects would not be immediately felt until Monday.",
      "It is difficult to predict how long a shutdown could last, but if it happens, it could last for a while, given divisions on Capitol Hill and the upcoming holidays. Republicans have a narrow majority in the House, and Democrats control the Senate. That will change on Jan. 3, when Republicans take over both chambers of Congress, and then Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.,\u00a0posted on X\u00a0that she would support shutting down the government until Inauguration Day.",
      "What parts of the government would a shutdown affect?",
      "During a shutdown, the federal government would be\u00a0unable to pay its millions of employees, including members of the military and reservists, just before the holidays.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government workers could be furloughed, meaning they would temporarily stop going to work. During a shutdown in 2013, about\u00a0850,000 workers\u00a0were furloughed. But even those who have to keep performing essential duties would not be paid for the duration of a shutdown.",
      "Federal workers would receive retroactive pay when the government reopened, which was not always guaranteed until Congress passed a law after a shutdown in 2019.",
      "Some functions of the government would continue, including the military and public safety, like air traffic control and the Transportation Security Administration. Every federal agency creates a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d for how to operate during a shutdown and which employees are \u201cexcepted\u201d from being furloughed.",
      "The\u00a0Defense Department, for example, would require active military personnel to continue to report for duty, and inpatient care and emergency outpatient care in Pentagon medical treatment facilities would continue during a shutdown, a defense official told NBC News.",
      "Military retiree benefits would continue to be paid out because they come from a separate trust fund, not from congressional appropriations, but they could be slowed by a lack of personnel to process them, the official said.",
      "President Joe Biden and members of Congress\u00a0would all continue to work and be paid, as\u00a0required by law.",
      "Would a shutdown affect benefits and payments like Social Security?",
      "Social Security checks that go out to 73 million people in the United States every month\u00a0would continue\u00a0during a shutdown, as that is considered \u201cmandatory\u201d spending and not funded through the dozen appropriations bills Congress is supposed to pass each year.",
      "Other examples of mandatory spending that would continue are payments from\u00a0Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and veterans\u2019 benefits.",
      "How long did the longest government shutdown last?",
      "Congress has allowed funding to lapse several times in the past four decades, leading to\u00a020 shutdowns that lasted at least one full day.",
      "The longest shutdown was also the most recent: The government shut down for\u00a034 full days\u00a0from Dec. 21, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019.",
      "During that shutdown, national parks remained open, but trash started piling up with park employees furloughed. TSA employees, who were required to keep working without pay, started calling in sick, leading to delays at airports. The TSA administrator has warned that a shutdown this year would lead to longer waits heading into the holidays."

    "summary": "After nearly 30 years of poor play on the field and controversy off of it, it's finally fun to root for the Washington NFL franchise again.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Rosenberg had a major scheduling conflict last Sunday. With his first child due next month, he and his wife, Natalie, organized a baby shower to celebrate.",
      "Unfortunately, it was during the Washington Commanders game.",
      "Rosenberg, who grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, is a lifelong fan. He never misses a game and is particularly invested now that the team \u2014\u00a0after nearly three decades of poor performances on the field and multiple scandals off it \u2014 is good again.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to have kids for a long time, so this is very, very exciting. This is a really, really big deal,\u201d Rosenberg, a 45-year-old radio and TV host, said in an interview. \u201cBut I cannot emphasize enough how big of a deal it is in my life that this team doesn\u2019t bring me misery.\u201d",
      "With the Commanders vying for a postseason spot, every game is big. They were supposed to cruise against a hapless New Orleans Saints team that was starting a backup quarterback. Except late in the fourth quarter, Washington allowed a 17-point lead to diminish to one point.",
      "\u201cThe party is really getting going,\u201d said Rosenberg, who watched on an iPad. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be present and I\u2019m trying to be a part of it, but all of a sudden they give up a field goal and then another field goal and then the touchdown.\u201d",
      "When the Commanders did not allow the Saints to complete a two-point conversion, winning the game, he finally felt comfortable returning to the event.",
      "\u201cI threw my arms up in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cI walked around the room and greeted everyone officially, appropriately and happily. Natalie and I hugged and celebrated for a moment, and then I was able to fully enjoy our baby shower.\u201d",
      "What Rosenberg experienced \u2014 joy in a team that has mostly provided him anything but that \u2014 is a shared sentiment across the fan base. A once-proud franchise with three Super Bowl wins with three different starting quarterbacks in 1982, 1987 and 1991 fell into the depths of despair after much-maligned owner Dan Snyder bought it in 1999. However, since he sold the Commanders in April 2023, there has been a renewed sense of hope.",
      "Washington, at 9-5, is off to its best start since 1992. It has not won a playoff game since 2005, meaning an entire generation of fans has not experienced what it\u2019s like to root for a winning organization.\u00a0Times are changing.",
      "'The experience had been destroyed'",
      "When Jeffrey Wright was 6 years old, he won a raffle at Hecht\u2019s department store to be the \u201cMascot of the Week\u201d for that Sunday\u2019s game. The team fitted him out with a full uniform and let him run out onto the RFK Stadium field before the matchup. He then sat in the end zone and \u201cwatched [them] kick the teeth out of the Dallas Cowboys.\u201d",
      "Wright, an actor who is now 59, smiles thinking back to that afternoon. He has gone on to win Emmy, Golden Globe and Tony awards, yet memories of attending games with his mother \u2014 who had season tickets beginning in 1970 \u2014 hold just as much significance in shaping who he is today.",
      "But the team Wright grew to love as a kid changed completely when Snyder took over in 1999. A franchise once thought of as a pillar of the league has spent much of the last 25 years consistently losing on the field and embroiled in negativity off it. Under Snyder, there were more names (three) than playoff victories (two).",
      "So you can imagine why Wright was fine letting go of his mother\u2019s seats when she died in 2019.",
      "\u201cIt obviously wasn\u2019t the happiest thing to do. But it wasn\u2019t so difficult,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe franchise had been destroyed. The experience had been destroyed. I felt that something had been carved out of the heart of my childhood. I just felt, like a lot of us did, kind of abused by the relationship to the team. You just had to cut loose.\u201d",
      "It was a notion shared by much of the fan base.",
      "In 24 seasons under Snyder, the team had just six playoff appearances, four NFC East titles and three double-digit winning seasons. He had 27 different starting quarterbacks and 10 head coaches. The team\u2019s .427 winning percentage ranked 27th in the NFL from 1999 to 2022.",
      "On top of the poor product on the field, Snyder found himself surrounded by negativity off it. The team was widely criticized for how it was run from the top down. In both 2021 and 2023, the NFL fined it $10 million and $60 million, respectively, after investigations of allegations of sexual harassment and workplace conduct.",
      "Snyder also faced backlash for the way he treated fans, including charging to attend training camp \u2014 the first time that had occurred in NFL history \u2014 and suing people who tried to back out of ticket renewal plans. One of those fans, a 72-year-old grandmother, had had season tickets since the early 1960s.",
      "The team\u2019s name was also a hot-button topic. Snyder vowed publicly to \u201cnever change the name\u201d from \u201cRedskins\u201d even though it had long been condemned as an anti-Indigenous slur. But in 2020, after years of pressure from the NFL, major sponsors and groups like the National Congress of American Indians, the franchise moved on.",
      "While not all fans were happy with the decision, those who opposed the name felt they finally could root for a franchise without feeling in the wrong.",
      "\u201cWe were not only the laughingstock of the NFL, but we were morally corrupt,\u201d said Eddie Huang, a writer, director and chef. \u201cI had Redskins stuff; we all did. But when you get older, you\u2019re just like: \u2018Whoa, this is terrible. Dan Snyder is terrible. The name is bad. There\u2019s a lot of bad stuff going on.\u2019\u201d",
      "Asked to sum up Snyder\u2019s tenure in one word, Wright said, \u201cMisery.\u201d",
      "Grant Paulsen, a local radio host at 106.7 The Fan, has been covering the team since 1999. He began as a beat reporter with the station and four years later transitioned to be a midday host.",
      "With countless fans calling in each day, nobody else knows the pulse of the community like he does. He said Snyder was so unlikable that people refused to buy team merchandise and stopped attending games simply because it felt wrong to support him.",
      "In Snyder\u2019s final season in charge, a franchise that once led the league in average attendance ranked dead last.",
      "\u201cTo me, if the fandom of his team was a block of ice, he was taking a chisel and just swinging it,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cLittle by little, just chipping away and chipping away until it was all gone.\u201d",
      "A new hope",
      "For a while, it appeared there was no chance Snyder, 60, would sell.",
      "When he agreed to sell the franchise for more than $6 billion to a group led by Josh Harris in May 2023, the decision sent shock waves through the fan base.",
      "Harris\u2019 group, which included NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, brought on advisers like former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers to assist in a search for a new general manager and head coach. They landed Adam Peters, previously the assistant general manager of the San Francisco 49ers, and former Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Quinn.",
      "But the biggest move came in the 2024 NFL draft. The Commanders selected LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels, the winner of the Heisman Trophy, at No. 2 overall to be the savior of the franchise. So far, he has lived up to the hype.",
      "Daniels has thrown for 3,045 yards, 17 touchdowns and only six interceptions through 14 games. He has also run for 656 yards (46.9 per game), the second most in the league behind reigning MVP Lamar Jackson.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the quarterback we\u2019ve deserved for suffering all these years,\u201d Huang said. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy. I absolutely think this kid is the face of the NFL for the next 15 years.\u201d",
      "Nothing encapsulated that feeling more than Daniels\u2019 Hail Mary touchdown pass in the final seconds against the Chicago Bears in October. Trailing 15-12 with six seconds remaining, Daniels avoided multiple defenders and launched a 52-yard bomb toward the end zone. The ball tipped off multiple players and landed in the hands of receiver Noah Brown for the game-winner.",
      "More than 65,000 fans at Northwest Stadium in the Maryland suburb of Landover lost their minds, including Wright, who was filming Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Agency\u201d in London. He said he immediately left for Washington Dulles International Airport from the game and, despite the jet lag, \u201ccould have stayed up for three days after that flight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a moment like that in a stadium in D.C. in decades,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just so pumped. That was an absolute jet lag cure. That was a memorable, memorable night in the story of this franchise. It was just a stamp on the beginning of a new era.\u201d"

      "The haul of new species was also accompanied by another 48 species that are potentially new to science but require further analysis, the report said.",
      "\u201cOverall, the RAP team encountered exceptionally high levels of biodiversity that far exceeded expectations considering most of the study sites were located near communities and towns,\u201d the report said, adding that the findings \u201chighlight the importance of research and conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes.\u201d",
      "In addition to the amphibious mouse and unusual-looking catfish, scientists discovered another type of mouse with stiff, spiny fur and a squirrel only distantly related to others known by science, as well as a new bat and several types of fish, butterflies and amphibians.",
      "While discovering new species of insects and even fish is not uncommon, the most significant takeaway from the report is the documentation of new mammals, said Chris Jiggins, an evolutionary biology professor at Britain's University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing \u2014 to find four new species of mammals unknown to science is pretty impressive. The amphibious mouse is something I\u2019ve never heard of. It\u2019s quite extraordinary,\u201d Jiggins told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday.",
      "This is the first report in which scientists have described these species; the Indigenous groups in the area who assisted scientists in their work have extensive knowledge about many of them, said Trond Larsen, the head of Conservation International\u2019s Rapid Assessment Program and one of the report\u2019s authors.",
      "\u201cIt was really fantastic to work so closely with the Awajun people. They have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with,\u201d Larsen told Reuters.",
      "While Larsen and his team were understandably thrilled about finding the previously unknown species \u2014 one of the squirrels was \u201cadorable and beautiful chestnut-brown color, very fast,\u201d Larsen added \u2014 the report Conservation International released also highlights the need to do more to protect endangered species.",
      "The RAP paper noted that the exhibition also documented 49 species designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature \u2014 the global authority on the matter \u2014 including two types of critically endangered monkeys.",
      "\u201cThese forests in the foothills of the Andes going into the Amazon are the most diverse in the world,\u201d Jiggins, at the University of Cambridge, said. \u201cIt\u2019s all heavily endangered and while there are still big tracts protected by those countries, they\u2019re still under threat from the usual suspects.\u201d",
      "\u201cDocumenting this diversity is so important,\u201d he added, \u201cand we can\u2019t make an argument for protecting it if we don\u2019t know what\u2019s there.\u201d"

      "As U.S. diplomats arrived in Damascus on Friday,\u00a0Syria's de facto new leader\u00a0Ahmed al-Sharaa will likely have greeted them\u00a0with a clear message: Under his rule, there will be no threat to the West.",
      "Sharaa, who has dropped his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been pushing this line in meetings with Western diplomats and the media since rebel forces, led by his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. As his new administration takes charge, he has also called for the United States and other countries to drop sanctions against Syria.",
      "\u201cNow, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,\u201d Sharaa, dressed in a smart suit and a white shirt, told the BBC in an interview earlier this week, having abandoned the camouflage military fatigues and turban he once wore as a jihadist leader.",
      "\u201cThe victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,\u201d he added.",
      "He has also attempted to move away from his past as a jihadist leader with links to both the Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda.",

      "Sharaa has \u201cbeen embracing a more conventional image,\u201d Joze Pelayo, an associate director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told NBC News. \u201cBut I think he needs to walk the talk for that recognition and for that approval to remain sustainable.\u201d",
      "Sharaa has also attempted to present HTS as more moderate, insisting in his BBC interview that it should not be considered a terrorist group because it does not target civilians or civilian areas.",
      "Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, which barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, the BBC reported that Sharaa said he would be much more inclusive and had pointed to HTS' record in regions it has governed in recent years, particularly in the city of Idlib in Syria\u2019s northwest.",
      "There, he said, universities had been teaching \u201cfor more than eight years,\u201d adding, \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sharaa also promised that a Syrian committee of legal experts would be formed to write a new constitution for the country. \u201cThey will decide. And any ruler or president will have to follow the law,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s saying all of the things that I think Washington and Europe want to hear in terms of a transition leading to a government that\u2019s inclusive and reflective of the will of all Syrians,\u201d said Dana Stroul, a former senior Defense Department official who served in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is, how long that will hold? Will he walk the walk and not just talk the talk? And if he doesn\u2019t win in the elections, will he peacefully stand aside for whoever does win? I think those are big questions,\" added Stroul, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "The Biden administration has said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations \u2014 but that will depend on whether it views Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what they do now and certainly making clear that they want to be inclusive in dealing with other groups inside Syria, making clear that they respect women and minorities as they stand up interim governing authorities \u2014 making clear that Syria won\u2019t be used as a base for terrorist groups,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a briefing Tuesday.",
      "But while many are wary of Sharaa's transformation, throughout Syria's civil war he carved out his own path during his rise to power, defying ISIS and Al Qaeda along the way."

    "summary": "Nearly a dozen families learned from NBC News that their relative\u2019s body was sent to the University of North Texas Health Science Center for medical research.",
    "story": [
      "This article is part of\u00a0\u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d\u00a0a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "Some knew their loved one had died, but not what had been done with the body. Others spent years searching, only to discover that their relatives had spent their final hours alone, with no family called to their side. Nearly all said they would have honored the dead with funerals, if only they had known.",
      "Instead, these mothers, fathers, sons and daughters were outraged to learn weeks, months or even years later that their relatives\u2019 bodies had been given to a Texas medical school to be studied and dissected, NBC News found in a yearlong investigation. Some of the corpses were injected with preservatives and assigned to medical students. Others were frozen and cut up, their torsos, skull bones, legs and arms leased out to for-profit companies and the military. No one had consented to this treatment.",
      "Nearly a dozen of these families received the grim and grisly truth not from a medical examiner,\u00a0hospital or police officer \u2014 but from NBC News and Noticias Telemundo, including six who found their relative\u2019s name on a list of unclaimed bodies published by the news outlets in October.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know she was dead or what happened to her,\u201d said Abigail Willson, whose mother died at a Fort Worth hospice last year, and then was given without her consent to the Fort Worth-based University of North Texas Health Science Center. \u201cWe have searched everywhere, all over Texas. If you wouldn\u2019t have put out that list of names, we never would have known.\u201d",
      "For more on this story, watch \"Hallie Jackson NOW\" on NBC News NOW tonight at 5 p.m. ET",
      "Last year, NBC News revealed in its \u201cLost Rites\u201d series that coroners and medical examiners across the country had repeatedly failed to notify families of their loved ones\u2019 deaths before burying them in paupers\u2019 graves. That investigation led reporters to North Texas, where officials had come to treat the unclaimed dead not as an expensive burden but as a free resource. Since 2019, Dallas and Tarrant counties had sent about 2,350 unclaimed bodies to the Health Science Center and, of them, more than 830 were selected for dissection and study.",
      "The center advertised these human specimens as being of \u201cthe highest quality found anywhere in the U.S,\u201d helping bring in about $2.5 million a year in the process. Heads went for $649. A pair of feet brought in $330. The fee for a whole body: $1,400.",
      "The center suspended its body donation program in response to NBC News\u2019 investigation, fired the officials who led it and announced that it would stop using unclaimed bodies. In statements to reporters, the Health Science Center has offered condolences to families affected by what the center called failures of management, care and professionalism.",
      "The families who learned from NBC News that their relatives were studied without consent are continuing to mourn their lost loved ones. The dead included military veterans and blue-collar workers. Men and women who struggled with drug addiction and mental illness. A World War II history buff. A young murder victim.",
      "These are some of their stories.",
      "Denzil \u201cDale\u201d Leggett",
      "On the rare occasion he allowed someone to get close to him, Dale Leggett was known for his warm demeanor and dry sense of humor. He enjoyed discussing World War II history and Marvel comic books. He also was extremely private and avoided most social gatherings, his family said.",
      "He did little besides go to work day after day, operating a forklift at the same Fort Worth warehouse for four decades. His two siblings tended to see him only once or twice a year, but they loved him dearly.",
      "Neither of them were contacted when Leggett died of respiratory failure at the age of 71 in a Fort Worth hospital in May 2023. His younger brother, Tim Leggett, was stunned when he spotted his sibling's name on the list on NBCNews.com.",
      "Finding out that way, he said, was \u201chorrendous and tragic.\u201d In the months since, he has worked to piece together what happened."

      "Death row inmate Robert Roberson, who faces the prospect of becoming the\u00a0first person in the U.S. to be executed for a \u201cshaken baby\u201d death, was a no-show Friday at a hearing before a Texas state House committee where he was supposed to testify.",
      "It was not immediately clear why the condemned man wasn\u2019t allowed to attend, but his absence was noted a day after the Texas state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office ordered the prison system to disregard the subpoena for Roberson to be transported to the state capital Austin for the hearing.",
      "The AG\u2019s office also objected in October when state lawmakers issued a similar subpoena for Roberson to testify in Austin, a legal gambit that wound up halting his Oct. 17 execution with only hours to spare.",
      "Roberson, who has steadfastly maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki, had been summoned to testify in his case as it relates to a 2013 \u201cjunk science\u201d law allowing Texas inmates to potentially challenge convictions based on advances in forensic science.",
      "This time, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice was ordered to transport Roberson from the prison north of Houston where he is being held to the state Capitol in Austin.",
      "The office of Attorney General Ken Paxton objected, saying, \u201cIn addition to presenting serious security risks, the subpoena is procedurally defective and therefore invalid as it was issued in violation of the House Rules, the Texas Constitution, and other applicable laws.\u201d",
      "Previously, Paxton said in October that there were safety concerns with having Roberson brought before lawmakers and cited a lack of a state facility near Austin that could temporarily house him. The state had said he could testify virtually.",
      "In response, the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence offered a compromise that its members could meet with Roberson in prison. They said they were uncomfortable with the video option, given his autism and unfamiliarity with the technology. The meeting, however, never happened.",
      "House committee lawmakers decided to issue a second subpoena after the attorney general\u2019s office challenged the initial one. The original subpoena was an unusual legal gambit that set off a flurry of litigation that put Roberson's execution on hold mere hours before he was to be executed on Oct. 17.",
      "The House committee members said they still want Roberson to be able to testify in his case as it relates to a 2013 \"junk science\" law that allows Texas inmates to potentially challenge convictions based on advances in forensic science.",
      "\"Robert's testimony will shed important light on some of the problems with our 'junk science writ' process, a legal procedure Texas lawmakers expected to provide reconsideration in cases like this one,\" committee chair and state Rep. Joe Moody, a Democrat, and committee member and state Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican, said in a statement. \"His perspective will be especially valuable as a person on the autism spectrum whose neurodivergence profoundly influenced both his case and his access to justice on appeal.\"",
      "Last month, the Texas Supreme Court sided with state officials, saying lawmakers could not use their subpoena power to effectively halt an execution. However, they said the committee members could still compel Roberson to testify.",
      "The attorney general's office has not set a new execution date.",
      "Meanwhile, the lawmakers and Paxton have\u00a0sparred publicly over Roberson's case, with each accusing the other of \"misrepresenting\" details that led to his conviction in his daughter\u2019s death and releasing their own reports in recent weeks rebutting each other\u2019s claims.",
      "Doctors and law enforcement quickly concluded Nikki was killed as a result of a violent shaking episode. But Roberson\u2019s defense says a new understanding of so-called\u00a0shaken baby syndrome\u00a0shows that other medical conditions can be factors in a child's death, as they believe it was in Nikki\u2019s."

    "summary": "Nuna Baby Essentials is voluntarily recalling more than 600,000 RAVA car seats.",
    "story": [
      "Nuna Baby Essentials has recalled more than 600,000 of its RAVA car seats because debris may prevent the harness from staying snug.",
      "The recall affects RAVA models made from July 16, 2016, to Oct. 25, 2023, the company said. In those car seats, debris may get stuck where the front harness adjuster button is, impeding the mechanism from properly clamping on the strap.",
      "\"A loose harness may not properly restrain the occupant, increasing the risk of injury in a crash,\" Nuna said on its website.",
      "Nuna RAVA models manufactured after Oct. 25, 2023, are not included in the recall. Those models have a fabric covering over the harness adjusters, rather than plastic.",
      "The affected car seats do not have to be disposed of or returned to stores. Instead, the company is offering customers a new seat pad, cleaning kit and care instructions to keep the harness adjuster clean.",
      "The free remedy kit can be ordered on Nuna's website, which includes instructions on how to check whether a car seat's harness is functioning properly. If it is, customers can continue to use the seats \"as directed,\" Nuna said.",
      "Nuna, a high-end company that also makes strollers and other baby gear, described the voluntary recall as a \u201cproactive step.\u201d There have been no injuries or fatalities reported in connection with the issue, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said of the 608,786 recalled car seats.",
      "Dr. Alisa Baer, a pediatrician and co-founder of The Car Seat Lady, an advocacy organization devoted to preventing injuries in cars, said snug car seat straps are crucial because they minimize how much infants and children move in the event of a crash.",
      "\"The looser the child is in the straps, the longer it takes to stop,\" she said. \"You do not want to make contact with anything except your seat belt or car seat straps in a crash.\"",
      "Baer said that sand, dirt or crumbs can get caught in any car seat's harness adjuster, not just the Nuna's. When that happens, children can accidentally loosen the car seat straps if they lean forward because the locking mechanism might not work, she said.",
      "\u201cChildren are not known for their neatness,\u201d Baer said. \u201cThe gripper teeth just don\u2019t grip as well on a slick surface.\u201d",
      "She advised parents to use a dry brush or toothbrush to clean all car seat straps of debris, and she suggested checking to make sure the straps stay in place when buckled in.",
      "\"You should notice no give in the straps. They shouldn't budge,\" she said.",
      "Model numbers of the Nuna car seats can be found on the label on the underside of the seat. The recalled model numbers are:",

      "\u201cIn the north of the Strip in particular, the recent military offensive is a clear illustration of the brutal war the Israeli forces are waging on Gaza, and we are witnessing clear signs of ethnic cleansing as Palestinian life is being wiped off the area,\u201d it said.",

      "Europe\u2019s most populous country is expected to vote on Feb. 23. On Monday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left coalition government collapsed after he\u00a0lost a confidence vote.",
      "It is only the sixth time such a vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe\u2019s largest economy. It was required because, in post-World War II\u00a0Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag, or parliament, to dissolve itself.",
      "Scholz expected to lose the vote, but had hoped that it would boost the fortunes of his center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP), which had formed a fractious coalition government with the pro-market Free Democrats and the environmentalist Green Party.",
      "Before calling the vote, Scholz accused Christian Lindner, his finance minister and\u00a0Free Democrats member, of violating his trust after he publicly backed a different economic policy than the one they had agreed upon.",
      "While mainstream parties have traditionally boycotted the AfD, meaning they will not form governing coalitions with the movement, the party is running second in opinion polls, according to Reuters, and might be able to thwart either a center-right or center-left majority.",
      "Founded in April 2013 as a movement against the euro currency, the AfD has shifted its focus to combatting Islam and immigration and has grown in popularity at both local and national levels ever since, particularly in the former East Germany, which has lagged economically behind the west of the country.",
      "In September, it became the first far-right party to win the most votes in a state election since the Nazi era, when it triumphed in Thuringia.",
      "The win came despite a string of controversies linked to its leadership. The party is monitored by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism. Party leader Bj\u00f6rne H\u00f6cke has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully employing Nazi rhetoric. He has appealed the rulings.",
      "And in May the party\u2019s top candidate, Maximilian Krah, was forced to withdraw from campaigning after he told an Italian newspaper that the SS, the Nazis\u2019 main paramilitary force, were \u201cnot all criminals.\u201d One of his aides was also charged with spying for China, and another candidate faced allegations of receiving bribes from a pro-Russian news portal.",
      "Musk also voiced support for the AfD last year when he criticized\u00a0 the German government over its handling\u00a0of illegal migration.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who has been tasked by President-elect Donald Trump with co-leading a commission called the Department of Government Efficiency, also called for the sacking of Italian judges who had questioned the legality of government measures to prevent irregular immigration.",

      "\u201cThe CFPB\u2019s attacks on Zelle are legally and factually flawed, and the timing of this lawsuit appears to be driven by political factors unrelated to Zelle,\" Jane Khodos, Zelle spokesperson, said in an emailed statement. \"Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law.\"",

      "Though Powell said Wednesday that inflation has \u201cmoved much closer\u201d to the Fed\u2019s goal, he said the changes in the projected path for rate cuts reflects \u201cthe expectation inflation will be higher\u201d in the year ahead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 19:58:04 GMT",
    "summary": "OpenAI\u2019s \u201c12 Days of Shipmas,\u201d which wrapped up on Friday, brought a sense of levity to end the year.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI\u2019s \u201c12 Days of Shipmas,\u201d which wrapped up on Friday, brought a sense of levity to end the year. The marketing blitz served as a way for the high-profile and controversial AI startup to show it can release an extensive roster of new features and tools while also having some fun.",
      "But when the calendar turns, the company faces some serious challenges. Most notably, there\u2019s co-founder\u00a0Elon Musk, who now runs rival startup xAI, and is in the midst of a\u00a0heated legal battle\u00a0with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that could have a big impact on the company\u2019s future.",
      "The threat Musk poses to OpenAI is even more significant considering the hefty amount of influence the world\u2019s richest person is poised to assume as part of the incoming Trump administration.",
      "In recent months, Musk has sued\u00a0Microsoft-backed OpenAI and\u00a0asked a court\u00a0to stop the company from converting to a for-profit corporation from a nonprofit. In posts on X, he\u00a0described\u00a0that effort as a \u201ctotal scam\u201d and\u00a0claimed\u00a0that \u201cOpenAI is evil.\u201d At The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit earlier this month, Altman\u00a0said\u00a0he views xAI as a \u201cfierce competitor.\u201d",
      "The pressure on OpenAI is tied in large part to its $157 billion valuation, achieved in the two years since the company launched its viral chatbot, ChatGPT, and kicked off the boom in generative AI. OpenAI\u00a0closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, gearing up to aggressively compete with xAI as well as Microsoft,\u00a0Google,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and Anthropic in a market that\u2019s\u00a0predicted to top $1 trillion\u00a0in revenue within a decade.",
      "Alongside the drama swirling around OpenAI and Altman, the Shipmas shtick served as a way for the company to shift the focus to its technology and generate buzz for its products.",
      "The most significant release over the 12 days was the public launch of\u00a0Sora, OpenAI\u2019s much-hyped video-generation tool, on Dec. 9.",
      "Using Sora, which OpenAI first announced in February, is relatively simple: A user types out a desired scene, and the engine will return a high-definition video clip. Sora can also create clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames.\u00a0While other AI video tools are available, Sora has been by far the most anticipated because of the power of OpenAI\u2019s large language models.",
      "On Wednesday, OpenAI gave users a\u00a0new way to talk to its viral chatbot: 1-800-CHATGPT. Those in the U.S. can dial the number (1-800-242-8478) for 15 minutes free per month, OpenAI said, and WhatsApp users globally can message the chatbot at the same number.",
      "Other announcements included the full release of OpenAI\u2019s new o1 AI model focused on reasoning, a demo of video and screen-sharing options in ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, the ability to organize work into \u201cProjects\u201d within ChatGPT, a wider rollout of\u00a0ChatGPT Search\u00a0and new developer tools. The company also used the marketing push to talk about its\u00a0integration with Apple\u00a0for the iPhone, iPad and macOS.",
      "OpenAI closed out its 12-day run of releases on Friday by announcing its newest frontier model, o3, as well as o3 mini. On a\u00a0livestream, Altman said the company would not publicly launch the models Friday but would make them immediately available for public safety testing.",
      "The company launched o1 in September, and in skipping straight to o3, Altman said he\u2019s continuing \u201cthe grand tradition of OpenAI being really, truly bad at names.\u201d",
      "The campaign was celebrated in some corners for the company\u2019s ability to make a strong year-end push, and criticized by others as significantly more hype than substance. Either way, OpenAI is well aware that competition is heating up \u2014\u00a0and quickly.",
      "One of its chief rivals, Amazon-backed Anthropic, was founded by early OpenAI researchers and has been attracting top talent. In May, OpenAI safety leader Jan Leike left OpenAI for Anthropic, and in August, OpenAI co-founder John Schulman announced he was\u00a0leaving\u00a0to join the rival startup. They were part of a wave of departures that culminated in September, when\u00a0three top leaders, most notably technology chief Mira Murati, announced their exits on the same day.",
      "Microsoft tension",
      "A recent report by Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures found that OpenAI\u00a0ceded market share\u00a0this year in enterprise AI, declining from 50% to 34%, while Anthropic doubled its market share from 12% to 24%. The results came from a survey of 600 enterprise IT decision-makers from companies with 50 or more employees, according to the report.",
      "One key area where the two companies appear poised to go head-to-head is in defense, as AI companies walk back earlier bans on military use of their products and enter into partnerships with big players in the industry and the U.S. Department of Defense.",
      "The day before OpenAI\u2019s Shipmas event began, the company\u00a0announced a partnership with Anduril, allowing the defense tech provider to deploy advanced AI systems for \u201cnational security missions.\u201d Last month, Anthropic and defense software vendor\u00a0Palantir\u00a0announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to \u201cprovide U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access\u201d to Anthropic\u2019s AI systems.",
      "The primary battle, though, is still for users. Altman\u00a0said publicly\u00a0earlier this month that OpenAI now has 300 million weekly active users. Over the next year, the company is reportedly\u00a0targeting 1 billion.",
      "That level of growth will likely require a pricey marketing push and fast-tracked feature launches, as the company advances in its two-year timeline for transitioning from a nonprofit into a fully for-profit company. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it had hired\u00a0its first chief marketing officer, nabbing Kate Rouch from crypto company\u00a0Coinbase.",
      "Then there\u2019s the increasingly complicated relationship with Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s lead investor and key cloud provider. While both companies continue to tout the value of their close partnership, there are increasing signs of tension.",
      "Following Altman\u2019s abrupt but short-lived ouster from OpenAI late last year, reports surfaced that Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella\u00a0was not briefed beforehand. After Altman was quickly reinstated, OpenAI gave Microsoft a non-voting board seat. Microsoft\u00a0relinquished\u00a0the position in July.",
      "In March, Nadella\u00a0brought\u00a0on Mustafa Suleyman, who had co-founded AI research company DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. Suleyman, later co-founded and led startup Inflection AI, and was effectively acquihired by Microsoft.",
      "In its annual report published in July, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor, adding the company to a roster that for years has included megacap peers\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Apple,\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Meta. And in October, OpenAI\u00a0debuted a search feature within ChatGPT\u00a0that positions it to better compete with search engines like\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s Bing.",
      "But the thorniest issue heading into the new year likely involves Musk, who has been a fixture at President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida since the election.",
      "Trump has said in the past that he would repeal President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0AI executive order,\u00a0issued\u00a0in October 2023, which introduced new safety assessments, equity and civil rights guidance and research on AI\u2019s impact on the labor market.",
      "Musk is set to to lead the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is expected to function as an advisory office, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk, who also runs\u00a0Tesla\u00a0and SpaceX and owns social media company X, influence over federal agencies\u2019 budgets, staffing and regulations in ways that favor his companies.",
      "\u201cStarting to feel like The @DOGE has real potential,\u201d Musk\u00a0posted\u00a0on X last month.",

    "summary": "Among the measures being debated by Congress to avert a government shutdown is increasing the debt ceiling \u2014 or eliminating it entirely.",
    "story": [
      "Among the measures being debated by Congress to avert a government shutdown is increasing the debt ceiling \u2014 or eliminating it entirely.",
      "It's arguably the most unusual demand from President-elect Donald Trump and other Republicans seeking to ward off a major government disruption just as the holidays arrive.",
      "That's because, in recent decades, Republicans were the ones who sought to use debt-ceiling increases to extract concessions from Democrats, arguing that government spending was getting out of control.",
      "What is this unusual limit, and why have Republicans' views on it suddenly changed?",
      "Debt limit and default",
      "Like many other entities, the U.S. government borrows money to help pay its bills. The debt ceiling establishes that, at a certain point, the U.S. Treasury can no longer continue to borrow money to pay the government's fiscal obligations.",
      "But because those spending requirements will nevertheless continue to accrue, the failure to raise the debt limit would put the U.S. in technical default, meaning it could no longer pay its bills.",
      "The U.S. pays many of its bills through borrowing, so without that mechanism in place, whoever the government owes money to will, in an overwhelming number of cases, fail to be paid.",
      "That would send shockwaves through the U.S. economy and global financial markets. Current White House officials have said a default would likely cause a recession while also affecting everything from Social Security benefits to child tax credit payments to paying U.S. service members and contractors.",
      "A soft brake on government borrowing",
      "The debt ceiling is a relatively new instrument in the U.S.'s economic toolkit. For the first 128 years of the nation's existence, Congress directly authorized individual borrowing efforts.",
      "That changed in 1917, when Congress decided to impose a debt ceiling to replace separate borrowing votes and streamline the massive financial obligations imposed by World War I.",
      "In 1939, the government officially decided to use the debt ceiling in order to manage its debt obligations on an aggregate basis.",
      "Since then, the debt ceiling has served as a nominal brake on federal spending, allowing Congress to reflect on the debt load the U.S. is carrying at any given moment.",
      "Yet overall, most of that reflection hasn't gone very far. Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been raised 78 times \u2014 49 times under Republican presidents, and 29 times under Democratic administrations.",
      "Debt growth and gridlock worries",
      "Today, the U.S. has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, meaning it is borrowing more than it is producing.",
      "There remains debate among economists about whether that matters. Compared to other countries with large debt loads, the interest rates the U.S. pays to borrow money are relatively low. And until very recently, they had even been declining over a period of decades.",
      "That has changed since the pandemic, as financial markets have grown increasingly wary of both ongoing U.S. spending outlays, as well as overall political gridlock \u2014 especially fights over debt ceilings \u2014 which have created something of a vicious cycle.",
      "Financial authorities would prefer that the rate of U.S. spending slow down. Beyond that, the greater hope is that government officials stop fighting over whether to fund spending obligations that were already put on the books during the regular budgeting process.",
      "\"One day we should just have a bipartisan bill and get rid of the debt ceiling,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a 2021 interview. \"It\u2019s all politics.\u201d",
      "Bipartisan support",
      "So what if the debt ceiling were to simply go away entirely? It's something Democrats have long called for. Ultimately, they argue, there's neither a real legal reason nor, for now, a financial rationale for why the government can't continue to borrow money.",
      "Now, for the first time, the head of the Republican Party seems to be taking up that argument.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge,\u201d Trump exclusively told NBC News on Thursday. The debt limit, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean anything, except psychologically.\u201d",
      "The idea quickly gained support among some prominent Democrats.",
      "\u201cI agree with President-elect Trump that Congress should terminate the debt limit and never again govern by hostage taking,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Yet the reasons Trump wants to get rid of it now are likely twofold: First, it is already set to hit during the first few months of his second term in office. And second, his plan to cut taxes is expected to reduce federal revenues by trillions of dollars, meaning government spending obligations already signed into law would have to be covered by more borrowing.",
      "Despite the smattering of Democratic support, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries from New York's 8th District, has said elimination of the debt ceiling is a nonstarter.",
      "And fiscal conservatives continue to be opposed to debt ceiling elimination.",
      "\"My position is simple \u2014 I am not going to raise or suspend the debt ceiling (racking up more debt) without significant & real spending cuts attached to it,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in a post on X. \"I\u2019ve been negotiating to that end. No apologies.\"",
      "Roy has already drawn the ire of Trump for taking that position.",
      "\u201cThe very unpopular \u2018Congressman\u2019 from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory \u2014 All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself. Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "This time, it seems, the Democrats are positioning themselves as the guardians of fiscal responsibility."

      "TODAY.com has reached out to LaPaglia and O\u2019Malley respectively for additional comment.",
      "Who are Brianna LaPaglia and Grace O\u2019Malley?",
      "LaPaglia, 25, and O\u2019Malley, 26, had been best friends growing up in Massachusetts and had together hosted the \u201cPlan Bri Uncut\u201d podcast under Barstool Sports.",
      "LaPaglia also co-hosts Barstool\u2019s \u201cBFFs\u201d podcast and spoke in a Dec. 11 episode about starting the \u201cPlan Bri\u201d podcast solo from her dorm room as a college advice show. When LaPaglia moved to New York to pursue the podcast with Barstool, she invited O\u2019Malley to move with her. O\u2019Malley eventually became co-host of \u201cPlan Bri\u201d and had been for the last two years, according to LaPaglia.",
      "LaPaglia had went through a public breakup with country music star Zach Bryan in the fall. In a Nov. 7 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d LaPaglia had reflected on the split and accused Bryan of \u201cnarcissistic, emotional abuse for a year.\u201d (Bryan has not responded to LaPaglia\u2019s claims. He and LaPaglia did not return TODAY.com\u2019s requests for additional comment at the time.)",
      "As for O\u2019Malley, she is pursuing a career in comedy. She opened several shows for Whitney Cummings on her \u201cBig Baby Tour\u201d this fall. She\u2019s now on her own stand-up tour that goes into the spring.",
      "After her fallout with LaPaglia, O\u2019Malley said in a statement on her Instagram story Dec. 16 that she was parting ways with Barstool. On Dec. 19, O\u2019Malley and the Unwell Network, headed by podcaster (and former Barstool talent) Alex Cooper, said she was joining the Unwell family. They did not provide details about what that entails.",
      "When did Brianna Chickenfry and Grace O\u2019Malley\u2019s fallout happen?",
      "It\u2019s unclear when exactly O\u2019Malley and LaPaglia\u2019s friendship began to falter.",
      "However, fans began to speculate that something was amiss with the duo after O\u2019Malley celebrated her 26th birthday in October. She posted on Instagram a myriad of photos with friends, thanking them for celebrating with her.",
      "\u201ci had myself one of the best birthdays of all time,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cthank you so very kindly to all of you sweeties who reached out and showed out. much love xoxo.\u201d",
      "LaPaglia was not pictured in any of the photos. Plus, \u201cPlan Bri\u201d hadn\u2019t had a new episode since Oct. 10, leading fans to wonder if something was amiss.",
      "What has Brianna Chickenfry said?",
      "Some had speculated that LaPaglia\u2019s relationship with Bryan had caused a strain in hers with O\u2019Malley. When LaPaglia opened up about her breakup with Bryan on the Nov. 7 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d co-host Dave Portnoy asked LaPaglia how her friendship with O\u2019Malley was now that she and Bryan split.",
      "\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and Grace will always be fine.\u201d",
      "Then in the Dec. 12 episode of \u201cBFFs,\u201d LaPaglia shared that she and O\u2019Malley were indeed on the outs and opened up about her side of the story.",
      "She said about a year and a half ago, the internet began pitting her and O\u2019Malley against each other. Then when she began dating Bryan, that relationship formed a \u201cwedge\u201d in her friendship with O\u2019Malley.",
      "\u201cBut she knew that this was the worst year of my life,\u201d LaPaglia said. \u201cThis is when the internet started attacking me. They only lift Grace up when they're beating me down. ... It was, like, whatever because it helped her career, and she was fine and happy about it. But it got to a point where she was, like, never defending me.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can hate (Bryan), but you can still be there for me,\u201d LaPaglia added. \u201cAnd she never was.\u201d",

      "\u201cOn top of everything that I was going through, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended our friendship \u2014 I was like, I have to take a step away from this because it was, like, months of me being like, Grace, can you just defend me?\u201d",
      "\u201cI needed her so bad, and I know she needed me too during that year. She felt like I left her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying these are two separate conversations,\u201d she added. \u201cEveryone's saying Grace deserves better, Grace lost her best friend. But I lost my best friend too. ... I brought her along for everything in my life. I gave her everything, and I would do it all over again. ... But when things get hard, and she knew what I was going through, I really needed her.\u201d",

      "O\u2019Malley hasn\u2019t responded to LaPaglia\u2019s claims on the \u201cBFFs\u201d podcast about what she says led to their fallout. According to Portnoy, who\u2019s also the founder of Barstool, he asked O\u2019Malley to come on \u201cBFFs\u201d to explain her side of the story, but she declined.",
      "O\u2019Malley has, however, spoken out about \u201cPlan Bri.\u201d",

I would imagine it might not be because Mel\u2019s a midwife and I think she can still run the birthing center if a clinic closes. But I mean, you can\u2019t close the clinic.",
      "I\u2019m looking forward to watching how Lizzie (Sarah Dugdale) and Denny (Kai Bradbury) deal with being parents at such a young age. I live in the South and people get married here at like, 20, 21 22, 23, 24, 25 and they have kids. It\u2019s very common. I\u2019m personally very happy that I waited until I was 34 to have kids. But I see all these young mothers and they\u2019re just crushing it.",
      "The conversation between Mel and Doc at the hospital after Everett has a heart attack was particularly heart-wrenching, so that was a hard scene to shoot just on an emotional level.",
      "Season 7 of 'Virgin River'",
      "I hope to watch them explore becoming parents and what that looks like for them \u2014 the ups and downs of that journey. I found it to be a really interesting journey myself, becoming a parent. I hope that Mel starts cooking more and gets into farming a little bit. I like that for her. Maybe not so much riding the horse but like having a little garden, some chickens, a little kid running around.",
      "But I think that there\u2019s something about the storyline between Jack and Mel that\u2019s really intriguing. I definitely think that Martin and I had this electric chemistry we really stumbled into. We\u2019re so lucky that we had it because we didn\u2019t chemistry read or anything. We just both got cast and met and there it was. We just were really lucky.",
      "I could go on about it. I think there are a lot of different things at play as to why \"Virgin River\" has gone on. But it\u2019s gorgeous, it\u2019s comforting, people\u2019s storylines are personal and they touch upon things that people are going through. They inspire people. This is what I get from fans when they come up and talk to me about the show.",
      "I\u2019m a big fan of sci-fi, so I always want to be on the sci-fi show. I'm watching \"Silo\" and \"Dune\" right now and I can\u2019t wait to watch \"Dune\" later today because it comes out on Sundays. But there\u2019s nothing\u2019s inspiring me about \"Dune.\" But people get inspired by our show and I think that that\u2019s really special."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"The Six Triple Eight.\"",
      "\u201cNo mail, low morale.\u201d",
      "That was the motto of the 6888th, a battalion that made history in World War II as the first and only Women\u2019s Army Corps unit of color to serve overseas.",
      "The heroic efforts of the battalion are captured in Netflix's \u201cThe Six Triple Eight,\u201d written and directed by Tyler Perry and starring Kerry Washington as the battalion\u2019s commander, Major Charity Adams.",
      "The 6888th was tasked with handling a backlog of over 17 million of pieces of mail, an especially important task at a time when letters were the only way soldiers could interact with loved ones.",
      "\u201cThey were inspiring the soldiers to keep fighting by getting them the letters from home,\u201d Perry said in the film's press notes. \u201cWhen that\u2019s the only way that you can communicate across seas in wartime, it was so important that those soldiers got those letters in their hands. That was life to them.\"",
      "Keep reading to learn more about \u201cThe Six Triple Eight\u201d and the real-life events that inspired the film, which premieres on Netflix Dec. 20.",
      "Who were the Six Triple Eight?",
      "The Six Triple Eight is a nickname for the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only U.S. Women\u2019s Army Corps (WAC) unit of color stationed in Europe during World War II, according to Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "The battalion of 855 women were mostly comprised of Black service members, but also included some women of Caribbean and Mexican descent.",
      "In February 1945, the 6888th was tasked with managing a backlog of over 17 million pieces of mail, sorting letters and packages that filled three aircraft hangars.",
      "It was a formidable job, especially given that so many letters were improperly addressed, or addressed to common names like \u201cRobert Smith,\u201d according to the Buffalo Soldier Educational and Historical Committee.",
      "The women devised an efficient system for sorting the mail and worked round-the-clock shifts in Birmingham, England. They had minimal heating despite freezing conditions and, due to the threat of air raids, they worked in aircraft hangars with blacked-out windows, making visibility difficult.",
      "In addition to the physical challenges, they faced racism and misogyny within the Army. According to the battalion\u2019s historical committee, they were not \u201callowed to sleep, shower or eat in the same facilities as the other female personnel and soldiers.\u201d",
      "The battalion was commanded by Maj. Charity Adams (later Lt. Col. Charity Adams Earley), the first Black woman to serve as an officer in the WAC. By the time the war ended, Adams was the highest-ranking Black woman in the U.S. Army.",
      "The 6888th battalion was given six months to complete their task, but they finished in 90 days. After they completed their mission in England, the battalion was relocated to France.",
      "How accurate is Tyler Perry\u2019s \u2018The Six Triple Eight\u2019 movie?",
      "The movie\u2019s protagonists are based on real people from the 6888th. Kerry Washington\u2019s character, Maj. Charity Adams, was based on the battalion\u2019s real-life leader.",
      "Several moments from the movie are taken directly from documented and real-life events. Washington tells TODAY.com that one of those real-life moments was when Adams was confronted by a superior officer who told her he would send a white officer to show her how to run her unit, to which Adams replied, \"Over my dead body.\"",
      "\"There are so many courageous moments that happened in the script that I then read in (Adams') memoir,\" Washington, who serves as an executive producer on the film, says. \"I think that was like a wonderful surprise to me, that we really were going to be presenting this story in a way that was so rooted in truth and in their lived experience.\"",
      "Washington also shares that similar to the film, Adams was \"threatened with being court-martialed.\"",
      "\"In real life, she was court-martialed,\" Washington tells TODAY.com. \"But because, as she says to the chaplain (in the film), 'I\u2019ve learned these laws and rules of the army inside and out,' she was able to win her court-martial, maintain her status and her position in the army. And she went on to earn multiple degrees on the GI Bill.\"",
      "Lena Derriecott King, played by Ebony Obsidian, was also a veteran of the battalion who helped Perry with his research.",
      "\u201cI met her when she was 99 years old. I didn't know what to expect,\" Perry told Hoda on TODAY Dec. 17. \"I wanted to ask her about the 6888 before I started writing. When she comes down the stairs -- comes down to sit and talk to me, I'm like, 'Is she going to be in the right mind? Is she OK?'\"",
      "Perry said his clear interaction with King quickly washed away all of his concerns. \"99 and sharp as a tack. She told me these incredible stories. Her recall and memory was so great that when I ran it by a historian, he was blown away that she could recall that much.\"",
      "Perry was able to show King a rough cut of the movie before she died at 100 in January 2024, and the filmmaker said she \u201cloved it.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was saluting the screen. She was laughing. But at the end of it, it was so powerful,\u201d he said, according to Netflix\u2019s Tudum. \u201cShe was in tears. She just said, \u2018Thank you so much for letting the world know that we contributed.\u2019\u201d",
      "Several other characters in the film are based on real-life figures,  including Oprah Winfrey\u2019s character, civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune, as well as President Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, played by Sam Waterston and Susan Sarandon.",
      "While much of the film closely follows historical events, Perry revealed he did take one creative liberty toward the end of the film, when the entire battalion is applauded and saluted.",
      "\"That salute didn\u2019t happen. It didn\u2019t happen until many, many, many years later,\" Perry told the audience at a recent screening of the film, attended by TODAY.com.",
      "\"So the liberty that I took at the end was having everyone of them be saluted,\" he continued. \"They all are saluted as they walk in because they represent all 855 to me. And you see them walking through this door into a new life, into a new future.\"",
      "What happened to the Six Triple Eight?",
      "The 6888th disbanded in 1946 and did not receive public recognition in the immediate aftermath of World War II.\u00a0According to Washington, there were even rumors when they returned home that they \"were only sent over to be concubines to the Black soldiers.\"",
      "\"This rumor got started to kind of diminish their legacy,\" Washington tells TODAY.com. \"So a lot of women when they came back, not only were they not celebrated, but they didn\u2019t talk about what they did.\"",
      "In recent years, however, the battalion\u2019s work has been honored on a national level. In 2018, a monument to the 6888th was erected in Leavenworth, Kansas, and in 2022, the battalion was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Six of the members from the battalion who were alive at the time received the honor.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. Army also changed the name of the Fort Lee Army base in Virginia to Fort Gregg-Adams, in honor of Lt. Col. Charity Adams and Lt. Gen. Arthur Gregg, the first Black officer in the U.S. Army to reach the rank of lieutenant general.",
      "As of 2024, there are two remaining members of the 6888th: Fannie McClendon and Anna Mae Robertson."

      "On Dec. 18, Brittany Mahomes uploaded pictures from the get together to Instagram, which included glimpses of Swift and the other attendees in their \u201cEras Tour\u201d outfits. Each guest appeared to dress in costumes similar to the intricate pieces Swift wore onstage that reflected the aesthetics of her 11 albums.",
      "In the first picture, Brittany Mahomes is seen posing alongside her husband in a sequined fringe mini dress with matching knee-high silver boots and a fringed silver and black jacket \u2014 an ensemble that could easily fit in Swift\u2019s \u201cMidnights\u201d or \u201cFearless\u201d eras.",
      "As for the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, there was no denying which Swift album inspired his look. He sported a black suit, matching top hat and white bow tie that made him resemble one of Swift\u2019s dancers during the \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\u201d performance of her concert. His costume was similar to the look teammate Travis Kelce wore in July when he joined his girlfriend onstage during one of her London concerts.",
      "In another photo in the slideshow, Patrick Mahomes sweetly kisses his wife on the cheek.",
      "The rest of the post featured pictures of Swift, who donned a little black dress and an \u201cEras Tour\u201d friendship bracelet on her arm. In one snap, the \u201cFortnight\u201d singer sipped from her drink beside Brittany Mahomes and Lyndsay Bell, wife of former Chiefs tight end Blake Bell, who wore a\u00a0sequined pink long-sleeved dress perfect for the \u201cSpeak Now\u201d or \u201cLover\u201d eras.",
      "For the final photo, Ashley Avignone, longtime friend of Swift, joined the trio and posed with a stuffed toy snake around her neck, an obvious nod to the \u201cReputation\u201d era.",

      "The Season 3 finale of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Ultimatum\u201d ended with two unexpected breakups and two proposals.",
      "In a season that included four early departures and a heated late-night confrontation between two contestants, the finale, out Dec. 18, featured one more chaotic moment that caught a cast member off guard.",
      "On \u201cUltimatum Day,\u201d the final day of the experiment when couples must decide if they want to break up, get engaged or leave with someone new, fans watched contestants Nick Tramontin and Sandy Gallagher unpack their tumultuous time on the show.",
      "During the experiment, Nick, who had issued the ultimatum to Sandy, spiraled while she developed a close bond with fellow contestant Jon Richard \u201cJ.R.\u201d Warren. Nick processed his emotions alone as his trial marriage partner, Vanessa Hattaway, was one of four cast members who quit the experiment in Episode 4.",
      "Sandy tells TODAY.com that Nick tackling the process solo was \u201cdetrimental\u201d to their relationship, which never recovered when the two reunited for their trial marriage.",
      "\u201cIt damaged the whole experience and relationship with Nick and I,\u201d she shares.",
      "Looking back at her time on the Netflix series, she says, \u201cMaybe Nick and I should have left. We should have walked away because it was really challenging and things unfolded in a way that they never had before.\u201d",
      "Despite the two repeatedly expressing their love for each other, she told him on \u201cUltimatum Day\u201d that they still had unresolved issues. She opted to leave alone after he appeared to reach for a ring, ready for a proposal.",
      "But Sandy reveals to TODAY.com that that isn\u2019t what really happened. Below, Sandy shares how their breakup unfolded, in her eyes. She also discusses fans\u2019 reactions to her \u201csurface-level\u201d relationship with J.R., if she has spoken to him or Nick since the show ended, unaired conversations and her biggest regrets.",
      "Somebody actually reached out to me about it, and I had originally said, \u201cNo.\u201d I was like, \u201cNope, that sounds too intense. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re at the place in our relationship where we\u2019re ready to get engaged by any means.\u201d Nick, he perked up. He was like, \u201cNo, I would actually really like to do that with you.\u201d We went through the process, very nonchalant, and we got it. I\u2019m a very firm believer in that everything happens for a reason.",
      "Yes. I think everybody wanted to leave at some point. It\u2019s a really difficult process, specifically when you move in with your trial partner. I know it looks all like rainbows and butterflies with me and J.R, but it was really challenging. First, moving in with somebody new, and being away from your partner, and then having their emotions and reactions mixed with it. It\u2019s really difficult. There were multiple points throughout that I considered leaving, too. But I think when we agreed to it, we committed. That\u2019s kind of the mentality that I had going into it and I think maybe a little too much, honestly. Because there were a lot of things where maybe Nick and I should have left. We should have walked away because it was really challenging and things unfolded in a way that they never had before. We didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Production didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Nobody knew what to do. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing unfold. It was very messy.",
      "That was really upsetting and difficult. Because we\u2019re like, \u201cHow is this going to work if Nick is by himself and I\u2019m in this trial marriage with J.R.?\u201d That\u2019s literally a recipe for disaster on so many different levels. Nick and Mariah had the option to also match up, which, to be honest, they probably should have. Because it was very detrimental that Nick was fully by himself during it. We\u2019re not supposed to be communicating, we\u2019re not supposed to be talking and it just completely spiraled. I was not happy. I wanted Nick to have that experience. I actually wanted to see how it would make me feel to have him in a trial marriage with somebody. (He) and Vanessa really had a legit connection. I don\u2019t know what would have happened if she had stayed. The experiment didn\u2019t go the way it was supposed to go.",
      "I was communicating with Nick. I did see him a couple times and talked to him for hours and hours and hours about everything. Made sure that I was reassuring him. We\u2019ve had a lot of conversations around the whole process. Unfortunately when you get there, immediately you get broken up and you\u2019re in a trial marriage. You have to go through that whole thing before you can then go back with your original partner. So I was trying to let him know, \"We\u2019re really here for the second half of this.\" But I think what unfolded during the trial marriage \u2014 it damaged the whole experience and relationship with Nick and I. We were communicating, but then the communication got very much out of hand on his end. I had to lay boundaries for myself and he was not respecting those boundaries.",
      "I\u2019ve seen him act that way several times in our relationship. It\u2019s a pattern that he has. I know the state that he was in \u2014 emotional, mental, physical \u2014 and I\u2019ve learned to disengage when he\u2019s in that state. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing when I don\u2019t go out and talk to him. Why would I talk to him? He\u2019s intoxicated. He\u2019s very emotional. This is also after \u2014 which we don\u2019t see because this was not caught on camera \u2014 he had called me over 100 times that night and then showed up at the apartment. So it\u2019s like, he\u2019s not respecting my boundaries in the slightest. He\u2019s actually making it almost impossible for me to disengage from that behavior. I knew what was going on because I\u2019ve seen it before many, many times.",
      "Nick is at the door. J.R. immediately goes to the door. He\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t answer it. I\u2019m answering the door.\u2019 They\u2019re getting in a fight over me and I\u2019ve never been in that position before. So that was different, but I\u2019ve seen Nick in that state of mind many times.",
      "It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way \u2014 setting boundaries and sticking to my boundaries. I had these boundaries around (his) level of communication and how it\u2019s unhealthy and inappropriate in a lot of moments. Again, we don\u2019t see that. I do not blame viewers for not understanding because we don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s on my phone. It\u2019s also really difficult for me to deny somebody that I genuinely love and care for so much support when they need it. I would be there for him in a lot of ways and I think that\u2019s maybe what he\u2019s talking about to J.R. at the guys\u2019 night. I (was) expressing to him (that) I love him and I miss him and I want him to be OK. I\u2019m trying to get him through this so we can get to the other side and do our portion together. I don\u2019t really know how to handle the emotions and the behavior sometimes. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s best. I\u2019ve had to learn that through this. Through my relationship with Nick \u2014 before, during and after the show \u2014 genuinely, I\u2019ve learned a lot about setting boundaries and really sticking to it.",
      "Viewers are missing just about everything in terms of me and J.R.\u2019s emotional (and) mental connection. We don\u2019t see it at all. I don\u2019t blame anybody for thinking that me and J.R. (had) a purely surface-level physical connection. Our flirtiness completely outpowers the other stuff that we talked about because it\u2019s just not shown. I get it. It\u2019s OK. It is a TV show and there\u2019s only so much (they) could show. But me and J.R., we had a lot in common. The first conversation that we had, I was like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u2019\u201dWe both have roots in Philadelphia. We both went to the same college, which was a pretty random college. We had the same major in college, which was a very random major. We had a lot of the same beliefs in terms of spirituality, goals and ambitions. I\u2019ve probably talked to J.R. more than I\u2019ve talked to most people about every topic you can think about.",
      "I wouldn\u2019t say it was just a friendship and I didn\u2019t say that it was a friendship. I was trying to explain to her that, \"This is not a real life relationship because this is not a real-life situation. This is an experiment that we\u2019re in.\" Yes, we had a real attraction and connection. I\u2019m not dismissing that. I was just trying to give her reassurance that she quite literally did not ask for, and it was honestly out of line for me to even say anything. I should have just kept my mouth shut. But I was trying to let her know, like, \"We\u2019re not walking out of here together.\" I was trying to give her reassurance in a way that I just didn\u2019t need to. I shouldn\u2019t have.",
      "Me and Zaina actually had a full conversation about that on camera, which we don\u2019t get to see. We do talk through all of it and we clear the air. She knows where I was coming from, but that wasn\u2019t my place to even say that to her. Same thing with the \u201chooking up\u201d comment because we all have different definitions of hooking up, including me and Zaina. Me and J.R. had only kissed a couple times and what I consider hooking up is more than kissing. I was out of line for even saying anything in that space. As a girl, that crushes me because I was not trying to play her. I was trying to be brutally honest, and it came off the wrong way.",
      "Leading up to that, I think we both came to an agreement that it would not be responsible or smart for us to get engaged at that point. There\u2019s a lot more things that we (needed) to work on and things that came up through this process that we\u2019re probably not the right life partners for each other. He had told me that he wasn\u2019t going to propose. So when I saw him reaching in his pocket, I was surprised. That\u2019s why I was like, \"What are you doing?\" Because I didn\u2019t think that he was. He wasn\u2019t reaching for a ring. He was reaching for something else.",
      "It was really hard. It\u2019s really sad, honestly I\u2019ve had such a special relationship with Nick. I\u2019ve had such a special connection and bond with him, and we are so deeply connected. I know it doesn\u2019t look like it, but I love him so much, like, I really, really do. Anybody that knows me, knows our relationship, knows that love was never a problem with us. The love and connection was so deep and strong. It\u2019s the life that that kind of got in the way. I think the \"Ultimatum Day\" was the end, and we both knew it. It\u2019s really difficult to separate from somebody that you still really love and care about. You have that connection with them but you know that they\u2019re not the right life partner for you.\u00a0 I think this whole process expedites the answer. It did bring a lot of things to light, but I think those things would have come to light down the line anyways. What we can uncover in two months is better than taking two years for it to uncover outside of the experience. We got the answers. It just wasn\u2019t the answer that we were hoping for and it was a really weird, hard way to get there.",
      "It was a real breakup. Just like any other marriage or relationship, there\u2019s a separation process. It\u2019s difficult to really emotionally separate from somebody that you are so emotionally tied to. So it was a little bit of a process, but I was feeling this overwhelming gut feeling we (needed) to separate and this (wasn\u2019t) the right relationship for me. It wasn\u2019t healthy anymore. We still supported each other and were there for each other in a lot of ways. I\u2019ll always love him and care for him as a person. That\u2019s way far bigger and beyond this show and this experience. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to date and get married.",
      "No, actually, J.R. and I did not communicate at all after filming the show. I think it was kind of a mutual understanding, and we actually had talked about it during our trial marriage. That\u2019s why I was so confidently telling Zaina, \"This is not a real relationship. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\" I wanted to leave it in the experience. I gave it my all. It\u2019s this unnatural experience that would literally never happen in the normal world. So for me, in my mind and my heart, that was never an option. I was not going to take that with me, Also, out of respect for Nick and Zaina, we never went there.",
      "I have a lot of regrets and lessons (learned) throughout the whole process. I felt this way the last year and now I can actually see it. There\u2019s a lot of things that I would have done differently. I think I made a lot of mistakes along the way. I\u2019m so aware of that. I\u2019m not denying that at all. I think, for one, just my overall kind of the lack of respect that I\u2019m sensing from myself towards Nick, and the resentment that I was carrying from our relationship into the show. That\u2019s pretty apparent to me. Regardless of whatever happened in my relationship, I just don\u2019t want to be showing up for my partner, myself in that way. It\u2019s not who I am to my core. I do think that leaning into the process with J.R. as quick as we did was honestly inappropriate. I don\u2019t think that that was \u2018wrong.\u2019 But for me, my heart and my standards, I don\u2019t think that was respectful towards Nick or Zaina. Looking back now, that\u2019s something that I would have done differently.",

      "The finale, released Dec. 18, was the culmination of a few charged weeks in her relationship with Jon Richard \"J.R.\" Warren.",
      "Zaina, 32, and J.R., 33, were together for three years before going on the show. She issued the ultimatum to him, and in the finale she got her answer. But watching the show has been a bigger revelation, she says.",
      "\"I was completely blindsided by everything,\" Zaina tells TODAY.com in an interview. \"I had no idea who the person that I saw watching it was. I did not recognize J.R. My friends and family are like, 'Who is that man? We don\u2019t know him.' And I just feel like I was completely deceived the entire time, to the point where now the world feels like we were in a fake relationship based off of how he was acting.\"",
      "Read on to find out how Zaina and J.R.'s journey on the show ended and where they stand today.",
      "Do Zaina and J.R. get engaged in the 'Ultimatum' finale?",
      "Zaina and J.R. had trial marriages with Scotty Lewis and Sandy Gallagher, respectively. At first, in the finale, it seemed like the experience caused J.R. to change his mind about marriage.",
      "\"You showed me so much love and care. I want to thank you for that,\" J.R. told Zaina in the finale. \"I wasn't ready to receive it before this.\"",
      "Taking her hands, he told her he thought she'd make a \"fantastic wife and mother,\" and that he envisioned himself giving \"100%\" to make her happy.",
      "\"I can see all that with you,\" he said.",
      "But \u2014 with a revelation timed to the music stopping \u2014 J.R. decided he wasn't at that point to give her what she deserved. He wasn\u2019t the \"rock\" or the \"provider\" he wanted to be. So, he decided to leave the show single.",
      "Zaina seemed at peace with his choice and told J.R. he would be an amazing husband one day. \"Deep down, I just knew you weren't ready,\" she said.",
      "The two both became emotional as Zaina told J.R. she loved him and they shared a kiss. He reciprocated the sentiment. \"You're still my favorite person,\" Zaina said.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about that day, Zaina says she wasn't sure whether J.R. would propose.",
      "\"It was just so hard to tell because the entire trial marriage he kept  saying all the right things to keep me holding on to hope,\" she says. \"I felt like there was a possibility we would have left there together, or at least not gotten engaged and then continued our relationship off in real life.\"",
      "But on \"Ultimatum Day\" she noticed that his body language gave away his decision.",
      "\"He kept backing up. I was like 'Are you trying to actually go into the bushes like Homer Simpson? I\u2019m confused,'\" she says.",
      "What is Zaina and J.R.'s relationship like now?",
      "As far as her current relationship with J.R. goes, Zaina tells TODAY.com that it is \"non-existent.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s unfortunate, because I am a very understanding person. I like to have conversations, and I feel like if he would have taken accountability in any way, shape or form, we could have been cordial. But he avoided any real conversation,\" she says.",
      "The reality television star continues, \"So it\u2019s like almost passing a stranger on the street. We run into each other at events and I don\u2019t even look his way, because everything that happened was so disrespectful to the 10th degree.\"",
      "Zaina says she's happy that \"everything came to light\" and she is at peace with the end of her relationship.",
      "\"It sucks that I had to go through that experience, but I feel like sometimes God has a way of revealing things. And it was clear: J.R. and I were not meant to be together and he needed to be removed,\" she says.",
      "The real shock, Zaina adds, has come in watching J.R.'s relationship with Sandy, his trial marriage partner. On camera, J.R. and Sandy were open about developing feelings for each other and shared two kisses. This, however, was news to Zaina.",
      "\"When we switched back over, J.R. was very much so, like, \u2018Nothing happened. Sandy was the one that initiated everything.\u2019 He was saying all these things to downplay everything to the point where I believed him, and I was just like, 'There\u2019s nothing for me to worry about,'\" she says.",
      "While Sandy had spoken to Zaina about the trial marriage, she says she didn\u2019t know the extent of their relationship until recently.",
      "\"After the show he never gave me closure, or he refused to have real conversations. I didn\u2019t know anything that happened between him and Sandy until last month, before we shot the reunion,\" she says.",
      "Since the show, Zaina has been supported by family, who are \"very upset\" on her behalf.",
      "\"They\u2019re thanking God I\u2019m out of that toxic situation. They\u2019re just pouring a lot of love into me, but also like, \u2018Please, just stay away from him,'\" she says.",
      "At the reunion, which aired Dec. 18, J.R. told his side of the story, saying that Zaina was upset about the time they spent broken up after the show and did not want J.R. to date other people.",
      "\u201cI told her I needed time to process things, and she wanted to go back to what we were doing, and ignore the whole experience, and get back together,\u201d J.R. said. \u201cWe\u2019re not together. I feel like if we really want to realize what we want out of our relationship, we do need to take this time apart. I think you were upset about that.\u201d",
      "Zaina clarified that after their breakup, they lived across the street from each other while continuing to talk and spend time together.",
      "\u201cNaturally, I was really confused and he refused to give me any type of closure,\u201d Zaina said. \u201cI would ask, \u2018OK, during this break, are we seeing other people?\u2019 That\u2019s a valid question to ask. That was asking for clarity. That is not being controlling.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a lot of love for Zaina. I don\u2019t know where all this hostility is coming from. I\u2019ve helped her whenever she called on me. There\u2019s no time where I shut her out,\u201d J.R. responded. \u201cI haven\u2019t given her closure because I\u2019m still processing things.\u201d",
      "Where is Zaina now?",
      "Zaina says she has \"no regrets\" about going on the show and would do it \"a million times over\" because before she was \"blinded to everything.\"",
      "\"I'm just really grateful for the entire experience, no matter how painful it was and how many tears I shed, and how awful the healing journey was,\" she says.",
      "After the show she went on a \"deep healing journey.\"",
      "\"I just started prioritizing myself. I started really leaning into my passions. I left my corporate job to pursue becoming an entrepreneur on my own.  I\u2019m working on building my own wellness brand. Fitness, wellness (and) self care are the three things that I want to prioritize (as well as) mental health,\" she says.",
      "Zaina added that she is also looking forward to sharing her story with others \"to help them identify when it\u2019s time to walk away.\""

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 18:39:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Is The Sticky based on a true story? Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist true story and how it inspired the TV show.",
    "story": [
      "In July 2012, Michel Gavreau was conducting a routine inspection of a maple syrup warehouse near Laurierville, Quebec.",
      "He climbed up a stack of 600-pound barrels, expecting them to support his weight, but when he reached the top, he almost fell.",
      "One of the barrels seemed unbalanced and when Gavreau peered inside, he realized it was empty. As it turned out, many of the surrounding drums were empty, too, and others had been filled with water, according to Vanity Fair's 2016 reporting, which quoted spokeswoman for the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers\u00a0Federation Caroline Cyr's retelling of the story.",
      "This marked the discovery of what came to be known as the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist, a multi-year operation in which a ring of thieves siphoned syrup from thousands of barrels worth millions of dollars.",
      "The heist inspired a new Prime Video series, \u201cThe Sticky\u201d (Dec. 6), starring Margo Martindale as a syrup farmer about to have her land seized by the government.",
      "The comedy-drama is only loosely based on the actual heist and in fact, none of the show\u2019s protagonists are based on the real syrup thieves.",
      "While \u201cThe Sticky\u201d is \u201cabsolutely not the true story\u201d of the heist, as the show\u2019s trailer notes, the series does call fresh attention to one of the most unusual crimes in Canadian history.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the true story of the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist.",
      "Why would people steal maple syrup?",
      "Maple syrup may seem like an odd target for a multimillion dollar heist, but the sweet commodity is big business in Canada.",
      "Canada produces nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s pure maple syrup, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "Syrup harvests vary every year due to climate, tree disease and other factors. To meet the world\u2019s demand for maple syrup, producers created a strategic reserve, where they can stockpile extra syrup in good years and draw from the surplus in bad years.",
      "\u201cIn the States you have the strategic oil reserve,\u201d Simon Tr\u00e9panier, then general manager of the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, now executive director, told The New York Times in 2012. \u201cMother Nature is not generous every year, so we have our own global strategic reserve.\u201d",
      "The strategic reserve allows producers to keep prices stable \u2014 and the prices are not insignificant.",
      "Around the time of the heist, maple syrup was trading for $32 per gallon, or $1,800 per barrel, according to Bloomberg News. (By comparison, a gallon of crude oil in 2012 cost $2.66, according to Statista.)",
      "Throughout the months-long heist, thieves stole syrup from more than 9,500 barrels, with a market value of more than $18 million CAD, or about $12 million USD in 2024.",
      "At his trial, heist ringleader Richard Valli\u00e8res said he sold the stolen syrup for $10 million CAD, making a personal profit of around $1 million CAD, or just over $700,000 USD today, according to BBC News.",
      "\u201cTo steal that amount of maple syrup means you have to know the market,\u201d Tr\u00e9panier told Bloomberg.",
      "How did the thieves pull it off?",
      "In 2011, there was an especially large surplus of maple syrup, meaning that producers had to rent an additional warehouse to stockpile the additional supply.",
      "Here, thieves saw an opportunity. They rented out another section of that extra warehouse under the guise of using it for a different business, which gave them access to the building, according to The New York Times.",
      "Sometimes, the thieves would truck out drums of syrup from the warehouse by night and siphon them into their own barrels, then return the original barrels filled with water, according to Vanity Fair.",
      "Later, the criminals found a way to drain syrup directly from the barrels in the warehouse, without having to cart them away and secretly return them. The syrup would then be trafficked to buyers outside Quebec who allegedly did not realize it had been stolen.",
      "Incredibly, after the theft was discovered, more than 600 barrels of the stolen syrup were recovered in New Brunswick in October 2012, and was transported back to Quebec under police protection, NBC News reported.",
      "At the time, \u00c9tienne St-Pierre, the owner of the New Brunswick export company where the syrup was found, said he had no idea that syrup had been stolen, telling police it had been sold to him by his usual suppliers in Quebec, according to NBC News.",
      "However, it later emerged that St-Pierre was in on the scheme. He was found guilty in 2016 of fraud and trafficking stolen goods, per the CBC.",
      "What happened to the criminals?",
      "Twenty-six people were arrested in 2016 in connection with the maple syrup theft, according to the CBC.",
      "A year later, in 2017, the heist\u2019s ringleader, Richard Valli\u00e8res, was sentenced to nearly eight years in prison and fined more than $9 million CAD, Reuters reported.",
      "He appealed this ruling and had his fine reduced to about $1 million CAD. However, in 2022, Canada\u2019s Supreme Court reversed this appeal, ruling that he should pay the full amount of the value of the syrup he stole, according to BBC News.",
      "Valli\u00e8res\u2019 father, Raymond Valli\u00e8res, was also in on the scheme, according to Canada\u2019s Global News. He was sentenced to two years minus one day in jail and was required to pay about $10,000 CAD within one year.",
      "Others sentenced for their involvement include syrup reseller \u00c9tienne St-Pierre, Avik Caron, whose wife partly owned the warehouse at the center of the heist, and S\u00e9bastien Jutras, a trucker who transported stolen syrup.",
      "Jutras testified at trial that he occasionally collected money from buyers for Richard Valli\u00e8res, saying he once picked up a shoebox full of money that \u201chad to be $200,000,\u201d Canada\u2019s National Post reported in 2017.",
      "He also shared how Valli\u00e8res allegedly justified stealing large quantities of syrup from the FPAQ.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Stealing from thieves is not stealing,\u2019\u201d Jutras testified."

      "\u201cThis moment in my life feels like the beginning of being awake,\u201d the 31-year-old says. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a lot that happened in my life that I was always trying to numb myself to, and for the first time ... I can face whatever it is that comes my way.\u201d",
      "That includes starring in the late Jenni Rivera biopic \u201cJenni,\u201d in theaters and available on the Spanish-language streaming service Vix now. \u201cJenni\u201d tells the tragic and intense real-life story of the late Mexican American regional singer from Long Beach, California, who became one of the leading ladies in a predominantly male-fronted genre.",
      "From her teen pregnancy, musical family upbringing and abusive marriages \u2014 all before her untimely death at 43 in a plane crash \u2014 Rivera was a take-no-BS woman. And she was one who was admired, scrutinized and beloved by many.",
      "Which is why, when offered to audition for the role, Gonzalez says she was \u201cscared s---less.\u201d The team behind the film reached out three times in the span of two months, and Gonzalez kept passing on the opportunity.",
      "\u201cI turned it down because I was like, \u2018Jesus Christ, I don\u2019t know much about her. How am I going to do this?\u2019 Speaking Spanish, the type of music that she does ... that\u2019s not something that I\u2019m familiar with. Culturally, yes, it\u2019s in my ethos, but it\u2019s not something that I grew up around or listening to.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez's team and close friends kept insisting she give the role a shot, including her \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot\u201d co-star Jesse Garcia, who \u201creally convinced me to audition.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnce I read (for the role), I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to book it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s just certain things that click. I think what we do as creatives, as artists, is such a spiritual thing. A lot of times things come to us to break us free, open us up to pieces of ourselves that we never knew, that we didn\u2019t know we could access, or that we needed to.\u201d",
      "The result is a heart-wrenching look at the reality of a young woman who had to physically and emotionally fight back to reclaim her joy, protect her children and make a name for herself. Rivera, who was a mother of five, died Dec. 9, 2012 in a fatal plane crash in Monterrey, Mexico. The accident also claimed the lives of six others.",
      "GONZALEZ ALWAYS knew she wanted to be an actor. Raised by single mother Anna Castillo in Los Angeles and a slew of t\u00edas, Gonzalez \u2014\u00a0who is sixth generation Mexican American \u2014 was surrounded by creatives. Her mom, who also had acting aspirations, had her when she was 23.",
      "\u201cShe was like my big sister,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cWe were little creative babies, and would walk around the house and listen to music and do accents. My babysitters a lot of the time were Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers from watching old movies. It was a lot of daydreaming.\u201d",
      "Her father, Gabriel Gonzalez, is also an actor and musician.",

      "One of Gonzalez\u2019s first auditions was at the age of nine, alongside J.R. Villarreal, who coincidentally co-stars as Rivera's second husband, Juan \u201cCinco\u201d Lopez, in \u201cJenni.\u201d The two hadn\u2019t seen each other in years before reconnecting for the biopic.",

      "Sharaa, who has dropped his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been pushing this line in meetings with Western diplomats and the media since rebel forces, led by his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. As his new administration takes charge, he has also called for the United States and other countries to drop sanctions against Syria.",
      "\u201cNow, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,\u201d Sharaa, dressed in a smart suit and a white shirt, told the BBC in an interview earlier this week, having abandoned the camouflage military fatigues and turban he once wore as a jihadist leader.",
      "\u201cThe victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,\u201d he added.",
      "He has also attempted to move away from his past as a jihadist leader with links to both the Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda.",

      "Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, which barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, the BBC reported that Sharaa said he would be much more inclusive and had pointed to HTS' record in regions it has governed in recent years, particularly in the city of Idlib in Syria\u2019s northwest.",
      "There, he said, universities had been teaching \u201cfor more than eight years,\u201d adding, \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sharaa also promised that a Syrian committee of legal experts would be formed to write a new constitution for the country. \u201cThey will decide. And any ruler or president will have to follow the law,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s saying all of the things that I think Washington and Europe want to hear in terms of a transition leading to a government that\u2019s inclusive and reflective of the will of all Syrians,\u201d said Dana Stroul, a former senior Defense Department official who served in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is, how long that will hold? Will he walk the walk and not just talk the talk? And if he doesn\u2019t win in the elections, will he peacefully stand aside for whoever does win? I think those are big questions,\" added Stroul, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "The Biden administration has said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations \u2014 but that will depend on whether it views Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what they do now and certainly making clear that they want to be inclusive in dealing with other groups inside Syria, making clear that they respect women and minorities as they stand up interim governing authorities \u2014 making clear that Syria won\u2019t be used as a base for terrorist groups,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a briefing Tuesday.",
      "But while many are wary of Sharaa's transformation, throughout Syria's civil war he carved out his own path during his rise to power, defying ISIS and Al Qaeda along the way."

    "summary": "A landmark mass rape trial in France has exposed abuse orchestrated by the victim's husband, and a culture that many activists say is sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 When France\u2019s landmark mass rape trial began Sept. 2, the woman at its center appeared to shrink as she arrived at the stark courthouse in Avignon, her face hidden behind dark sunglasses and surrounded by a cordon of lawyers and loved ones.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, eventually found her voice, bringing into the light not only the inconceivable abuse orchestrated by her husband, who was on Thursday sentenced to 20 years for drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious, but a culture that many activists have called sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
      "Another 46 other men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. They ranged in age from 26 to 74 and were handed sentences from three to 13 years.",
      "Many here say France will never be the same. How could it be, they ask, after so many supposedly ordinary men \u2014 among them a firefighter, a nurse, a journalist and a retired sports coach \u2014 were recorded committing unspeakable acts on a snoring grandmother.",
      "\u201cIt brings us back to the idea of who we are as a society, for normal men to commit acts that are totally transgressive and criminal,\u201d said feminist, lawyer and author Anne Bouillon. With domestic violence complaints in France doubling since 2016, she said, the Pelicot case highlights the fact that women are most at risk at home, threatened by partners.",
      "For Blandine Deverlanges, a high school teacher and founder of the feminist group Les Amazones d\u2019Avignon and a steady presence at the courthouse, the case has tapped a vein.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much larger than the issue of rape. It\u2019s a question of listening to what women have to say.\u201d",
      "Several feminists wondered whether France is in a second wave of the #MeToo movement, which rippled through the film industry here after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s takedown in 2017 but failed to land the same punch on a broader spectrum as in the United States and other countries. France has a history of defending bold-faced men who act badly, such as exiled film director Roman Polanski. Famous French women like the actress Catherine Deneuve didn\u2019t help the cause by signing a letter that denounced sexual \u201cpuritanism\u201d and defended\u00a0men\u2019s \u201cfreedom to pester\u201d women.",
      "But women say the climate feels different this time. Last week, in another closely watched trial seen as France\u2019s first major #MeToo case, Christophe Ruggia, a little-known film director, was charged with isolating and repeatedly sexually assaulting rising star Ad\u00e8le Haenel, beginning when she was 12 and he was 36.  Haenel, now 35, eventually left the industry and denounced adults who failed to help her. He denies the charges; a verdict is expected in February.",
      "With tempers running high over the Pelicot case, activists are hoping to mobilize that outrage into an effort not only to help victims of sexual assault, but also to transform a society in which 75% of women say they are not treated equally, according to a 2024 government study.",
      "\u201cIn France, we haven\u2019t paid much attention to sexual violence,\u201d said Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host who started the organization Femmes Avec to help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault navigate the justice system.",
      "Last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the population of Lille,\u201d R\u00e9us noted, citing the city on the northern border with Belgium.",
      "Much of the discussion has focused on the wording of France\u2019s rape law, which some feminist lawyers say is vague, particularly in cases in which a victim is intoxicated or, like Pelicot, subjected to being drugged,\u00a0known as \u201cchemical submission.\u201d",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted crushing large doses of sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication into his wife\u2019s food and drink. She would discover the truth only in November 2020, weeks after police arrested her husband after he was caught recording up the skirts of women in a supermarket.",
      "Rape is defined under French law as an \u201cact of sexual penetration\u201d committed \u201cby violence, coercion, threat or surprise.\u201d Defense lawyers have insisted that their clients did not intend to commit rape because Dominique Pelicot invited them into the family home, and gave them careful instructions on what he wanted them to do to his wife.",
      "\u201cThis is not American law. In France, you don\u2019t need to have obtained the victim\u2019s consent necessarily to ensure that it\u2019s not rape,\u201d said lawyer Guillaume de Palma, who represents several of the defendants.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d",
      "She said most European countries have adapted their laws and procedures to streamline rape investigations and help victims.",
      "Lafourcade, a veteran magistrate with experience investigating sexual assault cases, was among 500 activists who signed an open letter calling for a consent provision to be added to the law.",
      "But other activists and lawyers say the law is sufficient, with consent implied. Anything more explicit, they say, would force the victim to prove a lack of consent.",
      "Opposing camps do agree on one point: France must overhaul a system that makes it difficult to report sexual violence. From making a police report to following up with a timely medical exam, they agree that it is often a luck of the draw whether a police officer will follow proper procedure or a hospital or an emergency room nurse will agree to take essential DNA samples.",
      "Aurore Hendrickx, 26, a Paris event planner, said she has a few friends who have been sexually assaulted and tried without success to file reports with the police.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, they were almost laughing at them,\u201d she said of the police response, adding that a stunning 90% of her friends have been sexually assaulted or raped. One friend was almost killed by a violent partner.",
      "If police give victims the brush-off, it is often no better at hospitals, where traumatized women are often turned away, advocates say.",
      "Filmmaker Linda Bendali, who has researched cases of chemical submission \u2014 sometimes called date rape \u2014 said a friend\u2019s 23-year-old daughter woke up naked in a strange man\u2019s bed last March with no idea how she got there. Her last memory was sipping a drink in a Paris bar.",
      "\u201cI called the hospital and told them they could see her now. They said, \u2018No, come back tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Bendali said, fuming, adding that she \u201cpushed hard\u201d to demand they take timely blood and hair samples, essential to prove whether the victim had ingested drugs.",
      "While the victim is awaiting a court date, that is a rare occurrence. Only 6% of rape complaints are investigated in France. After that, a trial is conducted behind closed doors \u2014 a process that feminist historian Christelle Taraud called \u201ctruly horrible for the victim,\u201d who is often treated badly by the defense lawyers, with no public accountability.",
      "Taraud called it an \u201celectric shock\u201d when a judge reluctantly approved Pelicot\u2019s demand to keep her trial open, even when intimate videos of her were aired. Finally, Taraud said, the public got to hear and see evidence of the horrific violence inflicted on Pelicot, whose show of strength has made her an international icon.",
      "\u201cThey treated her like a piece of meat,\u201d Taraud said.",
      "In testimony that left many spectators speechless, some of the men appeared to be acting out porn film fantasies. One of them, a former firefighter busted with thousands of images of child pornography, gave a thumbs up to the camera during the assault.",
      "The defendants, who met Dominique Pelicot in a now-defunct online chat room called \u201cwithout her knowledge,\u201d told the five-judge panel that they believed the prone woman was a willing participant. Though her lolling head would seem to indicate otherwise, they called the petite woman, often dressed in lingerie, a swinger acting out a \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d fantasy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Dominique Pelicot said at the start of the trial. Slumped in a glass box, he was separated from the other defendants.",
      "Dominique Pelicot\u2019s cache of 20,000 photos and videos included snaps of his daughter, Caroline Darian, naked in bed. While he has insisted that he did not abuse her, Darian, whose book, \u201cI\u2019ll Never Call Him Dad Again,\u201d will be published in English next month, told the court that she\u2019ll never know what really happened. \u201cDid he also drug me?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWorse still, did he abuse me?\u201d",
      "In her final statement to the court, Pelicot made it clear that she is hoping her humiliation won\u2019t be in vain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape changes,\u201d she said.",
      "The \u201cGis\u00e8le effect\u201d extends beyond Avignon, where the retired logistics manager is applauded and handed bouquets of flowers. Schoolgirls call her name. Strangers send gifts. In a phenomenon that must be deeply satisfying to the woman who wanted \u201cshame to change sides,\u201d activists say women who hadn\u2019t dared speak about domestic violence and sexual assault credit Pelicot with giving them courage to share their stories.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally because of Gis\u00e8le that I have the strength to talk about it,\u201d said Latika, 33, who is still recovering from trauma four years after divorcing a violent husband.",
      "The beatings she said she endured were only part of the story. Latika said she learned the man she met at age 17, the father of her children, had been feeding her drugs for years. Like Pelicot, there were signs something was off, but she didn\u2019t connect the dots. \u201cOne night I didn\u2019t drink all of my tea,\u201d she said, and she awoke to find her husband raping her.",
      "NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate her allegations.",
      "Latika has found solace as part of an \u201cequine therapy\u201d program at Lucky Horse, a 25-acre ranch nestled in the foothills of Mount Ventoux in the picture-postcard village of Mazan, about a mile from the former Pelicot home.",
      "Marion Vogel opened the ranch with her husband, a psychotherapist who has worked with domestic violence survivors, to help women develop \u201clife skills\u201d by working with animals. They ride horses without saddles and stirrups \u201cto connect body to body.\u201d They learn to trust themselves.",
      "First up for Latika was overcoming her fear of horses. She spent half a year building up her confidence tending to an adorable Shetland pony before graduating up to Z\u00e9phyr, a sleek champagne quarter horse with a white slash between his eyes who is now her favorite.",
      "She brushes Z\u00e9phyr\u2019s silky mane and takes him for rides in the same lanes and fields where, Vogel noted, Pelicot used to take long walks.",
      "Like Pelicot, Vogel said, these women \u201call have something to fight for.\u201d"

    "summary": "Winners of six of the last seven English Premier League titles, Manchester City has just one win in their last 10 games in all competitions.",
    "story": [
      "Right now, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has the look of Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus when Rome fell in A.D. 476. He knows his masterpiece is falling, and he is powerless to stop it from crumbling.",
      "Last weekend, Manchester City conceded two late goals in the Manchester derby, or rivalry match, to lose to bitter rivals Manchester United 2-1. City fans inside their Etihad Stadium home sat in near silence. Nobody was angry. They\u2019ve witnessed greatness for almost a decade under Guardiola, but this silence was somber. Absolutely nobody saw this run of just one win in the last 10 games in all competitions coming.",
      "Manchester City has won six of the last seven English Premier League titles and eight of the last 13. It\u2019s a dynasty.",
      "A few months ago it became the only team in English soccer history to win four straight top flight titles. It won the treble (the Premier League, European Champions League and FA Cup trophies) the season before that, becoming just the second team in English history to do so. Everything was going historically well. What could possibly go wrong?",
      "Fast-forward a few months, and City is broken. Badly. It has lost five of its last seven Premier League games. It lost just 11 Premier League games in total over the previous three seasons combined.",
      "This feels like the beginning of the end of Guardiola\u2019s incredible reign as City\u2019s marauding, all-conquering emperor in the most competitive league on the planet.",
      "Can Manchester City snap out of this?",
      "Usually we\u2019d say yes. Given the quality of players it has, the depth of its squad and the manager, after a slow start to a season City usually improves in the second half and kicks on to win trophies.",
      "But this feels different. The current signs aren\u2019t good.",
      "City playmaker Bernardo Silva scolded his teammates for their decision-making late on in the shocking collapse against Manchester United last weekend.",
      "\u201cAt this level, if it\u2019s a game or two, you can say it\u2019s lucky or unlucky, but if it\u2019s 10 games, it is not about that,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of games lately. ... We have to look at ourselves. It\u2019s the decisions that you make. Today, the last minutes, we played like under 15s, and we paid the price.\u201d",
      "And that is the crux of this problem. Guardiola\u2019s \u201ctotal football\u201d philosophy relies on taking risks in possession, piling players forward to have a numerical advantage in the final third and keeping the ball and making good decisions. But what happens when you don\u2019t and you lose the ball?",
      "City always had Rodri, a defensive midfielder just voted the best player on the planet, to plug the gaps, cover cracks, win the ball back and be the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card.",
      "But Rodri went down with a season-ending knee injury in September against Arsenal. That\u2019s when this all started. Rodri\u2019s importance to City was clear, but nobody realized just how much of an impact his injury would have, simply because he has pretty much been ever-present since he arrived from Atletico Madrid in 2019.",
      "City has tried everything to replace Rodri over the last few months, but Guardiola, usually a genius in solving problems with creative solutions, has run out of ideas.",
      "City\u2019s only hope is to sign a sensationally talented defensive midfielder in the January transfer window to plug the Rodri gap. But that would really only paper over the cracks of an aging, injury-hit squad that has so many stars limping over the hill at the same time.",
      "Has a quick collapse like this happened before?",
      "We\u2019ve seen this happen before in European soccer.",
      "Manchester United\u2019s legendary side under Sir Alex Ferguson aged overnight and descended into chaos, and United haven\u2019t won a league title since he left in 2013. Barcelona\u2019s dream team was kept around too long and was left to crumble together as Lionel Messi kept waving his wand to make it seem like an illusion, until it fell apart. Chelsea\u2019s star core eroded quickly in 2011 aside from its sensational last hurrah in winning the Champions League in 2012. Real Madrid\u2019s famed Galacticos wilted in 2008 just as Barcelona\u2019s young stars emerged.",
      "The only saving grace for City is that there is no clear pretender to take its place as the top dog in English soccer. Yet.",
      "Liverpool is early in its new project under new manager Arne Slot. Arsenal appears to have taken a step back this season. Chelsea\u2019s talented young squad is a few years from realizing its potential. Manchester United is in a massive rebuild, again.",
      "Amid all of its struggles this season, City is still within touching distance of the title, and a win this weekend against Aston Villa and a loss for Liverpool at Tottenham would put it just six points off the top.",
      "But from defending better to finding a Rodri replacement to keeping star players fit, it has to knit it all back together at the same time. Now. There can be no more \"under 15s\" decision-making. This topsy-turvy Premier League season has given City a chance to salvage its season.",
      "Over the festive period, City can put itself back in the title race with a favorable schedule before it faces Chelsea and Arsenal in early 2025. If it can navigate the next month without a hiccup, and it still can, there\u2019s a chance City can get itself back in the title hunt. A small chance.",
      "What if Guardiola leaves and chaos ensues?",
      "There is, of course, the possibility that Guardiola, who only just signed a new contract that runs until the summer of 2027, could walk away this season.",
      "He isn\u2019t under pressure from the Abu Dhabi-based owners. Guardiola was the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle when he arrived in 2016. He turned City\u2019s expensively assembled machine into a winning juggernaut while playing soccer in its most beautiful form. Even if City finishes outside the Premier League\u2019s top six this season, it will back Guardiola to rebuild the team and go again. If that is what he wants.",
      "But there is a lot going on at City right now.",
      "It has been charged with 115 breaches of Premier League rules, and that hearing has been going on over the last few months, all while City has been crumbling on the pitch. It\u2019s expected that a verdict will arrive soon.",
      "Guardiola has said multiple times he will stay if City is handed a hefty punishment or even relegated from the Premier League to the lower leagues of English soccer.",
      "But nobody ever factored in that City would be struggling to win a game and look such a mess and that Guardiola might not be good enough for the job. Not our words. His.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not good enough,\u201d Guardiola said after the defeat against Manchester United. \u201cI am the boss, the manager, I have to find solutions, and so far I haven\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far\u201d is the key phrase there, though. It suggests Guardiola, one of the greatest and most successful managers in the history of the game, still believes he can turn this around.",
      "But if this keeps on getting worse, Guardiola may decide to leave before his reputation is tarnished.",
      "City will then be in chaos, with no clear successor lined up and a squad of very talented players all recruited to play in a very specific Guardiola way. Plus, it could be looking for a new manager and rebuilding an aging squad all while uncertainty continues about its future because of those alleged breaches of Premier League rules.",
      "Amid this horrendous run of form for one of the greatest teams soccer has ever seen, there is a very real fear among Manchester City fans that things are about to get a lot worse. When a team starts to crumble like this, it happens very suddenly, and there isn\u2019t a quick fix.",
      "City\u2019s fan base has a notoriously downbeat outlook on the team, and that remains despite all the winning in recent years. But if Guardiola leaves and City\u2019s season descends into chaos on and off the pitch, the gallows humor its fans are famous for will intensify. And it might not mask the pain of what is about to come.",
      "The next few weeks are crucial on and off the pitch in determining how Guardiola\u2019s reign will come to an end. Whatever happens this season, he and City can say quite confidently \u201cveni, vidi, vici\u201d when all is said and done.",
      "For now, one of soccer\u2019s great dynasties is limping on."

      "The haul of new species was also accompanied by another 48 species that are potentially new to science but require further analysis, the report said.",
      "\u201cOverall, the RAP team encountered exceptionally high levels of biodiversity that far exceeded expectations considering most of the study sites were located near communities and towns,\u201d the report said, adding that the findings \u201chighlight the importance of research and conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes.\u201d",
      "In addition to the amphibious mouse and unusual-looking catfish, scientists discovered another type of mouse with stiff, spiny fur and a squirrel only distantly related to others known by science, as well as a new bat and several types of fish, butterflies and amphibians.",
      "While discovering new species of insects and even fish is not uncommon, the most significant takeaway from the report is the documentation of new mammals, said Chris Jiggins, an evolutionary biology professor at Britain's University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing \u2014 to find four new species of mammals unknown to science is pretty impressive. The amphibious mouse is something I\u2019ve never heard of. It\u2019s quite extraordinary,\u201d Jiggins told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday.",

      "The illness was considered a mystery for weeks. It has killed at least 37 people and sickened 592, according to the Africa CDC. Local authorities previously told Reuters that the death toll exceeded 140.",
      "Health officials in Africa have been referring to the illness as \u201cDisease X\u201d while awaiting test results.",
      "The Africa CDC said Thursday that lab tests of samples taken from 51 people suggest that a malaria outbreak may be behind the cases. Concurrent health issues among the population, such malnutrition and known viral infections, could exacerbate the illnesses. (Malaria is caused by a parasite that\u2019s spread by mosquitoes.)",
      "\u201cThe diagnosis is leaning more toward malaria,\u201d Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, principal adviser to the director-general of the Africa CDC, said at a news briefing.",
      "Congo\u2019s health ministry told Reuters this week that malaria was the culprit: \u201cThe mystery has finally been solved. It\u2019s a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness,\u201d it said Tuesday in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "The ministry did not respond to multiple inquiries from NBC News.",
      "The World Health Organization said testing is ongoing and that it has not confirmed a diagnosis yet. The organization suggested Dec. 8 that malaria could be causing or contributing to the cases. Two days later, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 initial samples collected from sick people in the region had tested positive for malaria.",
      "Ngongo said in the Thursday briefing that the Africa CDC still has not ruled out a secondary hypothesis that some kind of viral infection \u2014 combined with malaria and malnutrition \u2014 is largely responsible for the illnesses. Ngongo said that one person who died experienced symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, a life-threatening condition associated with viral infections.",
      "The cases are in a rural part of Kwango province in southwestern Congo, which has limited access to laboratory testing and is difficult to reach by road, according to the WHO. The agency said it takes 48 hours to get to the province from the capital city, Kinshasa.",
      "Malnutrition rates in the province are high, the WHO added, which can make people more vulnerable to serious illness.",
      "Children, particularly those under 5, make up the majority of cases connected to the outbreak.",
      "The most commonly reported symptoms have been fever, headaches, coughing, difficulty breathing and anemia, according to the Africa CDC, with particularly severe symptoms among children.",
      "Malaria is the leading cause of death in Congo, resulting in more than 24,000 deaths each year. It also accounts for 19% of deaths among children under 5 in the country, according to the United States Agency for International Development.",
      "Malaria is caused by a parasite that Anopheles mosquitoes carry; it can spread to humans through bites. Mosquito nets, insect repellant and antimalarial drugs can help limit transmission, and receiving a malaria vaccine prior to infection can reduce the odds of severe disease and death.",
      "Dr. Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC, said in a news briefing last week that the outbreak constituted a \u201cmajor public health issue,\u201d given how many cases had been reported in a short time.",
      "In a briefing Dec. 5, Kaseya noted that limited surveillance and laboratory resources had caused a five- to six-week delay in national health authorities being notified of the illnesses after patients first started experiencing symptoms.",
      "If malaria is the culprit, there may have been ways to rapidly detect it locally, said Amira Albert Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University.",
      "\u201cHealth care providers could have detected it by taking small blood samples and looking at them under the microscope,\u201d Roess said. \u201cAll local clinics should have light microscopes and personnel who are trained to use them to detect malaria and other parasites.\u201d",
      "A local WHO team has been helping health authorities in Kwango province identify cases since the end of November. The U.S. CDC has also provided technical assistance.",
      "Congo\u2019s health ministry has issued a public statement instructing people not to handle the remains of anyone who died after experiencing flu-like symptoms without the involvement of authorized health authorities. The ministry also advised people to avoid mass gatherings and report any suspicious illnesses or unusual deaths."

    "story": [
      "Dozens of men, including the ex-husband of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, were found guilty Thursday of raping and sexually assaulting her in a historic trial that shocked France.",
      "Speaking with journalists in the southern town\u00a0of Avignon after the verdicts were read, Pelicot, 72, said the outcome of her case gave her faith in a future in which \u201ceverybody, women, men can live together in harmony, in respect and in mutual understanding.\u201d",
      "Pelicot, who has become a hero to many in France for\u00a0choosing to waive her right to anonymity and highlight the crimes orchestrated by her husband, added that she had fought the case with her children and her grandchildren in mind \u201cbecause they are the future,\u201d according to a live translation by NBC News\u2019 British broadcasting partner, Sky News.",
      "Earlier in the courtroom, she watched as Roger Arata, the lead judge, sentenced her husband, Dominique Pelicot, to 20 years in prison. He had admitted to drugging her until she became unconscious and inviting dozens of men to rape her over the span of a decade.",
      "Another 46 men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault in the high-profile case, according to Sky News. They ranged in age from 26 to 74 and were handed sentences from three to 13 years. Collectively, they will serve more than 400 years.",
      "Around 15 had admitted to the facts, although only a handful of the men accused expressed remorse in the lead-up to their verdicts.",
      "In a side room, family members of the defendants watched the proceedings unfold on television screens, with some bursting into tears and gasping as the sentences were revealed, The Associated Press reported.",
      "With emotions running high, some 200 police officers were deployed in and around the courthouse, which was packed with family members of the accused, spectators and journalists from around the world. More than 150 journalists were accredited to cover the trial, which many activists see as a watershed moment\u00a0for women\u2019s rights in France.",
      "Pelicot said she respected the court and its decisions.",
      "While each of the 51 men tried in the case were found guilty, outside the court campaigners against sexual violence said their sentences fell short of what was required.",
      "Calling the terms far too lenient, Marion Vogel, who runs a therapy program for domestic violence and other trauma victims in Mazan, the village where the Pelicots lived, said, \u201cShame hasn\u2019t really changed camps to include the courts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely essential for this high-profile trial to set an example and deliver deterrent sentences, so that every man\u2019s mind would be marked by it, and our society could finally evolve,\u201d she added.",
      "Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host whose organization, Femmes Avec, helps victims navigate the justice system, also said it was \"not a real punishment for most of these men.\u201d",
      "In an earlier hearing, it was revealed that Pelicot only learned of the horrors she endured when police started an investigation into her husband after a security guard caught him filming up the skirts of women with his smartphone.",
      "Investigators told they had found videos on her husband\u2019s devices that suggested she herself had been the victim of a major crime.",
      "While she could have remained anonymous, she called for the trial to be held in public and she instructed her lawyers to fight for harrowing video and other evidence to be played out in open court.",
      "She has previously said she was doing this in a bid to put an end to the \u201cmacho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape.\u201d",
      "Campaigners against sexual violence had been hopeful that Pelicot's case would represent a turning point in the fight against rape culture and in the difficulties that sexual assault survivors often face in obtaining justice.",
      "And in France, some of them told NBC News this week that they hoped to transform a society in which 75% of women said they believe they are not treated equally in a 2024 government study, and where last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the\u00a0National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d"

      "Since the civil war in Syria erupted in 2011, hundreds of thousands of political prisoners disappeared into Assad\u2019s sprawling network of prisons and many were tortured and killed.",
      "Both Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who died in 2000, have been accused by human rights groups of massacring and abusing their fellow Syrians.",
      "But after the\u00a0downfall of the Assad regime, thousands of prisoners who had been held captive for years have been released. But there still has been no sign of Tice.",
      "A former prisoner\u00a0told NBC News in the last few weeks that he was held captive in a cell across the hall from Tice and saw him alive as recently as July 2022.",
      "But while NBC News has not been able to independently confirm that account, Debra Tice said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cwe were able to verify that he was\u201d there in 2022."

      "\u201cDuring the interrogation, he explained that he was recruited by the Ukrainian special services,\u201d Svetlana Petrenko, a spokesperson for Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOn their instructions, he arrived in Moscow and received a homemade explosive device. He placed it on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance to the residential building where Igor Kirillov lived,\u201d she added.",
      "Tuesday's assassination was the latest in a long line of acts of sabotage and covert killings to hit Russia as its war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "At the site of the explosion Wednesday, bent metal and bricks had been blown from the walls, and blood remained in the snow. As people and cars passed by on the busy street where Kirillov lived, some left red roses.",
      "The suspect rented a car and \u201cinstalled a video surveillance camera\u201d so he could broadcast the video online, Petrenko said, adding that the man was from Uzbekistan and in his 20s.",
      "State media, citing video from the FSB \u2014 Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency \u2014 identified the suspect, whom authorities did not name, as Akhmad Kurbanov.",

      "While the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, its first land grab came in 2014.

    "story": [
      "Many women are surprised by how much pain they experience during a medication abortion, a study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health found.",
      "More than 60% of abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions, meaning a person takes two drugs, often at home, to end a pregnancy. The study, which surveyed women in the U.K., found that many don\u2019t feel prepared for the amount of pain they may feel during the procedure.",
      "Pain does not mean the procedure is unsafe, but some women may feel caught off guard based on the information health providers gave them.",
      "\u201cThere is a bit of a reckoning in the world of gynecology right now and the pain patients are experiencing during procedures,\u201d said Dr. Alyssa Colwill, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.",
      "In the study, researchers looked at survey responses from about 1,600 women in the U.K. who had undergone a medication abortion and then answered questions about the experience. Most were between the ages of 20 and 39 and half had never given birth.",
      "More than 90% of respondents ranked their pain at least a 4 out of a maximum of 10, and about half said the pain was more than they had expected. About 40% said their pain was severe, between an 8 and a 10 on the pain scale.",
      "Women are often told to expect cramping akin to strong menstrual cramps during a medication abortion, both in the U.K. and in the U.S. While some respondents felt that was an accurate description, others said they felt unprepared and that the pain aspect of medication abortion was \u201csugar-coated\u201d or downplayed.",
      "One woman who responded to the survey said: \u201cPain was so much stronger than period pain, it was like having contractions in labour. I\u2019ve given birth three times and the pain really wasn\u2019t too much different from that pain, the cramping contraction pain.\u201d",
      "Another said: \u201cI think it\u2019s worth reassuring people that just because it [pain] is stated severe it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will be. I spent more time worrying about the possibilities of the side effects than needed!\u201d",
      "The researchers concluded that women wanted detailed, realistic pain counseling and general preparatory advice, including details from firsthand experiences that illustrate the range of pain women may experience during medication abortion.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is the acknowledgement that everyone\u2019s experience of pain during a medical abortion will be different,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Hannah McCulloch, an evaluation researcher at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be realistic about what women experience during medical abortion in order to provide meaningful patient-centred care.\u201d",
      "Medication abortions involve taking two pills. The first, mifepristone, blocks the hormone progesterone, which is critical for a pregnancy to continue. One or two days after taking mifepristone, the person takes a second drug \u2014 usually misoprostol \u2014 which causes the uterus to cramp and soften and the cervix to dilate so the pregnancy can pass, usually within 24 hours of taking misoprostol, according to Colwill.",
      "\u201cThat process, the uterus having to cramp and expel the pregnancy, inherently is going to cause pain,\u201d she said, adding that many factors play into how much pain each person feels.",
      "Women who may report less pain with a medication abortion include those who have experienced labor or given birth vaginally and women who have painful menstrual cramps every month, such as those who have endometriosis, Colwill said.",
      "\u201cUnderstanding these past experiences, and things like how they experience Pap smears and vaginal exams, can help us better support patients to be prepared for how pain may be for them,\u201d she added, noting that she was not surprised to see many women did not feel they were adequately prepared to manage pain during a medication abortion.",
      "Medication abortion is an extremely safe procedure. Serious side effects occur in less than 0.5% of people who take Mifeprex, the brand-name version of mifepristone, according to the drug\u2019s label, and the number of women managing their own abortions has increased since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cPatients need to be adequately informed about what to expect and be told what we know about how to manage the pain. Pain is downplayed in medicine in general and particularly in women\u2019s health and obstetrics and gynecology,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of advancing new standards in reproductive health at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "Even if a person accesses abortion medication through telehealth, Grossman said people should still be counseled on what to expect and how to treat the intense pain and nausea that can happen during the procedure. His best advice, he said, for managing pain during a medication abortion is to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, such as ibuprofen, at the same time as misoprostol. If possible, he recommends also taking an anti-nausea medication such as metoclopramide, which requires a prescription.",
      "Colwill said that acetaminophen, or Tylenol, is also an option, but NSAIDs do a better job of blocking this specific pain.",
      "Putting a heating pad, a hot water bottle or over-the-counter trans-electrical nerve stimulation pads on the lower belly can also help \u201cconfuse\u201d nerves in the area and help relieve pain,\u00a0Grossman said.",
      "He said it\u2019s also important to understand what pain is \u201cnormal\u201d and when it may be time to seek medical help, especially in situations where people are at home.",
      "Pain in the middle of the lower abdomen is normal, for example, but pain higher up or pain just on one side could be a sign that something is wrong, such as an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus.",
      "If someone experiences severe pain on one side of the abdomen or pelvis, they should go to the emergency room, Grossman said. \u201cIf they have mild to moderate pain on one side, they might try to talk to a clinician first by phone. But if there\u2019s any question, they should go to an emergency department,\u201d he added.",
      "Ectopic pregnancies are detected on ultrasounds, however, \u201cmany people have a medication abortion without having an ultrasound and it can even be missed on an ultrasound,\u201d Grossman said.",
      "Medication abortion will not work for an ectopic pregnancy, according to the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Pain beyond 24 hours after a pregnancy is passed, especially if the person also has a fever or is vomiting, could be a sign of infection, he said.",
      "Women should also not discount the importance of moral support, he added: \u201cFeeling supported and having someone there makes a big difference, too.\u201d"

      "Nonetheless, Andrew forged a relationship of \u201csignificant degree\u201d with Yang, marked by an \u201cunusual degree of trust,\u201d the court ruling said, adding that he was \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with the Chinese national, whom he invited to his 60th birthday party in 2020.",
      "Yang could reportedly \u201cact on behalf\u201d of the prince in engagements with potential partners and investors in China, the ruling said.",
      "Andrew\u2019s office said in a statement that he\u00a0\u201cceased all contact with the individual after concerns were raised.\u201d It added that he \u201cmet the individual through official channels with nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed.\u201d",
      "Yang also sought connections with \u201cprominent U.K. figures,\u201d including politicians, which could be \u201cleveraged\u201d for political interference by China, the court said.",
      "Yang was considered a \u201crisk to national security,\u201d prompting former Secretary of State Suella Braverman to conclude in March 2023 that the ban on his entry to Britain was \u201cjustified and proportionate,\u201d the ruling added.",
      "Pictures of Yang alongside former British Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron have been published in U.K. news outlets, although it is unclear when and where the meetings took place.",
      "In his statement, Yang said that he had \u201cdone nothing wrong or unlawful\u201d and that the concerns raised by Britain\u2019s Home Office \u201care ill-founded.\u201d",
      "For the royal family, it is another embarrassing revelation about Andrew, a onetime war hero who served in Britain\u2019s Royal Navy and flew a number of missions during the 1982 conflict with Argentina over the remote\u00a0Falkland Islands.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a\u00a0civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleges Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17.",
      "Giuffre has long alleged she was forced in the 1990s to have sex with Andrew after notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his\u00a0confidant, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, trafficked her to him. Maxwell, 62, was jailed for 20-years after a jury concluded that she played a pivotal part\u00a0in recruiting and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.",
      "Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "There have also been several high-profile spy cases involving China in the U.S.",
      "Federal prosecutors this year charged Linda Sun, a former top aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering.",
      "Sun, 41, used her position to aid Chinese officials and covertly sharing internal documents with Beijing, prosecutors alleged in court papers. She was also accused of blocking Taiwanese diplomats from contacting the state government.",
      "In return, Sun received millions of dollars in transactions for the China-based business activities of her husband, Chris Hu, a job for her cousin in China and tickets to various sporting and cultural events, the indictment said.",
      "Hu was charged with money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misuse of means of identification.",
      "Both have pleaded not guilty."
