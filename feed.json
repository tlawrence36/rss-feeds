      "A jury of five men and seven women has been seated at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is charged with firing a gun at a former friend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A jury of five men and seven women was seated Thursday at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is charged with firing a gun at a former friend in 2021.",
      "Opening statements at the Los Angeles trial of the 36-year-old hip-hop superstar and fashion maven will likely begin Friday after the 12 jurors were selected. Four alternates still need to be selected.",
      "Rocky turned down a prosecution plea offer of 180 days in jail to risk years in prison if the jurors find him guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer says he committed no crime.",
      "He opted instead to risk trial on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with conviction bring a penalty of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "It took the two sides 2 1/2 days to pick the jurors from a pool of more than a hundred candidates who packed into a downtown LA courtroom. Those chosen include a woman who is a podcast editor and actor, and a man who has worked for more than 20 years at Trader Joe's.",
      "Many were excused for cause, others sent away by one of the two sides. Each had 10 jurors they could excuse without a reason. The defense used seven of their challenges, the prosecution just two.",
      "One man questioned Thursday works as a civilian with the Los Angeles Police Department and has extensive ties to law enforcement including a cousin who was on the case's witness list but is not expected to be called.",
      "After the judge declined to dismiss him for cause, Rocky's lawyer Joe Tacopina took him off the jury.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a shocker, we\u2019re going to thank and excuse juror number 27.\u201d",
      "Attitudes toward police were a common topic during jury selection. In a heated moment, Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold, a former sheriff's deputy, questioned those who said they mistrusted police, nearly debating with some of them.",
      "He asked one woman, a speech pathologist, whether he should mistrust all speech pathologists based on his bad experience with one.",
      "When another woman brought up police corruption, Arnold demanded she \u201ctell me about the documented corruption at LAPD that you must\u2019ve either read about or heard.\u201d",
      "When she brought up the Rodney King case, he asked, \u201cYou are going to hold against current police something that happened before they were born?\u201d",
      "Many questions were about the fame of both Rocky and especially Rihanna, his longtime life partner and the mother of his two toddler children. She was not in court Thursday, and it's not certain whether she will show up during the trial.",
      "\u201cWhat if Rihanna comes here to court, is it going to be hard for you to look over there, and see the defendant\u2019s family, and deliver a guilty verdict?\u201d Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked one woman.",
      "After a long pause, she said \u201cyes.\u201d",
      "Rocky is accused of firing three or four shots at Terell Ephron, a friend from his teenage years, on the streets of Hollywood in 2021. Ephron said the shots grazed his knuckles. Rocky has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers say he wasn't even holding a real gun, but a starter pistol he used as a prop."

      "The film academy had plenty of surprise nominations Thursday for the 97th Oscars",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- In one of the more wide-open Oscar fields in recent history, there were plenty of nominations surprises Thursday.",
      "Not too long ago, it seemed that people like Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman were destined for best actress nominations, while general audience disinterest in the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d might have indicated its awards chances were dead on arrival.",
      "But the members of the film academy had something different in mind. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the 97th Oscar nominations.",
      "The young Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d has been one of the bigger awards season question marks, especially after it failed to resonate with moviegoers in theaters. And yet both Jeremy Strong, for his portrayal for Trump lawyer Roy Cohn, and Sebastian Stan (who was also in the conversation for \u201cA Different Man\u201d ), for playing the future two-time president, made it in. Only Strong got nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.",
      "This will forever be one of the more confounding awards season oversights. Marianne Jean-Baptiste delivered one of the all-time great performances in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths,\u201d as the perpetually aggrieved and sharp-tongued London woman Pansy. The general thinking is that it was either going to be Jean-Baptiste or Fernanda Torres, and Torres got in for the equally beloved \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "This is perhaps up for debate, but there was certainly a lot of goodwill behind Anderson\u2019s movie-star turn in Gia Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d especially considering her SAG nomination. But like with Jennifer Lopez and \u201cHustlers\u201d a few years ago, it was not meant to be at the Oscars.",
      "James Mangold has directed several awards darlings, including \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d and \u201cWalk the Line\u201d but had consistently missed out on a best director nomination, until this year with \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d It may have come at the expense of Edward Berger, who missed out on a nod for \u201cConclave\u201d or Denis Villeneuve for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "Daniel Craig gave one of his best performances as an American expat in Mexico in the torrid May-December romance in \u201cQueer,\u201d but it hasn\u2019t been resonating with awards voters. The Oscar snub is the final piece in a puzzle that just never came together.",
      "If there ever were a shoo-in for a nomination and an Oscar, on paper at least, it would be for Angelina Jolie playing opera legend Maria Callas. Filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn had not missed yet in getting best actress nominations for his famous, tragic women biopics, including Natalie Portman for \u201cJackie\u201d and Kristen Stewart for \u201cSpencer.\u201d But somehow Jolie did not make the cut in the end.",
      "\u201cBabygirl\u201d is not a cliche awards movie by a long stretch, but Nicole Kidman\u2019s performance as Romy, the buttoned-up, married CEO who begins a dangerous affair with a young intern at her company was undeniable. But a best actress win at the Venice Film Festival has never guaranteed Oscar success.",
      "Despite the wide love for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Felicity Jones has been curiously absent from many nominations lists for her sharp portrayal of Erzs\u00e9bet T\u00f3th. The cast did not even get recognized by SAG. But it just goes to show that it\u2019s never too late to sneak in for the big one",
      "A few years after Danielle Deadwyler was famously snubbed for \u201cTill,\u201d she has another snub to add to her resume for Malcolm Washington\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d This latest campaign might not have had as much steam behind it as \u201cTill,\u201d but at the very least one would assume that it could have been a make good.",
      "Supporting actress was one of the more chaotic and unpredictable categories this year, with so many deserving performers in the mix. Monica Barbaro was one of those that was on the fringe of possibilities for her turn as Joan Baez, singing and all, for \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "One who was not so lucky was Selena Gomez for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d perhaps because she was partially competing with her co-star, Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a who simply had more momentum (and gave a moving speech at the Golden Globes).",
      "The incarceration drama \u201cSing Sing\u201d did get several significant nominations including for Colman Domingo, adapted screenplay and original song. But Clarence \u201cDivine Eye\u201d Maclin, who delivered a revelatory performance based on his own experience, was not among them. He is, however, credited with helping to write the story.",
      "Margaret Qualley seems to have been unfairly left out of much of the awards conversation around \u201cThe Substance,\u201d a movie that only works with a great Sue. But the focus has been more on Demi Moore, overdue for such recognition, and Coralie Fargeat \u2014 the only woman to score a best director nomination.",
      "Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross delivered one of their most popular scores ever this year for \u201cChallengers\u201d and yet were left off in a batch of nominees that included \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d It\u2019s not even that they\u2019re consistently overlooked by the academy \u2014 they\u2019ve already won twice, for \u201cSoul\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d",
      "Everyone expected the Latvian cat movie \u201cFlow\u201d to get a best animated feature nomination, especially after it won the Golden Globe. But the big surprise is that it got a second for best international feature \u2014 a first for Latvia. This is not a first for an animated movie to get into the international category, though: \u201cWaltz with Bashir\u201d and \u201cFlee\u201d had the honor before \u201cFlow,\u201d but neither ended up winning.",
      "RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has had quite the rollercoaster awards season journey, even though it\u2019s widely considered one of the best films of the year. The film academy thought so too, including it among the 10 best picture nominees (alongside other relative surprises like \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d). Oddly, though, it missed out on cinematography despite its inventive first-person point of view."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival catalogue can be overwhelming to navigate, with around 90 feature films playing across 11 days.",
      "This year the Robert Redford-founded independent film festival has something for everyone: Comedies, dramas, horrors, documentaries, the intriguingly undefinable (there\u2019s a movie about cabbage smuggling called \u201cBubble & Squeak\u201d and one in which a woman becomes a chair and everyone likes her better that way called \u201cBy Design\u201d).",
      "Here are a few of the films we\u2019re looking forward to most:",
      "This is a film that the producers would rather audiences experience blind, but the brief synopsis is that Alia Shawkat plays an aspiring actress in a military role-playing facility who falls for a soldier playing an insurgent. Luca Guadagnino produced the film, written and directed by Hailey Gates. It also stars Callum Turner and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. When asked how she likes to describe the film, Gates told The Associated Press that, \u201cSometimes I describe it as a military industrial complex romantic comedy.\u201d",
      "This film delves into the life of a Chinese-American \u201ccam girl,\u201d kind of a virtual sex worker, who is navigating a toxic relationship with a client while attempting to repair her relationship with her dying father. Katarina Zhu wrote, directed and stars in the film, alongside Rachel Sennott.",
      "Pulitzer Prize-winner Mstyslav Chernov took audiences into the first days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the Oscar-winning \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d and is back with another dispatch from the ongoing war. In \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between the AP and Frontline, Chernov turns his lens to Ukrainian soldiers attempting to traverse one mile of forest to reclaim the occupied village Andriivka. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, horrifying portrait of the futility of war,\u201d said Kim Yutani, the festival\u2019s director of programming.",
      "Steven Soderbergh produced this film from first time filmmaker Rachael Abigail Holder about three Brooklynites navigating relationships and a changing city. Andr\u00e9 Holland stars alongside Nicole Beharie and DeWanda Wise.",
      "This is a documentary about a failed attempt to make documentary about the Zodiac Killer, from filmmaker Charlie Shackleton. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many cases as puzzling as that of the Zodiac Killer, despite half a century of clues compiled in countless true crime TV shows, podcasts and books,\u201d Shackelton wrote. He walks the viewer through what could have been in this film that fell apart in this meta commentary on the ubiquitous true crime genre.",
      "Clint Bentley, who co-wrote \u201cSing Sing,\u201d directs this adaptation of a Denis Johnson story about a day laborer working the railroads in the early 20th century, starring Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones. In his director\u2019s statement, Bentley said, \u201cIt\u2019s about the people left behind by modernization. It\u2019s about the toll industrialization takes on the natural world. It\u2019s about the possibilities love can open up in our lives and about the hope that can blossom in the aftermath of grief.\"",
      "Black generational farmers in rural Georgia are the subject of this black-and-white documentary from first time filmmaker Brittany Shayne. The film shines a spotlight on their struggle to maintain their land amid discriminatory government policies.",
      "This Norwegian film about a fairy tale kingdom and stepsisters competing to be the most beautiful for the prince has been described, intriguingly, as \u201cThe Substance\u201d meets \u201cBridgerton.\u201d Writer and director Emilie Blichfeldt could be poised to join Coralie Fargeat and Julia Ducournau as filmmakers reinventing the body horror genre from a female gaze.",
      "A neighborhood dispute in Florida turns deadly in this inventive film from Geeta Gandbhir, constructed largely with police bodycam footage, which examines the state\u2019s \u201cstand your ground laws.\u201d",
      "Barry Jenkins produced this film from writer-director-star Eva Victor, which is reason enough to take note. \u201cThere are scenes in this film that I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cI was struck by this film because of the way that this filmmaker chooses to tell the story and framing her character\u2019s trauma through a very innovative way of storytelling. It was a real revelation to see.\u201d",
      "Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson won an Oscar for his portrait of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival in \u201cSummer of Soul,\u201d and now he\u2019s back and focused on one of the performers that day: Sly Stone. This new film grapples with the question of the burden of Black genius (also its title) as it tells the story of his rise, his cultural influence and his struggles with drugs. Elegance Bratton is also debuting an accidental companion doc, \u201cMove Ya Body: The Birth of House.\u201d",
      "Also of note among music-themed documentaries: Amy Berg\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley\u201d; Kevin MacDonald\u2019s \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d a Venice film that\u2019s getting a spotlight showing at Sundance; Isabel Castro\u2019s \u201cSelena y Los Dinos\u201d about Selena Quintanilla.",
      "Filmmaker Rashad Frett looks at life after incarceration through the character Ricky (Stephan James), who was locked up in his teens and is now 30-years-old trying to rebuild his life. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly moving story about family and how he\u2019s reintegrating into society and just the real struggles that he is going through in that process,\u201d Yutani said.",
      "Olivia Colman and John Lithgow play father and daughter in this LGBTQ-themed film from Sophie Hyde (the filmmaker behind \u201cGood Luck to You, Leo Grande\u201d ). It revolves around a visit to Amsterdam with her non-binary teenager to stay with Lithgow\u2019s character, who is gay. \u201cThe way that these two truly gifted actors are able to portray the love and the tension, you really trust that they\u2019re depicting characters who have a long complex life together,\u201d festival director Eugene Hernandez said.",

      "Dozens of jurors will return to a Los Angeles courtroom for the possibility of serving on the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is charged with firing a gun at a former friend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge said he expects a jury will be chosen at the trial of A$AP Rocky on Thursday, while lawyers for the hip-hop star are protesting the dearth of Black candidates for the panel.",
      "Nearly one hundred potential jurors will pack into the Los Angeles courtroom for a third long day of questioning at the trial, where Rocky is accused of two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for allegedly firing on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.",
      "Opening statements will begin once 12 of them, and four alternates, are seated.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to have a jury tomorrow,\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold said at the end of court Wednesday, thanking the panelists for their patience. \u201cThis is not going to go on forever.\u201d",
      "Other than dismissals for cause, each side can have 10 jurors dismissed without giving a reason. The defense has used four of its challenges. Prosecutors used just one. They said they are happy with the jury as currently composed. But that may change.",
      "Meanwhile, lawyers for Rocky said they planned to appeal a judge's rejection of their request for a hearing on why less than 5% of the jury pool is Black, while the area they are drawn from is 9% African American. It's possible that none of the 16 jurors selected will be Black.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re troubled by that to say the least,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said. \u201cWe\u2019re in downtown Los Angeles, not a small town in Montana.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors questioned potential jurors Wednesday about their attitudes toward police and celebrity.",

      "He asked them whether they'll worry about the effect that convicting Rocky \u2014 on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, which could lead to many years in prison \u2014 could have on Rihanna.",
      "\u201cYou put it in my head, and now I'm like, \u2018Oh, it would affect her,\u2019\u201d one woman in the jury box responded.",
      "Rocky, who is free on bail and has pleaded not guilty, sat at the defense table, watching the questioning.",

      "But his life could be upended if he's convicted of firing a gun at Terell Ephron, a childhood friend who testified that their relationship had soured and a feud came to a head on the night of Nov. 6, 2021. Ephron testified that bullets grazed his knuckles."

      "Meagan Good is basking in her season of harvest, reaping rewards from the hard work she\u2019s sowed throughout her three-decade career",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Meagan Good is in a season of harvest, reaping rewards from the hard work she\u2019s sowed throughout her three-decade career. For the \u201cHarlem\u201d star, gratitude is her mantra.",
      "\u201cAs crazy as, not even just this last year, the last few years have been for me, this is the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time. And it\u2019s pretty wonderful,\u201d said Good last week with tears welling in her eyes, emotions heightened as she thought of her relationship with Jonathan Majors, her time on \u201cHarlem\u201d and the Los Angeles wildfires.\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for the journey and I\u2019m thankful to be loved.\u201d",
      "Much of that love has been provided by embattled actor Jonathan Majors, and the fluctuating journey includes their scrutinized relationship, leading Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDivorce in the Black\u201d film and starring in the third and final season of \u201cHarlem,\u201d premiering Thursday on Prime Video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that the people who have supported us and have watched the show have waited on us like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d said Good, who plays Camille, a Columbia University professor of sex and love. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to be a part of something so amazing that people love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHarlem\u201d has been a survivor, emerging from the coronavirus pandemic and the Hollywood actors and writers strikes. The Tracy Oliver dramedy follows four women in their 30s (Good, Grace Byers, Jerrie Johnson and Shoniqua Shandai) living in Manhattan\u2019s historic Black neighborhood as they navigate love, friendships and careers. While the series didn\u2019t reach the acclaim of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d it earned a staunch fan base.",
      "\u201cIf you really think about shows about New York, it\u2019s almost like purposefully excluding Black people ... so when we reflect on shows like \u2018Friends\u2019 or even \u2018Sex and The City,\u2019 I probably can count on one hand how many Black people I\u2019ve seen in those shows. But in New York, it\u2019s unavoidable because Black people have created the culture here, specifically in Harlem,\u201d said Johnson, who plays Tye, a queer dating app designer for LBGTQ+ people of color.",
      "\u201cWe loved our \u2018Living Single,\u2019 and that\u2019s why we loved it because we love seeing these women meeting in this small little apartment to commune with each other ... that\u2019s why we have such a cult following because there was a hole in the market that Tracy brilliantly filled.\u201d",
      "Good, 43, said the relationship she shares with her cast, crew and streaming platform is one she hadn\u2019t experienced. \u201cThis definitely has been the best professional experience I\u2019ve had in my entire career in terms of emotionally, mentally, professionally, spiritually.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an emphatic declaration by the former child star whose first major film appearance came in Ice Cube\u2019s 1995 classic \u201cFriday,\u201d shined in \u201cEve\u2019s Bayou\u201d and became a household name to kids on Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cCousin Skeeter\u201d series.",
      "Adored for beauty throughout her relatively drama-free career, many fans questioned her relationship with Majors, the rapidly rising star of \u201cCreed III\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d It began toward the end of 2023 following the 35-year-old\u2019s arrest for allegations of escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse toward ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.",
      "But the \u201cThink Like a Man\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d actor said her Christian faith and life lessons prepared her for the backlash.",
      "\u201cI think about being in my 20s and you see the Media Take Outs and it\u2019s a hundred nice things and there\u2019s like one or two bad things. And I would just internalize it and I would cry and it would hurt my feelings so much,\u201d said Good, who also cited criticism from fellow Christians about her attire and film choices, false skin-bleaching allegations, and the end of her near decade-long marriage with pastor and Hollywood executive DeVon Franklin as perseverance-builders. \u201cI had been praying for maybe like five or six years, \u2019Lord, please deliver me from what people think about me. \u2026 But I will say the part of it that is still hard for me is to see them drag people I love.\u201d",
      "Majors was convicted of one misdemeanor assault charge and a harassment violation. He avoided jail time but was ordered to complete a yearlong counseling program. He also settled a civil suit with Jabbari, but the ordeal nearly extinguished his career.",
      "Good, who was by Majors\u2019 side at court dates and became in engaged to him in November, is optimistic his career will regenerate. (Ironically, Good starred in 50 Cent\u2019s \u201c21 Questions\u201d hit music video in which he proposes scenarios to a potential girlfriend to see if she\u2019d stand by him, including incarceration.)",
      "\u201cThe idea that people are like, \u2019Well, she got paid,\u201d said Good, rolling her eyes at suggestions it\u2019s a publicity stunt \u2014 \u201cit could be hurtful, but I just don\u2019t care anymore. And that\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d",
      "Good, who aspires to star in an action film, has been open about her desire to have children and is focusing on her future with Majors, including launching a health and wellness brand together.",
      "Admirers and industry colleagues believe Good deserves much more recognition.",
      "\u201cPeople have tried to pigeonhole her in a certain area that now she\u2019s breaking free. I always tell her that this is her phoenix moment ... the ashes actually being a metaphor for people\u2019s expectations of her,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cAbout 75% of my favorite movies that shaped my upbringing have Meagan Good in them ... I\u2019ve learned so much about transitioning into womanhood and adulthood through the characters that she\u2019s played.\u201d",
      "Good, however, stresses her focus is not on recognition or major awards, but reaching the hearts of people. She circles back to gratitude for a career that has defied Hollywood odds.",
      "\u201cTo have any appreciation is a gift,\u201d said Good. \u201cI feel like my best is yet to come. And I feel like even now, I\u2019m kind of just getting started.\u201d",

      "The camera is the ghost in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s chillingly effective, experiential haunted house drama \u201cPresence.\u201d",
      "The camera is the ghost in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s chillingly effective, experiential haunted house drama \u201cPresence.\u201d The filmmaker traps the audience in a beautiful suburban home, letting us drift through rooms with this curious being, in and out of delicate conversations as we (and the ghost) try to piece together a puzzle blindly.",
      "Often in haunted house movies where a new family moves in and starts sensing strange things, the ghost knows exactly what they want \u2014 usually their house back. In this one, the presence doesn\u2019t have such a clear objective. It\u2019s more confused, wandering around and investigating the surroundings, like a benevolent amnesiac. Occasionally, though, big emotions erupt, and things shake violently.",
      "Mostly, they go unnoticed. They observe the chipper real estate agent (Julia Fox) preparing for a showing, the painting crew, one of whom believes there\u2019s something around, and finally the family and all the complexities of its dynamics. Lucy Liu (a delightful, wickedly funny scene-stealer) is the mom, Rebecca, a wealthy, successful, type-A woman hyper focused on the success of her eldest, a teenage boy named Tyler (Eddy Maday). The father, Chris (Chris Sullivan), is more of the nurturer, concerned about their teen daughter Chloe (Callina Liang) in the aftermath of her friend\u2019s unexpected death.",
      "There is a family drama transpiring inside the house, only some of which will make sense in the end. We overhear Rebecca drunkenly telling Tyler that everything she does is for him. We listen in as Chris confides to someone on the phone about a hypothetical partner being involved in something illegal and whether they still would be if legally separated. We see Tyler often with his head buried in his phone. And then there's Chloe: Sad, rebellious Chloe, who is the only one to notice that they\u2019re not alone. She\u2019s had the recent trauma, after all, and soon she\u2019s starting a thing with Tyler\u2019s floppy haired, cool guy friend Ryan (West Mulholland). They hook up, they drink, they do drugs, and Chloe gets to escape from her own thoughts \u2014 at least for a little while. Ryan looks straight out of a mid-90s movie, he's an angry, aggrieved kid who assures Chloe that she has the power to decide how this all goes.",
      "\u201cPresence\u201d was written by David Koepp (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d) off of a few pages Soderbergh put together, imagining what it would be like to be the ghost. He is that too, technically, as both director and cinematographer on the project. It\u2019s a slow-burn experience that sneaks up on you, especially once you\u2019ve seen how it plays out. Personally, I didn\u2019t see any of it coming and couldn\u2019t have anticipated the emotional wallop it would pack in the end. It\u2019s a heady experiment that transcends the somewhat gimmicky-on-paper premise \u2014 something Soderbergh manages to do alarmingly well and regularly.",
      "January releases aren\u2019t often the most compelling. Aside from the annual rollout of awards contenders, it\u2019s more often than not a dumping ground. \u201cPresence\u201d is a movie that I first saw last January at the Sundance Film Festival, and yet, even after a year, the chill and the admiration has stubbornly lingered in my mind, like a ghost that just won\u2019t go away, while so many other films have simply faded from memory. It is a rare gem in the January mix.",
      "\u201cPresence,\u201d a Neon release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cteen drinking, drug material, sexuality, language, violence.\u201d Running time: 85 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "NEW YORK -- V, the playwright formerly Eve Ensler, is hoping her new piece of theater can do for climate change what her \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d did for women's rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in a period where we\u2019re so disconnected,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we all have to do is connect \u2014 connect to the Earth and connect to each other.\u201d",
      "She hopes to give audiences a road map at the one-night-only staging of \u201cDear Everything,\u201d with actors and activists Jane Fonda and Rosario Dawson speaking to the crowd. It will play Manhattan's Terminal 5 on Jan. 30.",
      "\u201cAt a time when our planet is burning from the impact of global warming and human-made climate catastrophe, \u2018Dear Everything\u2019 is a powerful musical uprising,\" Fonda said in an email.",
      "The concert-musical hybrid has songs by Justin Tranter, Caroline Pennell and Eren Cannata, choreography by Christiana Hunte and direction by Tony Award-winner Diane Paulus.",
      "V will play the narrator for the story she wrote with 10 singers as well as a youth choir. The show doesn't spell out a single prescription for climate change but hopes to inspire collective action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about the politics of solution. It\u2019s about the politics of connection,\u201d says V. \u201cI think it\u2019s imaginative. I think it\u2019s really calling on all of us to use our imaginations because that's the greatest thing we have to really see a way out of where we are.\u201d",
      "\u201cDear Everything\u201d had an earlier run at Harvard University's American Repertory Theater. Back then, it was called \u201cWILD,\u201d and its run was cut short by the pandemic.",
      "\u201cI was trying to find a way to create a story, to create pop music, that could really generate an awakening in people. Not by pounding them over the head, but by saying, \u2018Listen to the kids. Listen to young people. They really have a vision of what\u2019s coming because they can feel it in their bodies and they want a life.\u2019\u201d",
      "V hopes \u201cDear Everything\u201d can be produced elsewhere. It's not expensive and doesn't need fancy sets or lighting, a bit like her \u201cThe Vagina Monologues,\u201d a series of sly, lyrical, incisive first-person vignettes based on her interviews with hundreds of women.",
      "V describes the Earth as a woman and sees her activism against climate change as part of her overall fight to protect and honor women.",
      "\u201cWe made the mission to end violence against women, girls and trans and non-binary people and the Earth because it was all part of the same story,\u201d she says. \u201cWe're still going.\u201d"

      "PARIS -- Walter Van Beirendonck, one of the last standing designers of the legendary Antwerp Six, delivered a menswear show Wednesday that blended surreal whimsy with biting social commentary at Paris Fashion Week.",
      "As models paraded in oversized beige bowler hats and loose \u201970s check suits with retro boho collars, the collection danced between nostalgia and avant-garde theatrics.",
      "In true Van Beirendonck style, fun collided with the macabre. Edward Scissorhands seemed to haunt the atelier, inspiring sharp-cut deconstructed suits with elongated fake fingers. Skull-and-bone motifs were playful winks on caps, while angular caterpillar shapes crept under sneaker-boots.",
      "Headscarves borrowed from '50s femininity were reimagined into sculptural 3D objects, their abstract forms adding a tactile depth.",
      "Alien energy infused the collection, notably in a spidery face mask paired with those rounded, otherworldly fingers. The eerie yet playful theme persisted, complemented by a mourning black veil resembling a beekeeper\u2019s hat \u2014 a nod to fragility amid the absurd.",
      "The collection was as much about pushing boundaries as it was about sartorial musings.",
      "While Van Beirendonck\u2019s spectacles won\u2019t appeal to traditional tastes, his ability to channel personal and societal tensions into bold, wearable art remains unparalleled. Through his alien alphabets, absurdist headpieces and theatrical proportions, he continues to prove that fashion, at its most compelling, is about daring to question."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:12:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Steven Soderbergh isn&rsquo;t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film",
    "story": [
      "Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film. He\u2019s also, in a way, its central character.",
      "\u201cPresence\u201d is filmed entirely from the POV of a ghost inside a home a family has just moved into. Soderbergh, who serves as his own cinematographer under the pseudonym Peter Andrews (his father's name), essentially performs as the presence, a floating point-of-view that watches as the violence that killed the mysterious ghost threatens to be repeated.",
      "For even the prolific Soderbergh, the film, which opens Friday in theaters, was a unique challenge. He shot \u201cPresence\u201d with a small digital camera while wearing slippers to soften his steps.",
      "The 62-year-old filmmaker recently met a reporter in a midtown Manhattan hotel in between finishing post-production on his other upcoming movie (\"Black Bag,\" a thriller Focus Features will release March 14) and beginning production in a few weeks on his next project, a romantic comedy that he says \u201cfeels like a George Cukor movie.\u201d",
      "Soderbergh, whose films include \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d the \u201cOcean's 11\u201d movies, \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d tends to do a lot in small windows of time. \u201cPresence\u201d took 11 days to film.",
      "That dexterous proficiency has made the ever-experimenting Soderbergh one of Hollywood's most widely respected evaluators of the movie business. In a wide-ranging conversation, he discussed why he thinks streaming is the most destructive force the movies have ever faced and why he's \u201cthe cockroach of this industry.\"",
      "SODERBERGH: No, but what I did is subtle. For the first and only time Peter Andrews has a camera operator credit. That\u2019s not a credit that I typically take because I don\u2019t need it and I typically have another operator working with me. But I felt like this was a workout. It was tricky, but really fun. It was another level of performance anxiety because I ruined more takes than anyone else in the film by a larger factor. I was the one going: \u201cCut. I f\u2014ed that up. We got to go again.\u201d",
      "SODERBERGH: The beauty of projects at this scale is I can just do them without having to talk to anybody. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want notes. It\u2019s because it\u2019s just the brain trust and none of the psychic real estate is taken up by things that have nothing to do with what you\u2019re going to shoot. I went from that into a more traditional project in which a lot of psychic real estate gets taken up by the process of having a studio finance your movie. I like these people, it\u2019s just a lot of lawyers. Like, a lot of lawyers.",
      "SODERBERGH: It removes a key reference point for an artist. It\u2019s helpful to know how something is doing, or how it did. You need to know that to calibrate whether you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish, whether you can work at a certain level. That\u2019s one of the most confusing things about it, the black box of it. Apart from the economic invisibility of what\u2019s going on there \u2014 the fact that we can\u2019t really look under the hood of how these streaming companies work economically \u2014 there\u2019s another kind of handrail that\u2019s missing that I find really helpful. At the end of the day, I, at least, want to know. The market will tell you how you\u2019re doing. I want to know that so I can adjust or go in another direction. Being irrelevant isn\u2019t very appealing. What is the overlap between what people seem to be responding to and what I like? Because I don\u2019t want to make these things and have nobody see them. I\u2019ve had enough people say, \u201cOh, did that come out?\u201d It\u2019s a public art form.",
      "SODERBERGH: The good news is, if you talk to Focus Features and Neon and A24, young people are going to the movies. This is the Letterboxd generation. That\u2019s fantastic. I hope that ripples outside the U.S. They are cine-literate and they expect something singular. They want the signature, they want the stamp of a filmmaker. And that\u2019s turning into a real business. One of the things, I think, we all need to do, but especially the people who cover the industry, is to stop using the studio metric for what a success is. That\u2019s not a template you should be applying to everything.",
      "SODERBERGH: There was a period of about 10 to 14 year where the best movies of the year were also the most popular movies of the year. That\u2019s not necessarily true anymore. You can pick one of the movies that\u2019s in the hunt this year and go: That\u2019s a \u201970s movie. That\u2019s as good and interesting as one of those. But it\u2019s not going to do the business that one of those would have done. It\u2019s the artist\u2019s job to adapt. When it comes to trying to control what people want to go see, you\u2019re now in a place like: \u201cIf I really wish hard, it won\u2019t rain.\u201d The weather is the weather. To a certain degree, the audience is a weather system. Luckily because of the way I began, I\u2019m the cockroach of this industry. I can survive any version of it.",
      "SODERBERGH: Yeah, when you see \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s different.\u201d There are more shots in the first four minutes of \u201cBlack Bag\u201d than the entirety of \u201cPresence.\u201d It\u2019s a different thing and it has different demands.",
      "SODERBERGH: No, it feels more like a natural evolution and a natural response in the sense of: I want to be a different filmmaker for this. I don\u2019t want to know the outcome. If you have a conversation with a filmmaker who says they have \u201cfigured things out,\u201d you should run in the other direction. It's like: You\u2019re deluded and you have a very superficial understanding of what this art form demands if you\u2019re not humbled by what it asks of you to be distinctive.",
      "SODERBERGH: No, I still feel like I\u2019m reaching for something I quite possibly won\u2019t ever grasp and maybe shouldn\u2019t. As frustrating as it may be to feel like I've never made a thing that is at the level of one of my heroes made, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I did feel that. Do you stop, then? The movie \u201cCome and See,\u201d that guy got to basically go: \u201cThat\u2019s my mic drop.\u201d I\u2019ve never made anything approaching that.",
      "SODERBERGH: Oh, I\u2019m very happy with that film. I\u2019m very proud of that film. I can\u2019t say there\u2019s much in it that I\u2019d go back and change. That said, it\u2019s not \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d Or \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d By my standards, I don\u2019t look at it and go, \u201cThat\u2019s as good as \u2018The Third Man.\u2019\u201d I\u2019m good at pushing myself into areas that are slightly beyond my comfort zone, but I also understand what my limitations are. I\u2019m inherently not a grandiose thinker about myself or my work. That\u2019s a critical component to some of the films I\u2019m talking about that I think are amazing. I could never make \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d I don\u2019t think of myself as a filmmaker the way Francis (Ford Coppola) thinks of himself. That\u2019s not: He should be like me or I should be like him. It\u2019s just how we\u2019re built. I\u2019m more earthbound, I guess is the word. And that\u2019s what I like and what I\u2019m good at.",
      "SODERBERGH: I think it\u2019s the way I was born and the way I was raised. And the people who were around me when I was younger who mentored me. I just don\u2019t think I was born with the grandiosity gene and there was nobody around me who would have cultivated that even if I had shown signs. Going to Sundance last year with \u201cPresence\u201d was really gratifying. If you\u2019d told me 35 years later you\u2019re going to come back here (where \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d premiered in 1989) with a movie that people are interested in seeing, I would have wept."

      "Conductor Rapha\u00ebl Pichon makes his New York debut at age 40 on Thursday night, leading the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s at Carnegie Hall",
      "NEW YORK -- Rapha\u00ebl Pichon was at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport with his Ensemble Pygmalion orchestra and chorus on March 12, 2020, catching a plane to New York for his U.S. debut nine days later at the Park Avenue Armory in Monteverdi\u2019s \u201cMarian Vespers.\u201d",
      "First the flight was delayed. Then it was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cIn the middle of the night they closed the skies,\u201d the conductor said.",
      "His American debut was delayed until December 2021 with Boston\u2019s Handel and Haydn Society. He makes first New York appearance at age 40 on Thursday night, leading the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s in a program with baritone Christian Gerhaher and soprano Ying Fang titled \u201cMein Traum (My Dream)\u201d featuring works by Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann and Carl Maria von Weber.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s really the future of classical music,\u201d said James Roe, the St. Luke\u2019s orchestra president. \u201cHe sees the potential of the concert experience in a way that\u2019s both expansive and welcoming and of the next generation. And he wants the concerts to propose a story, a narrative, an odyssey, a way of moving an audience member from their everyday life to something extraordinarily pleasurable.\u201d",
      "Rowe first met Pichon at the 2023 Salzburg Festival in Austria, where Pichon led a new production of Mozart\u2019s \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro \u201d by director Martin Ku\u0161ej that included cocaine-fueled fights and a predator priest. Pichon\u2019s wife, soprano Sabine Devieilhe, sang Susanna.",
      "\u201cI think, sadly, the stage director was in a very, very bad mood and a very difficult moment of his life, and, sadly, the consequences were big,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "The Vienna Philharmonic in the pit produced a different sound than the leaner approach Pichon is used to from Pygmalion\u2019s period instruments. As the Salzburg Festival\u2019s resident orchestra since 1922, the Vienna Philharmonic performs in numerous operas and concerts.",
      "\u201cSometimes 100% of the orchestra is changing from one night to the next night, so it could create some fantastic nights and some really banal moments, so it\u2019s really strange,\u201d Pichon said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really music, but an amazing experience. Learned a lot. Never again. You understand many things about Salzburg, about Austrian culture, about Viennese culture, their role in this classical music world. It\u2019s really something, but it\u2019s a really strange philosophy. Vienna Philharmoniker \u2014 it\u2019s a society inside a society. It\u2019s a really strange world.\u201d",
      "Alex Fortes, a St. Luke\u2019s violin player, said Pichon made an immediate positive impression this week.",
      "\u201cHe has both an incredible clarity and a physical movement in terms of communicating what he wants,\u201d Fortes said, \u201cas well as incredibly eloquent and precise language to describe those things quite figuratively and beautifully that inspire the orchestra.\u201d",
      "Born in Brittany, Pichon played violin when he was young, started singing in a choir when he was 10 and gave that up for piano and harpsichord. He met Devieilhe while singing in a youth choir. They live together with their two young children in Paris\u2019 13th arrondissement, a unit combined from several apartments that is soundproofed, allowing each a piano to practice with.",
      "Gerhaher first encountered Devieilhe when they sang together at Munich\u2019s Bavarian State Opera last summer.",
      "\u201cShe was just absolutely outstanding and amazing and I thought, well, her husband must be equally brilliant. Otherwise they can\u2019t stay together,\u201d Gerhaher said with a laugh.",
      "Pichon founded Pygmalion in 2006. It performs 60-70 concerts per year, including at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, the Dutch National Opera and Paris\u2019 Op\u00e9ra-Comique, where Pichon conducted an opera with his wife for the first time, L\u00e9o Delibes\u2019 \u201cLakm\u00e9,\u201d in 2022. Pichon has commissioned a comic opera from French-Argentine composer Oscar Strasnoy to premiere there in 2027.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a bit tired with all these operas telling us (about) the end of the world and I wanted something really different and more corrosive and more comic and more sarcastic,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "While he is a Baroque specialist, he has listened to the British rock band Radiohead for two decades.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of parallels with classical music, because I\u2019m really so amazed by their ability to erase what they\u2019ve just done and try to explore each time a new world,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "He led the St. Luke\u2019s orchestra on Monday for a rehearsal at The DiMenna Center for Classical Music, in a windswept area of Manhattan near the Hudson River. The harshest cold snap of the winter had set in.",
      "\u201cThe music we are making is the biggest contrast from the weather we experienced outside,\u201d Fortes recalled Pichon saying. \u201cIt\u2019s full of warmth and fire and beauty.\u201d"

      "As many in the entertainment industry navigate the devastating effects of the California wildfires, some will soon be decamping to cleaner air in the mountains. The annual Sundance Film Festival begins Thursday in Park City, Utah.",
      "The 41st edition of Robert Redford\u2019s brainchild will, as always, be a year of discovery and discussion. There are timely films:",
      "\u2014 \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d which will premiere just days after former President Joe Biden commuted the sentence of the Indigenous activist nearly half a century after he was imprisoned for the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "\u2014 Oscar-winner Mstyslav Chernov\u2019s\u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and Frontline about an attempt to liberate an occupied territory in Ukraine",
      "\u2014 Several films about trans rights including \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about civil rights lawyer Chase Strangio. It's a topic even more pressing after President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday rolling back protections for transgender people.",
      "There are even some controversies brewing: \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d from documentary filmmaker Bao Nguyen, calls into question who took the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cNapalm Girl\u201d photograph. Retired AP photographer Nick Ut and the AP, which conducted a six-month investigation into the allegation, are contesting it vigorously and lawyers have asked for it to be pulled from the program.",
      "\u201cThe film is an investigation,\u201d said Eugene Hernandez, the director of the festival, who is moving forward with plans to screen it. \u201cI think it will be a really important conversation that will come out over the next few days after the film is seen by more people.\u201d",
      "Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not all heavy. There\u2019s drama of course, even a film about starting over after a fire (\u201cRebuilding,\u201d with Josh O\u2019Connor), horror, satire, literary adaptations, comedy, documentaries about famous faces, and some that simply defy categorization.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some really funny stuff in the program,\u201d Hernandez said. One of those Hernandez cited is \u201cBubble & Squeak,\u201d about a married couple accused of smuggling cabbages into a nation where they\u2019re banned.",
      "For first time filmmakers, Sundance can be their chance to break through in a big way. That happened last year for \u201cD\u00ecdi\u201d filmmaker Sean Wang. Some films that debuted last January are still in the awards conversation, like \u201cA Real Pain\u201d and \u201cA Different Man.\u201d For actors, the festival is both a casual respite to awards season glitz (snow boots are more likely on red carpets than high heels) and can be a chance to show audiences a new dimension of their talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a strong year of renewal for our artist community,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of really great voices and stories that we get to unveil in the coming days.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s everything you need to know:",
      "Sundance runs from Jan. 23 through Feb. 2. There are about 90 features premiering across the 11 days, with screenings starting early in the morning through midnight. Award-winners will be announced on Jan. 31.",
      "Stars with films premiering include Jennifer Lopez, Benedict Cumberbatch, Diego Luna, Conan O\u2019Brien, Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Ayo Edebiri, Olivia Colman, Andr\u00e9 Holland, Steven Yeun, Mark Ruffalo, Bowen Yang, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Lily Gladstone, Dev Patel, Emily Watson, John Lithgow, Marlee Matlin, John Malkovich, Rose Byrne, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Josh O\u2019Connor, Ben Whishaw, Dylan O\u2019Brien, Lili Reinhart and Willem Dafoe.",
      "One of the greatest things about Sundance is that it\u2019s often the under-the-radar movies that become the breakouts.",
      "But some of the higher-profile premieres going into the festival include: Bill Condon\u2019s \u201cKiss of the Spider-Woman,\u201d starring Lopez; Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson\u2019s documentary \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genius)\u201d; \u201cOpus,\u201d a horror about the cult of celebrity with Edebiri and John Malkovich; Andrew Ahn\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d with Bowen Yang and Kelly Marie Tran; the war satire \u201cAtropia,\u201d with Alia Shawkat; \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d about the late Paul Reubens; \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d; and Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman\u2019s doc \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about a cover-up in one of America\u2019s most notorious prison systems.",
      "Festival organizers have been in dialogue with filmmakers, staff, audiences and donors about the effects of the fires, supporting and accommodating where possible including pushing back deadlines to allow filmmakers more time to finish. The festival will also have a QR code displayed before screenings for information on sharing resources or contributing to relief efforts.",
      "\u201cAs hard as the last week has been, this will be a moment to come together,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe community\u2019s really responding to support those who need it most right now. I think that\u2019s going to be a profound aspect of this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "For the most part, yes. Starting in 2027 the festival will no longer be primarily based in Park City. It may stay in Utah but would operate mainly out of Salt Lake City. Other finalists are Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The Sundance Institute is expected to announce its final decision in the first quarter of 2025.",
      "\u201cPark City as the home of Sundance is such a special place,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI look at it optimistically because we have two more exciting years in this current configuration. I think we\u2019re going to make the most of those two years and make them as memorable and meaningful as we can.\u201d",
      "Access to the movies premiering at Sundance doesn\u2019t necessary require an expensive trip to Park City anymore. The festival has fully embraced an online component for many of their films.",
      "What started as a necessary COVID-19 adjustment has become a vital part of the program. From Jan. 30 through Feb. 2, audiences can stream much of the program online. Prices start at $35 for a single film ticket and go up to $800 for unlimited access.",
      "Otherwise, films that secure distribution can take anywhere from a few weeks to over a year to hit theaters or streaming services. Steven Soderbergh's \u201cPresence,\u201d which premiered last January, is just hitting theaters this week.",

      "NEW YORK -- An estimated 24.6 million television viewers watched President Donald Trump's second inauguration, the smallest audience for the quadrennial ceremony since Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013.",
      "The Nielsen Company said Tuesday that viewership was down from Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration, which reached 33.8 million, and Trump's first move into the White House, seen by 30.6 million in 2017.",
      "Inauguration viewership has varied widely over the past half-century, from a high of 41.8 million when Ronald Reagan came into office in 1981 to a low of 15.5 million for the start of George W. Bush's second term in 2004.",
      "The length of Trump's inauguration coverage may have hurt him in bragging rights. The 24.6 million figure represents the average number of people tuning in to coverage on one of 15 networks between 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Eastern. In past years, the coverage didn't go on for so long, which meant the averages were likely higher because people tune away as the day goes on.",
      "Nielsen had no immediate estimate, for example, of how many people watched Trump up until 4 p.m. Eastern, the cutoff point for most inauguration coverage in the past.",
      "There's no doubt where most viewers gravitated on Monday: Fox News Channel had 10.3 million viewers between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m., when Trump was sworn in and gave his inaugural speech. In that same period, ABC had 4.7 million viewers, NBC had 4.4 million, CBS had 4.1 million, CNN had 1.7 million and MSNBC had 848,000, Nielsen said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two years after her shocking decision to resign as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern is set to publish a memoir.",
      "Crown, a division of Penguin Random House, announced Tuesday that Ardern's \u201cA Different Kind of Power\" is scheduled for June 3. Only 37 when elected in 2017, Ardern will reflect on some of the decisions and events that made her known worldwide. She was widely praised for her compassionate response to the 2019 terrorist attacks against two mosques in Christchurch and for her initial handing of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cSome people thought kindness was sentimental, soft. A bit naive, even. I knew this. But I also knew they were wrong,\" Ardern said in a statement. \"Kindness has a power and strength that almost nothing else on this planet has. I\u2019d seen kindness do extraordinary things \u2014 I\u2019d seen it give people hope, I\u2019d seen it change minds, and transform live. Kindness. This was my guiding principle, and it would be the trait with which I would try to lead, no matter what lay ahead.\u201d",
      "By early 2023, the coronavirus was spreading, and resistance was growing to her zero-tolerance policy of mandates and other restrictions which had helped keep the pandemic out of New Zealand. With her popularity fading, Ardern stunned many supporters by deciding to leave, saying she no longer had \u201cenough in the tank.\u201d In June 2023, she was made a Dame Grand Companion, the second-highest honor in New Zealand, as part of King Charles III\u2019s Birthday Honors. Around the same time, Ardern posted on Instagram that she was working on a book, one more focused on leadership than on \u201cinternal politics.\u201d",
      "Crown is calling her book a \u201cdeeply personal and inspiring memoir\u201d that offers \u201cArdern\u2019s unfiltered journey, from tenacious girl in small-town New Zealand to a trailblazing world leader who became the world\u2019s youngest female head of government, and only the second in history to give birth while in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cArdern changed the world\u2019s expectations of what a global leader can be. With remarkable candor, she shares the pivotal moments that defined her leadership and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 the details behind her decision to step down during her sixth year as Prime Minister,\" Crown announced."

      "A new study suggests that a pill used for emergency contraception could be repurposed at a higher dose as an abortion drug, providing a possible alternative to mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in the most common type of abortion in the United States.",
      "Mifepristone has been under attack by abortion opponents, with several states seeking in federal court to restrict its use.",
      "Now used in two-thirds of U.S. abortions, mifepristone blocks a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy. It's typically used with misoprostol, which causes contractions and bleeding.",
      "In the study, 133 women who were up to nine weeks' pregnant took a 60 milligram dose of ulipristal acetate, the active ingredient in the prescription contraceptive Ella, followed by misoprostol 24 hours later.",
      "For 97% of them, that drug combo was effective at inducing an abortion, an effectiveness equal to the mifepristone-misoprostol combination. Four women needed a procedure or an additional medication to complete the abortion.",
      "The 60 milligram dose of ulipristal used in the study is twice the dose of Ella, a prescription drug used for emergency contraception.",
      "The company that makes Ella says on its website that it won't end an existing pregnancy. It can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.",
      "The findings, published Thursday in the journal NEJM Evidence, may make emergency contraception a target of abortion opponents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried that these results could be misapplied by anti-abortion activists to try to further their assault on contraception,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. Grossman praised the study but said more research is needed on ulipristal as an abortion drug before doctors would prescribe it routinely for that use.",
      "Lead author Dr. Beverly Winikoff, president of Gynuity Health Projects, a not-for-profit research group, said women need information about ulipristal, especially with mifepristone challenged in court.",
      "\u201cAt least now we would have an alternative,\u201d Winikoff said. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to have more things that you could use.\u201d",

    "summary": "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
    "story": [
      "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
      "NEW YORK -- The trouble started every day at around 3 p.m., after Cathy Higgins had spent five or six hours staring at an array of computer screens at her desk. Her university job overseeing research projects involved peering closely at numbers and details on contracts, applications and budgets.",
      "\u201cMy vision was so blurry, I couldn\u2019t even see what was on the screen, and I was squinting so much that I could not function,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "When her eyesight got bad, Higgins walked around and spoke with members of her staff. She began planning in-person meetings for afternoons. But she would resume the computer work late at night after her children went to bed.",
      "\u201cIf I had to continue working through the blurry vision, that\u2019s when the migraines would happen,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "Digital screens are pervasive, not only at work but in our homes, schools and shops. An estimated 104 million Americans of working age spend more than seven hours a day in front of screens, according to the American Optometric Association. All that screen time can take a toll.",
      "Too much exposure to screens can lead to dry or watery eyes, fuzzy vision and headaches. It can also lead to myopia, or nearsightedness, in some people, especially children. Some technology workers even describe short bouts of vertigo when they look at screens for too long.",
      "One reason for the discomfort is that staring closely at screens for prolonged periods causes the muscle that helps eye focus to tighten up.",
      "\u201cThat muscle's not supposed to stay tight all day long. And if it does, it's like picking up a light weight and trying to hold it over your head for hours,\u201d American Optometric Association President Steven Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to pick it up. But after a while, even though it\u2019s not a heavy lift, your body just gets tired.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, exposure to blue light from computer screens and devices has not been shown to cause permanent eye damage, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Nevertheless, symptoms can disrupt work, family time and rest. As an optometrist in Mississippi, Reed sees patients who complain of frequent eye pain, headaches and blurry vision associated with computer use. He advises getting an eye exam and taking frequent breaks.",
      "For Higgins, trying to catch up on the work she couldn't do when her eyes were too fatigued on weekdays cut into time she spent with her daughters on weekends. \u201cThey\u2019d be playing together, and I couldn\u2019t be as engaged as I would have liked to have been in what they were doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Here are some tips from eye health professionals to reduce eye strain caused by devices.",
      "Take a break every 20 minutes from sitting at a computer. During the break, focus your eyes on something that's about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Pausing close-up work and looking at something in the distance gives tired, tight muscles time to relax.",
      "\u201cLuckily, eye strain is temporary,\u201d said Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist at Midwest Eye Institute in Indianapolis who serves as spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. \u201cThe best way to avoid these symptoms is by taking breaks from our screens or near work activities and using lubricating eye drops, if needed.\u201d",
      "People usually blink about 18 to 22 times per minute. But when looking at a screen, the rate drops to three to seven times per minute, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's where eye drops come in.",
      "It's good to move around and go outside, but when you don't have time for an outdoor walk, frequent 20-second breaks can help.",
      "Some people find that using a larger computer monitor helps reduce eye fatigue. You can also increase the font size on your laptop, monitor or smartphone screen.",
      "Higgins did all of the above after she started a new job as senior vice president at Stand Up to Cancer. Since she works remotely from home in Midlothian, Virginia, she got a 29-inch monitor and sits about three feet away from it, about a foot farther than in most office setups.",
      "The changes helped. She still has occasional issues with blurriness, but not as frequently. \u201cWhen I have an extended day, like a 12-hour day, that\u2019s when I start to have vision issues again,\u201d she said.",
      "Sitting an arm\u2019s length away from your screen and adjusting it so you\u2019re looking slightly downward also can help reduce eye strain, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Some products, such as blue light glasses, are marketed with claims that they will reduce digital eye strain, improve sleep and prevent eye disease. But several studies have found the glasses are not very effective, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology. It's really our behavior with digital devices that causes symptoms, not the small amount of blue light coming from screens, the group said.",
      "After stepping away from computers at work, many people find themselves reading or scrolling on smartphone screens. It's not just workers: children are using laptops, tablets and smart screens in school settings throughout the day.",
      "Too much screen time or focusing on nearby objects can accelerate the onset and progression of nearsightedness, especially in children, said Ayesha Malik, pediatric optometrist in the division of ophthalmology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Anyone streaming shows should do so on a television, instead of a tablet, to help relieve eye strain, she said.",
      "Children should follow the 20-20-20-2 rule, which includes an extra \u201c2\u201d at the end to encourage playing outdoors for 2 hours a day, which helps with eye development, she said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that most children are engaging with screens throughout the day at school and home. It becomes difficult to track the total number of hours,\u201d Malik said. \u201cAim for not more than 20 minutes during any one session.\u201d",
      "The blue light that digital screens emit can increase alertness, so watching Netflix on an iPad or scrolling through social media feeds in bed may make it hard to get restful sleep.",
      "To give your eyes and brain the rest they need, doctors recommend turning off screens one to two hours before going to sleep. You can also set devices to \u201cdark mode\u201d in the evening to reduce the impact of bright light. If you\u2019re used to streaming videos at night, try listening to an audiobook or podcast instead.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be flying high",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be flying high.",
      "Israel\u2019s enemies across the region have been badly weakened during 15 months of war. Israeli hostages have begun to come home from captivity in Gaza, and Netanyahu\u2019s good friend, Donald Trump, is back in the White House.",
      "But Netanyahu may have little time to enjoy his improving fortunes.",
      "His hard-line coalition partners have threatened to topple the government if he does not resume Israel\u2019s war in Gaza when a six-week ceasefire with Hamas expires. That could leave Netanyahu torn between his erstwhile allies at home and a U.S. president who says he wants to end the region\u2019s wars.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at Netanyahu\u2019s conundrum, and how Trump could determine his fate.",
      "After the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war, Netanyahu\u2019s popularity plunged. Israel\u2019s security and intelligence services had failed to prevent the deadliest attack in its 75-year history and the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas was holding scores of hostages in Gaza and the nation was grieving.",
      "But Netanyahu regained his footing and now boasts of military successes across the region.",
      "Israeli forces inflicted heavy losses on Hamas in a 15-month offensive that also has killed tens of thousands of people, including entire families, caused widespread damage and displaced 90% of the population. It will take Gaza years to recover.",
      "At the same time, Israel responded to rocket fire from Hezbollah militants with an air and ground offensive that badly weakened the Lebanese group.",
      "The tough blow to Hezbollah, which included a complex operation to explode pagers and walkie-talkies, appears to have contributed to the downfall of President Bashar Assad in neighboring Syria \u2013 one of Hezbollah\u2019s closest allies and its main conduit for arms. Iran, the main patron of Hezbollah and Assad, has watched its regional sphere of influence weaken, while Israeli airstrikes have reportedly taken out the country\u2019s air defenses and other sensitive targets.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House brings the likelihood of even tougher pressure on Iran, along with renewed efforts to deliver a historic normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia, a rival of Iran and the Arab world\u2019s richest and most powerful country.",
      "As a result, many Israelis, including Netanyahu, consider the country to be in a much stronger strategic position than at the outset of the war, albeit at a heavy price.",
      "\"We have made it clear to our enemies and to the entire world, that when the people of Israel stand together, there is no force that can break us,\u201d Netanyahu said on the eve of the ceasefire this week.",
      "Just as Netanyahu could be benefiting from Israel\u2019s battlefield gains, he finds himself fighting for political survival.",
      "Throughout the war, Netanyahu promised a \u201ctotal victory\u201d against Hamas \u2014 destroying the group\u2019s governing and military capabilities and bringing home all of the hostages remaining in Gaza.",
      "The ceasefire falls short of these goals. Over six weeks, Israel is set to bring home just one-third of the more than 90 remaining hostages. The fate of the others remains unclear.",
      "The first hostage release illustrated how elusive total victory will be. Moments after the ceasefire took effect, armed Hamas men came out of hiding and were back in the streets. Masked militants escorted the Red Cross vehicles carrying three released hostages, and the Hamas-run government says it is protecting the delivery of international humanitarian aid.",
      "Israel also agreed to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including dozens involved in deadly attacks on Israelis, angering Netanyahu's hard-line base.",
      "The terms of the deal led one hard-line politician, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to pull his party out of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, leaving the prime minister with a narrow majority in parliament.",
      "On Monday, a second hard-liner, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, vowed to follow suit if Netanyahu doesn\u2019t resume the war when the 42-day truce expires in early March. Smotrich\u2019s departure from the government would rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority, almost certainly triggering new elections.",
      "\u201cIf, God forbid, the war is not resumed, I will bring the government down,\u201d Smotrich told reporters.",
      "Netanyahu has vowed to renew the war if Hamas doesn\u2019t meet his demands in negotiations over the second phase of the ceasefire, which aims to end the war. Talks are set to begin in less than two weeks.",
      "\u201cIf we need to go back to the fighting, we will do so in new ways and with great force,\u201d Netanyahu said.",
      "But doing so may not be so easy. The emotional scenes of the three young women freed by Hamas reuniting with their families has captured the nation\u2019s attention. Halting this process without the full return of hostages would be difficult in a country where their families have widespread sympathy. The public \u2013 and the army \u2013 are tired after 15 months of fighting and a steady stream of soldiers dying in action.",
      "The battlefield in Gaza also is changing. The first phase of the ceasefire allows Gaza\u2019s nearly 2 million displaced people to leave crowded tent camps and return to what remains of their homes. This will allow Hamas to regroup in the midst of masses of civilians.",
      "Israel, and Netanyahu himself, already are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the world\u2019s top courts over the civilian toll in Gaza, making resuming a military offensive especially challenging.",
      "With the clock ticking on Netanyahu's fate, Trump could be a deciding factor.",
      "Even before taking office, Trump pressed Netanyahu to reach the ceasefire deal, and the involvement of his new Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, appears to have been critical in wrapping up the agreement.",
      "On the first day of Trump's second administration, he gave mixed signals of what may lie ahead.",
      "In his inaugural speech, he described himself as \u201ca peacemaker and a unifier.\u201d But later he said he was not confident the ceasefire will hold.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not our war. It\u2019s their war,\u201d he said.",
      "After angering Trump four years ago by congratulating Joe Biden on his 2020 election victory, Netanyahu is working hard to line up Trump's support.",
      "He was among the first world leaders to congratulate Trump after his swearing-in. In an effusive message, he thanked Trump for his help in freeing hostages and said he looked forward to working together to destroy Hamas.",
      "\u201cI am sure, Mr. President, that under your leadership, the best days of our alliance are yet to come,\u201d he said.",
      "But their visions may not be the same.",
      "Speaking to Fox News this week, Witkoff said that Trump wants the first phase of the ceasefire to succeed for the sides to continue to phase 2 talks. \u201cThat is his directive, and that's what we're going to do,\u201d he said."

      "The Socialist leader wants the European Union, which already leads the world in internet regulation, to put additional checks on Elon Musk\u2019s X, trendsetting video app TikTok, and Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram for having, in his words, put participatory democracy and the mental health of users at risk.",
      "\u201cI believe social media are now a common resource for humanity, like the oceans, and they should be protected and managed accordingly,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "While attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the prime minister on Wednesday laid out his vision for how the EU might \"make social media great again.\u201d Here is what you need to know about his three-point plan:",
      "S\u00e1nchez he would propose legislation aimed at ending anonymity for social media users when the EU's leaders meet in Brussels on March 20-21.",
      "His idea is for each username to be a pseudonym that must be registered under a real identity with European authorities, using a \u201cEuropean digital identity wallet.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis way citizens could use nicknames if they want, but in the case of a crime, public authorities would be able to connect those nicknames to real people and hold them responsible,\u201d he said.",
      "S\u00e1nchez argued that \u201cno one can send packages without showing an I.D. or buy a hunting weapon without giving their name, and yet we are allowing people to roam freely on social networks without linking their profiles to a real identity. This paves the way for misinformation, hate speech and cyber harassment because it is facilitating the use of bots and it is allowing people to act without being held accountable for their actions.\u201d",
      "The proposal, however, clashes with longstanding demands of digital rights groups, which say that protection of online anonymity is important to protect freedom of speech and removing it could have a chilling effect. Such groups say anonymity is a cornerstone of online communications and a critical tool to challenge authority and express controversial opinions.",
      "S\u00e1nchez will urge European officials to apply the 27-nation bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act to \u201cforce open the black box of social media algorithms.\" The EU adopted the law in 2023 with the stated goal of keeping internet users safe online.",

Meanwhile, Missouri's attorney-general unveiled plans for new rules on algorithm transparency, including giving internet users a choice of the algorithms their social media platforms use.",
      "The third plank of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s plan is for the EU to go right up to the top of the social media companies for any social ills produced by their platforms.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said he recommends that \u201csocial media CEOs (be) held personally accountable for non-compliance with laws and norms in their platforms,\u201d describing such accountability as no different than what most business owners have for their products.",
      "Britain has taken a similar step. Under online safety rules, senior managers at tech companies face criminal liability in certain situations, mainly for the relatively minor issue of failing to respond properly to information requests.",
      "Spain has joined governments around the world that are concerned with the impact of social media on children and teenagers. Spain has limited the use of mobile phones in schools, while S\u00e1nchez has decried what he calls an epidemic of online pornography that increasingly is reaching young children.",

      "Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO and the founder of Facebook, also has sought Trump's approval. Meta has rolled back its content moderation, a move that critics say will let misinformation and online abuse spread unchecked.",
      "\u201c(The) owners of the big social media consoles, a small group of techno billionaires ... are no longer satisfied with holding nearly total economic power,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cNow they also want political power in a way that is undermining our democratic institutions.\u201d",

      "A French woman who had stopped having sex with her husband and had been considered at fault in a divorce, has won a case at Europe\u2019s top human rights court",
      "PARIS -- The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) sided Thursday with a French woman who had stopped having sex with her husband, saying she should not have been considered at fault on those grounds in their divorce.",
      "The ruling concerned a fault-based case in which the blame was attributed solely to the applicant. Back in 2019, a French court of appeal ruled that her refusal to have sex was a breach of a marital duty and granted the couple a divorce to her detriment.",
      "But the ECHR ruled that the French court was wrong, condemning France for a violation of the woman\u2019s right to respect for private and family life.",
      "\u201cThe Court considered that the reaffirmation of the principle of marital duties and the fact that the divorce had been granted on the grounds that the applicant had ceased all sexual relations with her husband amounted to interferences with her right to respect for private life, her sexual freedom and her right to bodily autonomy,\u201d the court said in a news release.",
      "The applicant, identified as H.W., is a French national who was born in 1955. She had started divorce proceedings against her husband on the grounds of fault, alleging that he had prioritized his career over family life and that he had been bad-tempered, violent and abusive. They had four children together.",
      "The husband counterattacked, arguing that the divorce should be granted on the grounds of fault of the applicant alone.",
      "He claimed that she had failed to fulfil her marital duties for several years and that she had breached the duty of mutual respect between spouses by making defamatory allegations.",
      "After the Court of Appeal of Versailles granted the divorce and attributed fault solely on her, the plaintiff referred the case to the ECHR in 2021.",
      "\u201cIn the Court\u2019s view, consent to marriage could not imply consent to future sexual relations,\u201d the Strasbourg-based court insisted. \u201cSuch an interpretation would be tantamount to denying that marital rape was reprehensible in nature. On the contrary, consent had to reflect a free willingness to engage in sexual relations at a given moment and in the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "The ruling came a month after 51 men were convicted in France in a drugging-and-rape trial that riveted France and spurred debates on adding the notion of consent to French rape laws."

      "Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi fielded pointed questions from opposition lawmakers during a Senate session two days after Ossama Anjiem, also know as Ossama al-Masri, was flown on a government plane back to Tripoli, where he received a hero's welcome. He had been arrested over the weekend in Turin after attending a soccer match.",
      "Al-Masri was repatriated to Tripoli \u201cfor urgent security reasons, with my expulsion order, in view of the danger posed by the subject,\u2019\u2019 Piantedosi told the Senate. He refused to go into greater detail, citing a scheduled address to lawmakers next week.",
      "Senators expressed dismay that Italy had ignored its obligations to the criminal court in the Netherlands to turn over criminal suspects. They repeated calls that Premier Giorgia Meloni respond to lawmakers\u2019 questions in an open session.",
      "The ICC warrant accused al-Masri of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Mitiga prison in Libya starting in 2015 that are punishable with life in prison.",
      "The ICC said he was accused of murder, torture, rape and sexual violence. It said the warrant was transmitted to member states on Saturday, including Italy, and that the court had also provided real-time information that he had entered Europe. The court said it had reminded Italy at the time to contact it \u201cwithout delay\u201d if it ran into any problems cooperating with the warrant.",
      "But Rome\u2019s court of appeals ordered al-Masri freed Tuesday, and he was sent back to Libya aboard an aircraft of the Italian secret services, because of what the appeals court said was a procedural error in his arrest. The ruling said Justice Minister Carlo Nordio should have been informed ahead of time, since the justice ministry handles all relations with the ICC. Nordio did not respond to lawmakers' questions on Wednesday.",
      "Italy has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, on whom it relies to patrol its coasts and prevent waves of migrants from leaving. Any trial in The Hague of al-Masri could bring unwanted attention to Italy\u2019s migration policies and its support of the Libyan coast guard, which it has financed to prevent migrants from leaving.",
      "Human rights groups have documented gross abuses in the Libyan detention facilities where migrants are kept, and have accused Italy of being complicit in their mistreatment."

      "Ukraine is in the final stages of drafting recruitment reforms to attract 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization as it looks for ways to bolster its fighting force",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine is in the final stages of drafting recruitment reforms to attract 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization as it looks for ways to bolster its fighting force, the battlefield commander recently appointed to the President\u2019s Office said.",
      "In his first interview with foreign media since taking up his new position last fall, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Colonel Pavlo Palisa said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system inherited from Soviet times is hindering progress.",
      "While Ukraine passed a mobilization law last spring and lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 years old, the measures have not had the impact needed to replenish its ranks or replace battlefield losses in its war with Russia.",
      "One initiative is what Palisa described as an \u201chonest contract,\" a plan that includes financial incentives, clear guarantees for training, and measures to ensure dialogue between soldiers and their commanders. The plan is aimed at attracting mainly 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization, and will also target Ukrainians who have the right to deferment or were discharged after the mobilization law was passed.",
      "\u201cTo secure the unit commander and the contract soldier, establish open and professional relations between them, and set clear boundaries that are understandable to both,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cIn my opinion, this is essential for effective dialogue.\u201d",
      "The effort, which Palisa said is in its final stages, could help respond to calls aired by both the Biden and Trump administrations that Ukraine could expand its manpower by lowering the conscription age.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamantly opposed to implementing obligatory mobilization starting from 18 years old, saying doing so would radically affect the future prospects of the war-weary country.",
      "\u201cAs of now, my view is that we need to start an open dialogue with society,\u201d Palisa said. \u201cBecause the defense of the state is not only the responsibility of the Armed Forces. It is the duty of every Ukrainian citizen, and it is their obligation.\u201d",
      "Palisa said his office, in collaboration with the Cabinet and the Ministry of Defense, is reviewing why mobilization efforts have fallen short.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a huge mobilization resource. In my opinion, at the moment, it is greater than what we currently need to address certain tasks on the frontline,\" he said. \u201cThe mechanism we currently have does not allow us to be as effective as we could be.\u201d",
      "Palisa was taken straight from the battlefield to the president\u2019s office, and he sees his appointment as an attempt to tackle systemic issues within the military. Part of a new generation of Ukrainian military leadership, he was studying at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "He graduated remotely in the summer of 2022 while fighting on the frontline. He then commanded the 93rd Brigade \u201cKholodnyi Yar,\u201d during the grueling nine-month battle for Bakhmut.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique opportunity to bring pressing military issues to the attention of the country\u2019s top leadership,\u201d he said, adding that he intends to return to his battlefield role once his mission is complete.",
      "With Russia continuing to make incremental advances in the Donetsk region, some analysts have pointed to structural weaknesses in Ukraine\u2019s command system and faltering communication between the units on the frontline as a key factor in its struggle to hold territory along the 1000 km (620 mile) frontline.",
      "Since the beginning of Moscow's full-scale invasion, Ukraine\u2019s army has expanded significantly but years of resisting Russian advances has left little time for strategic management \u2014 a gap that now threatens to jeopardize Ukraine\u2019s chances of success.",
      "Palisa says there's an urgent need for reforms to improve coordination and effectiveness.",
      "\u201d(We need) to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what needs to be done. There is no other way.\u201d"

      "MADRID -- More than 550 migrants have arrived in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands in boats over the past two days, Spain\u2019s maritime rescue service said Thursday. At least one body was found in one of the boats.",
      "The Spanish archipelago off northwest Africa is continuing to experience large numbers of migrant arrivals as more people mainly from West Africa attempt the dangerous Atlantic crossing in ramshackle boats. In the first half of January, 3,409 migrants reached Spain by sea, the vast majority to the Canaries, Interior Ministry figures showed. About as many migrants came illegally during the same period last year.",
      "In 2024, Spain received a record number of migrants who crossed illegally via sea, with more than 61,000 people having arrived on boats. Nearly 47,000 of those landed in the Canary Islands. They included several thousand unaccompanied minors.",
      "The islands are roughly 65 miles (105 kilometers) from the closest point in Africa, but to avoid security forces, many migrants attempt longer journeys that can take days or weeks. The majority last year departed from Mauritania, which is at least 473 miles (762 kilometers) from the closest Canary Island, El Hierro.",
      "Earlier this month, the Spanish migration rights group Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders) said that 50 people had died in the capsizing of a boat on its way to the Canary Islands. It reported that 44 of them were from Pakistan.",
      "The European Union's border agency, Frontex, said irregular crossings into the bloc in 2024 fell 38% overall but rose by 18% on the Atlantic route between West Africa and the Canary Islands. It attributed the rise in part to more migrants leaving from Mauritania, which has become a primary point of departure for people attempting to reach Europe.",
      "The International Organization for Migration recorded at least 5,000 migrants who died or went missing on the migratory route since it began keeping records in 2014. But Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders) says the real death toll is significantly higher, and that over 10,000 people died or went missing while attempting the route last year alone.",
      "Caminando Fronteras says it compiles its own figures from families of migrants and rescue statistics."

      "Prince Faisal bin Farhan's visit comes almost two months after a ceasefire went into effect that halted Israel and the Hezbollah group's war that battered southern Lebanon and destroyed much of the group's military capabilities. It also comes following a lightening insurgency in Syria in December that ousted Bashar Assad and ended decades of his family's rule.",
      "Lebanon this month elected its first president in over two years and appointed a new prime minister. The ascension of both army chief General Joseph Aoun as president, as well as diplomat and former head of the International Criminal Court Nawaf Salam as prime minister-elect, are both seen as major blows to the Hezbollah group.",
      "Bin Farhan is set to meet President Joseph Aoun, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, and outgoing caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.",
      "Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have been concerned about Iran-backed Hezbollah and allies' rising influence in government, and eventually led to a diplomatic crisis in 2021. Riyadh had been critical of Lebanese authorities' failure to combat drug smuggling from the tiny country into the kingdom, and eventually imposed punitive measures following televised remarks of Lebanon's information minister where he criticized Riyadh's war in Yemen against the Houthis.",
      "Riyadh banned imports coming from Lebanese, which compounded economic pain for Lebanese farmers and industrialists as the country was in the throes of an economic crisis that crippled its banks and pulled many in poverty. Lebanese authorities have since unsuccessfully tried to convince Saudi Arabia to reverse the ban.",
      "Lebanon for years has aspired to rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which for years have been key trade partners and whose nationals came to Lebanon boosting its tourism economy. It's a critical time for the country which mired in an economic crisis, but needs billions to rebuild dozens of towns and villages battered by war."

      "Karim Khan said in a statement he asked judges to approve warrants for the group\u2019s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhunzada, and the head of Afghanistan's Supreme Court, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, accusing the men of crimes against humanity for gender-based persecution.",
      "\u201cThese applications recognize that Afghan women and girls as well as the LGBTQI+ community are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable and ongoing persecution by the Taliban,\u201d Khan said.",

      "\u201cTheir systematic violations of women and girls\u2019 rights, including education bans, and the suppression of those speaking up for women\u2019s rights, have accelerated with complete impunity. With no justice in sight in Afghanistan, the warrant requests offer an essential pathway to a measure of accountability,\u201d Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.",
      "It is the first time in the court\u2019s history that attacks on the LGBTQ+ community have been considered a crime against humanity.",
      "Judges at the The Hague-based court approved a request in 2022 from the prosecutor to reopen the investigation into Afghanistan. The probe was shelved after Kabul said it could handle the investigation.",
      "Khan said he wanted to reopen the inquiry because under the Taliban, there was \u201cno longer the prospect of genuine and effective domestic investigations\u201d in Afghanistan.",
      "However, human rights groups criticized Khan's decision to focus on crimes committed by the Taliban and the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State group. He said he would \u201cdeprioritize\u201d other aspects of the investigation, such as crimes committed by Americans.",

      "There is no deadline for judges to rule on a request for a warrant, but a decision typically takes around four months. It took a pre-trial chamber three weeks to issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023 but six months in the case of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year.",

      "MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte -- Students in the French territory of Mayotte are preparing to return to school on Monday, just over six weeks after the worst cyclone to hit the islands off Africa in nearly a century laid waste to entire neighborhoods and villages and left widespread devastation in its wake.",
      "Teachers called back into work this week found many of their classrooms were missing a roof, or several windows. It remains unclear how many students will have a table and chair to sit at when they head back to learning.",
      "At the Lyc\u00e9e de Petite Terre high school in the town of Pamandzi, locals and firefighters are busy working to consolidate the framework of some of the main buildings, covering the gaping holes in the roofs with clear tarpaulin.",
      "Efforts to repair the archipelago's damaged schools have been underway since Cyclone Chido struck in December, in a race against the clock to make schools safe for students.",
      "After the passage of another tropical storm this month, the return of teachers had to be postponed, with some 120,000 students expected to come back gradually next week.",
      "Assistant headmistress Peggy Guillerez noted that while the damage at Lyc\u00e9e de Petite Terre, which has some 2,000 students, was less severe than at some other schools, several classrooms remain unusable.",
      "\u201cWe had built an excellent student union building, but it was largely destroyed,\u201d she said. \u201cOverall, however, only 12 rooms are out of use, which is minimal considering the size of our school.\u201d",
      "Many buildings were left without usable furniture, and some facilities remain uninhabitable.",
      "Colonel Olivier Bruy\u00e8re, a firefighter heading a team overseeing the reconstruction effort, said his team had deployed more than 60 people to secure the site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve removed anything that could cause injuries and are covering every possible spot with tarpaulins to keep the buildings dry,\u201d Bruy\u00e8re said. \u201cWe have also removed wet, collapsed ceilings and rebuilt wooden frameworks where possible.\u201d",
      "Many students and teachers are still struggling with a lack of shelter, electricity and running water, and it is unclear how many will be able to return to school. Around 300 teachers went on strike on Thursday to denounce the conditions under which pupils are returning to school. They also demanded financial help for colleagues who have lost their homes.",
      "Chido was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years, authorities said. While 39 deaths have been confirmed, French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou warned on a visit to the islands that the final death toll could be several hundred.",
      "Authorities have faced challenges in recording the deaths and injuries from the storm because many of those affected were undocumented migrants, and also because of the Muslim practice of burying people within 24 hours of them dying."

      "LONDON -- Google's Android and Apple's iOS are facing fresh scrutiny from Britain's competition watchdog, which announced investigations Thursday targeting the two tech giants' mobile phone ecosystems under new powers to crack down on digital market abuses.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said it launched separate investigations to determine whether the mobile ecosystems controlled by Apple and Google should be given \u201cstrategic market status\u201d that would mandate changes in the companies' practices.",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's opposition leader vowed Thursday to bar people from entering the country without proper papers and to step up deportations if he is elected chancellor next month, as a knife attack by a rejected asylum-seeker spilled over into an election campaign in which he is the front-runner.",
      "Two people, including a 2-year-old boy, were killed and three injured Wednesday in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg. The suspect, arrested shortly afterward, is a 28-year-old Afghan with a history of psychiatric problems and violence who said over a month ago that he would leave Germany voluntarily.",
      "His asylum application was rejected in 2023 and authorities failed to send him back to Bulgaria, where he first arrived in the European Union, according to Bavarian officials, who pointed the finger at the federal migration office.",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose center-left party trails in polls ahead of Germany's Feb. 23 election, met the heads of the country's security services on Wednesday evening and said they will \u201cdraw the necessary consequences. Now.\u201d He didn't specify what those would be.",

      "Merz said that if he becomes chancellor, he would order the Interior Ministry on his first day in office to control all of Germany's borders permanently and \u201cturn back all attempts at illegal entry without exception.\" He argued that EU rules are \u201crecognizably dysfunctional\" and Germany must exert a right to the primacy of national law.",
      "Merz added that people who are supposed to leave the country must no longer be let go if they are picked up by police and should be taken into custody and deported as quickly as possible, helped by an increase in detention capacity.",

In last month\u2019s Christmas market car ramming attack in Magdeburg, the suspect is a Saudi doctor who had come to various regional authorities\u2019 attention in the past.",
      "Mainstream parties are feeling pressure from the strong poll ratings of the far-right Alternative for Germany, with which all say they won't work after the election. Discontent about migration is a mainstay of its support, which recent surveys show at about 20%, putting it in second place.",

      "German authorities have said that 229,751 people applied for asylum in Germany last year, a 30% decrease from the previous year. There were 18,384 deportations in the year's first 11 months, compared with 16,430 in all of 2023.",

With the storm bringing gusts of wind around 100 m.p.h. (161 k.p.h.), forecasters are warning of a danger to life.",
      "Ireland\u2019s Met \u00c9ireann has issued a rare nationwide red warning, the most serious, for wind across the country between 2 a.m. and 10 p.m. It said there\u2019s a possible \u201cdanger to life\u201d as well as \u201cextremely dangerous travelling conditions\u201d and the prospect of \u201ccoastal flooding in low-lying and exposed areas\u201d",

      "The U.K.\u2019s Met Office has also issued a red warning for wind for Northern Ireland as well as central and southwestern areas of Scotland on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe reserve the issuing of Red Warnings for the most severe weather which represents a likely danger to life and severe disruption, and that is the case with Storm \u00c9owyn,\" the agency's chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said.",
      "Gundersen said winds could gust 80-90 m.p.h. quite widely for a time, and potentially up to 100 m.p.h. for exposed coasts in particular. The record for a gust in Northern Ireland is 124 m.p.h. in County Down in January 1974",
      "This is the first red warning issued for Northern Ireland since the Met Office moved to impact-based warnings in 2011. All schools in Northern Ireland have been advised to close on Friday.",

      "The other nations of the U.K. \u2014 England and Wales \u2014 will also face disruption, with all parts of the country covered by one warning at some point on Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that even those away from the immediate Red Warning areas will still likely see disruptive weather, with travel plans likely to be severely impacted, as well as the possibility of power cuts for some,\" said Gundersen.",
      "Dr Ambrogio Volont\u00e9, senior research fellow at the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said \u00c9owyn's structure mirrors some of the \u201cmost formidable storms of recent decades,\u201d and its \u201cpredicted intensity puts it firmly in the ranks of the strongest we\u2019ve experienced.\u201d"

      "A court in the city of Suzhou said Zhou Jiasheng, 52, stabbed the three because he was indebted and did not want to live any longer, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday.",
      "The case was one of two stabbing attacks on Japanese children in China last year that raised concerns about increased anti-Japanese sentiment in the country. Tokyo asked Beijing to ensure the safety of its citizens in China.",
      "Hayashi said the court ruling, which was not immediately available, made no reference to Japan.",
      "\u201cWe believe the crime that killed and injured the innocent people including a child was absolutely unforgivable, and we take the ruling seriously,\u201d Hayashi said.",
      "He said officials from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai were present at the court sentencing.",
      "The stabbing occurred at a bus stop for a Japanese school in Suzhou on June 24. A female bus attendant, Hu Youping, who tried to stop the attack died of stab wounds days later. The Japanese mother and child were not seriously injured.",
      "In September, a 10-year-old Japanese student died after being stabbed near his school in the southern city of Shenzhen.",
      "Other stabbing attacks involving foreigners last year were isolated incidents, the Chinese government said.",

      "Prince Faisal bin Farhan's visit comes almost two months after a ceasefire went into effect that halted Israel and the Hezbollah group's war that battered southern Lebanon and destroyed much of the group's military capabilities. It also comes following a lightening insurgency in Syria in December that ousted Bashar Assad and ended decades of his family's rule.",
      "Lebanon this month elected its first president in over two years and appointed a new prime minister. The ascension of both army chief General Joseph Aoun as president, as well as diplomat and former head of the International Criminal Court Nawaf Salam as prime minister-elect, are both seen as major blows to the Hezbollah group.",

      "Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have been concerned about Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies' rising influence in the government, and the situation eventually led to a diplomatic crisis in 2021. Riyadh had been critical of Lebanese authorities' failure to combat drug smuggling from Lebanon into Saudi Arabia, and eventually imposed punitive measures following televised remarks of Lebanon's information minister where he criticized Riyadh's war in Yemen against the Houthis.",

Lebanese authorities have since unsuccessfully tried to convince Saudi Arabia to reverse the ban.",

      "The promise is not new, but still hard for many to believe: 100% of profits from the sale of Newman\u2019s Own foods, like salad dressings, pasta sauce and popcorn, are donated to charity.",
      "And to celebrate what would have been company founder Paul Newman \u2019s 100th birthday on Jan. 26, the Newman's Own Foundation is inviting others to join them in that commitment, as part of the 100% for Purpose Club.",
      "In a TED talk released Thursday, Alex Amouyel, the foundation\u2019s CEO and president, made the case for why more for-profit companies should donate all of their profits to social causes. She also pledged that the foundation will provide guidance and advice to organizations that want to make the switch.",
      "\u201cIt is trying to be a proof point and trying to serve as a model for a completely different type of organization,\u201d Amouyel told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "Newman, who was a megawatt, Oscar-winning Hollywood star and whose face adorns all the product's labels, founded the food company in 1982. When he died in 2008, he donated it to his foundation.",
      "Newman's Own's structure is not one-of-a-kind, but it is unusual, especially in the U.S.",
      "Companies and founders reach out informally all the time, Amouyel said, and she hopes that more will seriously consider it. An Australian company, Humanitix, also donates 100% of their profits from selling event tickets to charity and is the second founding member of The 100% for Purpose Club.",
      "It is easier for companies to follow the Newman's Own model after Congress passed the Philanthropic Enterprise Act in 2018. The company lobbied for the legislation for years because after Newman's death, they found themselves in a bit of dilemma, said Celia Roady, a partner at Morgan Lewis and an attorney for Newman\u2019s Own Foundation.",
      "At the time, foundations were prohibited from owning more than 20% of any company in an effort to ensure that they focused on their charitable work. The Philanthropic Enterprise Act, which then-President Donald Trump signed into law, allows foundations to own corporations with some conditions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not trying to open up any big loopholes,\u201d Roady said, but instead pursued narrow changes \u201cthat would let companies that were wanting to give it all away to be owned by a private foundation, which seems like a logical owner for a company that has that kind of initiative.\u201d",
      "Those conditions were that the foundation must own the company entirely, that the company must donate 100% of its profits to charity, that a majority of the foundation\u2019s board must be independent of both the company and the donor, and that the donor may no longer be involved in the company\u2019s operation.",
      "In launching an invitation for companies to join them, Newman's Own is also offering other levels of participation for companies that have committed a smaller percentage of their profits to charity or resources for companies or employees to learn more about how their organization might donate more of their profits to a social purpose. Amouyel said they know other foundations or companies may pursue different structures.",
      "Humanitix is organized differently, in part because they are incorporated in Australia. Another high-profile example, the outdoor clothing company Patagonia, reorganized in 2022 to transfer its ownership to a trust and to donate its profits to a nonprofit advocacy organization that will campaign to protect the planet.",
      "Amouyel said these models offer a path forward for those who believe that capitalism works better than any other system, but isn\u2019t working well enough to do good in the world.",
      "\u201cThis allows you to use its power and to generate money, but then to make sure that the money is not about making rich people richer and richer and richer,\u201d she said, adding that she knows this won't work for all businesses or sectors, but thinks it can work for more.",
      "Nien-h\u00ea Hsieh, a professor at Harvard Business School, has studied Patagonia's transformation and he sees value in having different ownership models and a diversity of organizational forms across the economy.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s a concern about monopoly or concentrated ownership\" or \"the idea that, if you have a broader array or diverse array of shareholders, that may lead companies to focus on different kinds of ends and goals and be aware of some of the harms they\u2019re causing,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2022, Newman's Own said it had given away $600 million to charities over the years, with a focus on supporting children. Newman founded a network of camps for seriously ill kids, which continue to operate across the country today, like Camp Boggy Creek near Orlando, Florida, which provides a free experience for campers and their families. The foundation also supports nutrition education in schools and food justice for Indigenous communities.",
      "So far, it's not clear that any other companies have used the Philanthropic Enterprise Act to donate a company to be fully owned by a foundation and to give away 100% of its profits. But Roady, the attorney for Newman's Own, thinks it's still too early to judge the law's impact.",
      "\u201cIn the scheme of things, the legislation is still pretty recent,\" she said. \"And so there\u2019s still lots of time.\u201d",

      "Before deleting your Facebook account, you should download a copy of all your personal information, which includes details about your activity on the platform, things you've shared and data that the company has collected about you.",
      "You'll have to go to your settings or the accounts center \u2014 the master control panel for all your Meta accounts \u2014 where you can choose to download everything or just items such as your profile, posts, messages, comments and reactions, and list of friends, even the ads you\u2019ve clicked on and IP addresses you\u2019ve used to connect to Facebook.",
      "You can download information from a certain date range, such as the past month or six months, or for all the time you've had an account. If you're downloading photos, you can select their quality level: low, medium, high.",
      "For security purposes, you'll only have four days to download your file. The process is similar for Instagram and Threads users.",
      "Instagram users will need a password to download and access files and it could take up to 30 days to receive a download link by email, the platform says on its help page.",
      "Maybe you don\u2019t want to download all your personal information but instead want to get any photos and videos you've posted. Facebook provides a separate option to transfer these files to another online service, with options including Google Photos, Dropbox or Photobucket.",
      "A tip for Facebook users: before you pull the plug, check if you have friends or connections you don\u2019t want to lose complete contact with.",
      "Send them a message asking for their phone, email or other non-Meta contact details. You could also make a final post telling people that you\u2019re leaving, though there\u2019s a chance not everyone will see it.",
      "If you're not ready to go all the way, Facebook allows users to temporarily shut down their accounts in case they just want to take a break from social media.",
      "You can do this through the account center, where you can click on the Personal details section, and then the Account ownership and control setting.",
      "Temporarily deactivating an account means other users won't see it anymore, but your posts, photos and videos won't be deleted and you can still use Facebook Messenger. You can reactivate the account at any time.",
      "Don't change your mind too often: Instagram and Threads users can only temporarily deactivate their accounts once a week.",
      "Ready to take the plunge and delete your account permanently?",
      "After tying up any loose ends, head back to the accounts center, click the Personal details section, and then Account ownership and control, where you can choose to delete it.",
      "Once you've triggered the deletion process, you've got 30 days to change your mind, which you can do by logging back into your account and clicking the Cancel Deletion button.",
      "\u201cAfter 30 days, your account and all your information will be permanently deleted, and you won\u2019t be able to retrieve your information,\u201d Facebook warns on its help center.",
      "Take note: Deleting a Threads account won't have any effect on your corresponding Instagram account. But deleting an Instagram account will also result in the deletion of the linked Threads account because Instagram accounts are used to manage Threads accounts.",
      "Meta also owns WhatsApp, although Zuckerberg's content policy changes aren't likely to affect the chat app.",
      "Similar to Meta's social platforms, WhatsApp users can export a copy of their chat history or ask for information on their settings or channels.",
      "If you decide you want to get rid of WhatsApp and perhaps switch to competing chat services like iMessage or Signal, it's easy to do through the app's settings.",
      "Deleting WhatsApp will erase your account info, your chat history backup and your presence from any chat groups as well as any channels you set up where you're the only admin.",

      "Officials say a waitress who jumped out of a burning hotel at a popular ski resort has succumbed to her injuries",
      "ANKARA, Turkey -- A waitress who was in serious condition after jumping out of a burning hotel at a popular ski resort has succumbed to her injuries, officials and reports said Thursday, becoming the latest victim of a tragedy that has shocked the nation and revived concerns over lax safety regulations in the country.",
      "Turkish officials early on Thursday revised the number of deaths from Tuesday\u2019s blaze at the 12-story Grand Kartal hotel in Kartalkaya, in northwestern Bolu province, from 79 to 78, including Sevval Sahin. The 25-year-old waitress died in the intensive care unit of a hospital late Wednesday. Dozens of others were injured in the blaze.",
      "The government has appointed six prosecutors to lead an investigation into the cause of the fire, which came at the start of a two-week winter break for schools, when hotels in the area are filled to capacity. Authorities have detained 11 people for questioning, including the hotel\u2019s owner, Bolu\u2019s deputy mayor and the acting fire department chief. No charges have been brought yet.",
      "The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has traded accusations of blame with the Bolu municipality, which is controlled by Turkey\u2019s main opposition party.",
      "The blaze appeared to have started at the restaurant section on the fourth floor of the wooden-clad hotel and spread quickly through to the upper floors. Guests and staff jumped out of windows to escape smoke and flame-filled rooms or dangled sheets out of windows to lower themselves out.",
      "Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy has stated that the hotel had been inspected in 2021 and 2014, and had a fire safety certificate. Bolu Mayor Tanju Ozcan has claimed that hotels in Kartalkaya are outside his municipality\u2019s jurisdiction and that the hotel\u2019s last fire department certificate dated back to 2007.",
      "Survivor accounts indicate that the hotel\u2019s fire detection system didn't function, that there were no sprinklers and that guests weren't able to locate the building\u2019s two fire escapes in the smoke-filled corridors. HaberTurk television and other media reports have suggested that the design of the fire escapes ended up spreading the blaze to other floors.",
      "Witnesses have also reported that the firefighters arrived 45 minutes after the fire was first reported.",
      "\u201cIf there was a fire escape, there\u2019s no way we\u2019d be able to find it,\u201d Hulya Karadag, a vacationer who survived the fire along with her daughter and two grandsons, told the IHA news agency.",
      "\u201cThere was (no fire alarm). That is the worst thing. If there was a fire alarm and we had been notified in advance, people would have acted more cautiously,\u201d said Karadag, whose room was on the lower section of the hotel and was able to escape out of a window by jumping on the roof of an extension.",
      "Describing the chaos in the corridors, Karadag said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t go two rooms forward, we were out of breath. On top of that, people were bumping into each other. We don\u2019t know who we bumped into. There were children, people were screaming as they collided into each other.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the country continued holding funerals for the deceased.",
      "In Ankara, classmates and teachers gathered to bid farewell to 12-year-old Ayse Maya Dogan and her parents, Aysemin Elif Dogan and Mehmet Cem Dogan, leaving a note on her coffin that read: \u201cOur dear girl. We love you very much. We will never forget you. You will always be sitting in our classroom.\u201d",
      "Esra Nazik, a 25-year-old cook who was Sahin\u2019s roommate, was buried in her hometown of Konya in central Turkey. Like Sahin, Nazik also died after jumping out of the building, the Sabah newspaper reported.",
      "Sahin, who had started working at the hotel just over a month ago, called her father from the 12th-floor window, asking him for advice on what to do before she leapt out of the building, local media reports said.",
      "The T24 news website quoted Sahin\u2019s cousin, Murat Bakir, as saying her father told her not to jump. The waitress nevertheless threw herself out of the building, no longer able to withstand the smoke and flames, the website reported."

      "Trump is no stranger to the gathering of CEOs, startup visionaries, government leaders, world-class academics and other elites who meet in the snowy Swiss town of Davos each January. He came twice during his first term.",
      "His barrage of executive orders including calling for a U.S. pullout from the Paris climate deal, creating a new agency to collect tariffs and a pause in a TikTok ban have fed the chatter in the Davos Congress Center corridors.",
      "His promotion of a business joint venture that could invest up to $500 billion in infrastructure tied to AI has drawn plaudits from tech-oriented executives in Davos, even if Trump ally and multibillionaire Elon Musk \u2014 who is not on hand \u2014 scoffed on his X social media platform that the partners \u201c don't actually have the money.\u201d",
      "Trump also drew praise from the U.N. chief.",
      "Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, during a question-and-answer session after his speech a day earlier that focused on the threats of global warming and ungoverned AI, credited Trump's efforts before the inauguration to help win a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "\"The negotiations were dragging, dragging, dragging. And then, all of a sudden, it happened,\" Guterres said as he also praised efforts by Qatar and Turkey. \u201cI think there was a large contribution of robust diplomacy of \u2014 at the time \u2014 the president-elect of the United States.\u201d",
      "Milei launched a diatribe against what he called the ills of \u201cwokeism\" and described a global struggle between libertarians \u2014 like him \u2014 and left-wing progressives. He slammed social welfare, feminism, identity politics and the fight against climate change.",
      "\u201cI have come here to tell you that while our battle is not won, there is now hope that our moral duty has been reborn as well as our historic responsibility to dismantle the ideological structure of this sick wokeism,\u201d Milei said.",
      "Trump and Musk are among leaders forming an alliance \u201cof all the nations that want to be free,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe common denominator for the countries that are failing is the mental virus of woke ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the great pandemic of our time that needs to be cured. It is the cancer that must be cut out.\u201d",
      "In a message read by his envoy to Davos, Pope Francis praised technological advancements but warned about the dangers AI could pose to \u201chuman dignity and fraternity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen used correctly, AI assists the human person in fulfilling his or her vocation in freedom and responsibility,\" Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana said, reading the message.",
      "\"AI must be ordered to the human person and become part of efforts to achieve greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations, which are more valuable than advances in the technical field,\u201d he added.",

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",
      "For Mistre, the fight is deeply personal. Sitting in her daughter\u2019s room, where she has kept the decor untouched for the last three years, she said parents must know about the dangers of social media.",
      "Had she known about the content being sent to her daughter, she never would have allowed her on TikTok, she said. Her voice breaks as she describes Marie as a \u201csunny, funny\u201d teenager who dreamed of becoming a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIn memory of Marie, I will fight as long as I have the strength,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to know the truth. We must confront these platforms and demand accountability.\u201d",

      "Masahiro Nakai, one of Japan's top TV hosts and a former pop star, says he is retiring to take responsibility over sexual assault allegations",
      "TOKYO -- Masahiro Nakai, one of Japan\u2019s top TV hosts and a former pop star, said Thursday he was retiring to take responsibility over sexual assault allegations that are part of a wave roiling Japan's entertainment industry and have triggered an avalanche of lost advertising at one of the networks where he worked.",
      "Weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported in December that Nakai had reached a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize. He acknowledged \u201ca trouble\u201d and a settlement, while denying any violence, in a statement earlier this month. The magazine has also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "\u201cI, Masahiro Nakai, is retiring from entertainment activity as of today,\u201d Nakai said in a statement distributed to his paid fan club and posted on social media by apparent members. Japanese media also confirmed and reported his retirement.",
      "\u201cI am truly sorry for causing trouble and losses to so many people,\u201d Nakai said, and repeated his \u201csincere apology\u201d to the woman. \u201cI'm really, really sorry for saying good-bye this way ... Sayonara.\u201d",
      "Japan\u2019s entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged, SMAP.",
      "Last Friday, Fuji TV President Koichi Minato acknowledged the company had been aware of the problem six months before the magazine report and hadn't disclosed it. Minato apologized and said Fuji TV would investigate the case but also said he believed his employees had not done anything wrong.",
      "After dozens of commercials were withdrawn, Fuji TV apologized for causing trouble to advertisers and agencies but declined to disclose details.",
      "Fuji Television Network\u2019s vice-chairperson Ryunosuke Endo, who is also head of Japanese commercial broadcasters\u2019 association, in a news conference Thursday said he learned about the problem in December when he was asked for a comment about the scandal and \u201cwas extremely shocked.\u201d Endo said the problem was kept confidential among a handful of people, which did not include him, to protect the victim's privacy and stand by her.",
      "He said his company should prioritize regaining trust by explaining what happened through an appropriate third-party investigation.",
      "Separately, Fuji TV and its parent company Fuji Media Holdings held a board meeting Thursday and announced that they have set up an independent panel of lawyers and in line with guidelines set by the Japan Federation of Bar Associations.",
      "They met following shareholders' demands for further clarification about the scandal and steps the company had taken and what measures are planned,",
      "Nakai said in his statement that he has sorted out all negotiations of terminating his shows and contracts with television, radio and sponsors. He said he has yet to taken all his responsibility and promised to \u201cface various problems and respond sincerely.\u201d",
      "Endo noted Nakai\u2019s retirement was his \u201cpersonal decision\u201d but said Nakai was part of the upcoming investigation and that he hoped for his sincere cooperation.",
      "Endo acknowledged attending a number of parties years ago accompanied by female announcers known as \u201cjoshi anna,\u201d who often appear as assistants on entertainment shows. He said the parties were for networking and business, but noted the culture might have resulted from male-dominated decision-making.",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince says the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump mused about returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince said Thursday the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump earlier put a price tag on returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip.",
      "Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Trump. It marked Trump's first call with a foreign leader since his inauguration Monday.",
      "\u201cThe crown prince affirmed the kingdom\u2019s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\u201d the report said.",
      "The readout did not elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which once was the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "The White House on Thursday issued a statement acknowledging the call, saying the two leaders \u201cdiscussed efforts to bring stability to the Middle East, bolster regional security and combat terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cAdditionally, they discussed the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s international economic ambitions over the next four years as well as trade and other opportunities to increase the mutual prosperity of the United State and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\u201d the statement said, without elaborating.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017.",
      "\u201cThe first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\u201d Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 \u2014 we\u2019ll up it for all the inflation \u2014 I think I\u2019d probably go.\u201d",
      "On a potential trip to Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told journalists Thursday: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any plans at this time.\u201d",
      "Trump's 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom.",
      "Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",
      "The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues.",
      "Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia's western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars' worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of it hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",

    "story": [
      "The Chinese government is trying to encourage people to spend more by ensuring that share prices will rise, ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stock markets",
      "BANGKOK -- The Chinese government is trying to encourage people to spend more by ensuring that share prices will rise, ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks to help jolt its languid markets out of the doldrums.",
      "Officials told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that beginning this year mutual funds should increase holdings of onshore stocks, called A-shares, by at least 10% a year over the next three years.",
      "Commercial insurance funds will have to put 30% of their annual new premium revenue into share markets beginning this year, they said.",
      "\u201cThis means that at least several hundred billion yuan of long-term funds will be added to A-shares every year,\u201d said Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.",
      "The announcement followed a meeting of top financial officials including ministries in charge of pensions and the central bank.",
      "\u201cImplementing the plan's various measures will further enhance the equity allocation capacity of medium- and long-term funds, steadily expand the scale of investment, improve the supply and structure of funds in the capital market, and consolidate good conditions for the capital market\u2019s recovery,\u201d Wu said.",
      "The ruling Communist Party announced this move just ahead of China\u2019s biggest holiday of the year, the Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, Jan. 29. It\u2019s a time when families tend to splash out on food and travel and little red packets of money for children and young adults, a time of wishes for good fortune.",
      "Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai rose early Thursday after the announcement, with the Shanghai Composite index gaining 1.4%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong, a market linked to limited trading by mainland Chinese investors, shed early gains, edging 0.1% lower.",
      "China's share markets are huge but they hit their peak value before the 2008 global financial crisis and have meandered well below that level since. A lack of gains in share prices, along with falling housing prices, has discouraged Chinese families from spending, slowing consumer demand and economic growth.",
      "So far, the government's efforts to get people to spend more and save less have had mixed success. An initiative to promote purchases of energy efficient vehicles and appliances by paying subsidies to people who turn in their old versions of such items has boosted sales of such products. But share prices had traded stubbornly within a narrow range after a brief-lived rally late last year.",
      "Wu said pension funds will be required to revamp how they assess their performance and companies will be encouraged to conduct more share buybacks and pay higher dividends to give shareholders better returns.",
      "\u201cThis is a very important institutional breakthrough for the entry of medium- and long-term funds into the market. It can be said that it has solved a problem that has been unsolved for many years,\u201d he added.",
      "Sell-offs by major shareholders and high market volatility have handicapped the Chinese markets, Lei Meng, a China equity strategist at UBS Securities, said in a commentary Thursday.",
      "So, \u201cthe willingness of long-term investors to participate in the stock market has dwindled,\u201d Lei said. \u201cThe proposal of market value management reform directly addresses this issue because it is directly related to investors\u2019 sense of gain.\u201d",
      "But such moves have often failed in the past, since they attempt to override prevailing market sentiment by fiat.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, such efforts can be likened to attempting to kindle a fire with damp wood \u2014 often proving ineffective and short-lived,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary."

      "TOKYO -- Japan saw record-high exports last year, as its annual trade deficit declined 44% from the previous year, the Finance Ministry reported Thursday.",
      "The trade deficit, which measures the value of exports minus imports, totaled 5.3 trillion yen ($34 billion), according to government data, as imports ballooned on the back of rising energy costs and growing inflation around the world.",
      "Exports from the world\u2019s third-largest economy totaled 107.9 trillion yen ($691 billion), surpassing the 100 trillion yen mark for the second-straight year, and the biggest value on record for comparable data, which dates back to 1979, the ministry said.",
      "Some companies may have sped up their exports in anticipation of potential tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump has said he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting Feb. 1. During his campaign, he threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, although details on that remain unclear.",
      "For the month of December, exports gained a greater-than-expected 2.8% on-year, while imports rose 1.8%. Exports grew to Asian and European nations, while dipping slightly to the U.S.",
      "Imports grew most from India, Hong Kong and Iran.",
      "Demand was especially strong for Japan's vehicles, semiconductors and other machinery.",
      "The weakening yen, another recent trend, has the effect of inflating the value of imports. The U.S. dollar has been hovering at 150-yen levels, sometimes surpassing 160 yen, over the past year, while a year ago it was often at 140-yen levels.",
      "Japan has recorded a trade deficit for four straight years, but last year's deficit was considerably smaller than the 9.5 trillion yen deficit for 2023."

      "Costco is pushing back on a shareholder proposal that urges the wholesale club operator to conduct an evaluation of any business risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "NEW YORK -- Costco is pushing back on a shareholder proposal that urges the wholesale club operator to conduct an evaluation of any business risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Investors were expected to vote on the recommendation during the company's annual meeting Thursday.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, submitted the proposal, arguing that Costco's DEI initiatives hold \u201clitigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\u201d",
      "The think tank has made a similar proposal to Apple, and like some American companies that already scaled back or retreated from their diversity policies, cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Costco officials could not be reached for comment on the DEI proposal.",
      "But Costco's board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject the motion. The board said it believes \u201cour commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\u201d",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \u201ccreativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\u201d and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco can be confident the proposal will be rejected.",
      "\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco\u2019s management, and there's an attitude of \u2018Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.",
      "Costco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands, including Walmart,McDonald's and John Deere.",
      "Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \u201cdisheartening.\u201d",
      "Prominent technology companies, including Amazon and Meta \u2014 the parent company of Facebook and Instagram \u2014 also have rolled back DEI initiatives, which are expected to face opposition from the administration of President Donald Trump.",
      "Emboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "As for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\u201d If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.",
      "Costco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn\u2019t have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn\u2019t focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.",
      "Apple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \u201cto create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d",

      "The e-commerce giant said the move would provide \u201ceven more savings to our customers over the long run.\" However, a Canadian union that successfully unionized one warehouse accused the company of closing its sites to fend off organizing efforts in the region.",
      "The closures will eliminate about 1,700 permanent full-time jobs in the greater Montreal area, Amazon said. The warehouses also employ 250 temporary employees.",
      "Amazon said it would enlist local, third-party companies to deliver packages, reverting to a business model it used in Quebec before 2020.",
      "\u201cThis decision wasn\u2019t made lightly, and we\u2019re offering impacted employees a package that includes up to 14 weeks\u2019 pay after facilities close and transitional benefits, like job placement resources,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said in a statement.",
      "Agrait said the decision was made following a \u201crecent review\u201d of the company's operations in the province. The closing sites include one fulfillment center, two sorting centers, three delivery stations and a facility Amazon dubs AMXL because it aids in the shipment of large goods such as TVs and furniture.",

      "About 240 Amazon workers at a company warehouse in Laval, a Montreal suburb, unionized in May, becoming the first of the tech company\u2019s Canadian warehouses to do so. Amazon challenged the union's right to represent the workers but lost at a provincial labor tribunal in October.",
      "Caroline Senneville, president of the union involved with the organizing in Laval, said she has \u201cno doubt\u201d that Wednesday\u2019s closures, which she called \u201ca slap in the face for all Quebec workers,\u201d were part of an anti-union campaign.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a move that runs counter to the provisions of the Labour Code, and one we\u2019ll be taking a firm stand against,\u201d she said in a press release.",
      "Michael Lynk, a Western University professor emeritus of law, said he saw Amazon's move as \u201ca labor relations \u2018Groundhog Day'\" for Quebec, where a similar situation played out 20 years ago with Walmart Canada.",
      "Walmart closed a store in Jonquiere, Quebec, citing profitability troubles just months after workers there received union certification.",

In an attempt to make the technology even more indispensable, the AI on Galaxy S25 will be able to create customized digital dossiers on users' behavior patterns and other unique characteristics that Samsung is calling a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything you see here is the beginning of a new reality,\" said TM Roh, the Samsung executive who oversees its smartphones. \u201cThings that you thought you could never do, but now you can.\u201d",
      "As Apple has been doing with its AI features, Samsung is promising that its technology will shield users' privacy while also peering into their lives. Samsung is providing the protection primarily by keeping all the knowledge accrued by its AI technology on the Galaxy devices \u2014 within a digital fortress the company nicknamed after Fort Knox, the Kentucky Army base seated next to the U.S. government\u2019s depository for gold.",
      "After raising prices last year, Samsung is standing pat with the Galaxy S25 phones, with the standard model starting at $800, the Plus model at $1,000 and the Ultra model at $1,300. The phones are scheduled to be in stores starting Feb. 7.",
      "Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson thinks the Galaxy S25 models \u201cwill offer a more intuitive user experience with more integrated vocal and cross-app experiences, but AI is not yet a key reason to buy a new smartphone.\u201d",
      "Samsung is doubling down on its AI bet after getting a sales bump from the past year's emphasis on the technology. The South Korean company sold 32 million of its Galaxy S24 models from January through September last year, a 25% increase from the same time in the previous year, according to the research group Canalys.",
      "But Samsung didn\u2019t fare as well in the lower end of the smartphone market, where it was hurt by cheaper devices made by Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one of the reasons Samsung\u2019s total smartphone shipments fell by 1% last year, leaving it slightly behind Apple in the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Crop.",
      "As was the case with last year\u2019s models, the Galaxy S25 will draw heavily on AI technology made by Google, the maker of the free operating system Android that Samsung has long used for its smartphones.",
      "Some of the new AI tricks, such as the ability to deploy Google's \u201ccircle to search\u201d technology to quickly identify the song title of music playing in a video, will debut on the Galaxy S25 before coming to other Android phones later this year. Google also has been planting more AI on its own phone, the Pixel, but that device still lags far behind the iPhone and Galaxy."

    "summary": "Starbucks&rsquo; decision to restrict its restrooms to paying customers has flushed out a wider problem: a patchwork of restroom use policies that varies by state and city",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks\u2019 decision to restrict its restrooms to paying customers has flushed out a wider problem: a patchwork of restroom use policies that varies by state and city",
      "Starbucks\u2019 decision to restrict its restrooms to paying customers has flushed out a wider problem: a patchwork of restroom policies that has left Americans confused and divided over who gets to use the loo and when.",
      "Rules about restroom access in restaurants vary by state, city and county. New York requires restroom access for customers at food establishments with 20 or more seats. California requires larger restaurants to provide restrooms for customers and guests, but only if they were built after 1984. In Chicago, restaurants don\u2019t need to have restrooms for customers unless they serve liquor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so mish-mash,\u201d said Steven Soifer, the co-founder and treasurer of the American Restroom Association, which advocates for clean, safe and well-designed public toilets. \u201cIf (a retailer) is serving food and drink, it\u2019s a health hazard if there isn\u2019t a public bathroom.\u201d",
      "Starbucks opened the can, so to speak, when it said last week it was reversing a 7-year-old policy that invited anyone to hang out in its stores or use the restroom, regardless of whether they bought anything. Starbucks\u2019 new code of conduct, which will be posted in all company-owned North American stores, also bans discrimination or harassment, consumption of outside alcohol, smoking, vaping, drug use and asking strangers for money.",
      "Reaction to the coffee chain's rule change for potty privileges was heated and divided. Many said Starbucks had the right to restrict restroom access to paying customers.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s up to Starbucks to set the atmosphere in their stores,\u201d Paul Skinner, 76, a retired firefighter in Daytona Beach, Florida, told The Associated Press. \u201cIf they\u2019ve decided that their paying customers are going to be better served by limiting restroom access, it doesn\u2019t make me mad. I\u2019m not going to stop going there.\u201d",
      "But Skinner said he also doesn\u2019t mind when homeless people occasionally visit his local Starbucks, and he sometimes offers to buy them breakfast.",
      "\u201cI think about all the people who don\u2019t have housing who would love to wander into a Starbucks and get warm,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there\u2019s one more place they aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d",
      "Other patrons lamented the change and said it didn\u2019t reflect Starbucks\u2019 often-stated goal of being a welcoming, community-oriented coffeehouse.",
      "Norman Bauman, 81, a semi-retired science writer in New York, said he stopped going to his local Starbucks to read, meet people and maybe buy a coffee when the store hung an \u201cEmployees Only\u201d sign on its sole restroom.",
      "\u201cI used to sit in a coffee shop once or twice a week and read my science journals. I always wondered how they could survive with customers like me,\u201d Bauman said.",
      "Social media posts ran the gamut. Some said the change was overdue, and that Starbucks' open-door policy had invited trouble and left fewer seats available for paying customers. But others criticized the company, saying the new policy made them much less likely to patronize Starbucks.",
      "Starbucks said its new code of conduct matched those of other big retailers. The Associated Press reached out to several other restaurant chains to ask about their restroom policies, including McDonald\u2019s and the parent companies of Dunkin\u2019, Burger King and KFC. None responded.",
      "But the National Retail Federation said businesses have a right to set limits on restroom use.",
      "\u201cStores and restaurants are private property, and these establishments have a right to enforce certain conduct in compliance with local, state and federal laws and regulations that ensures the health and safety of the customers they serve and the people they employ,\u201d the federation said in a statement.",
      "Starbucks stressed this week that the code of conduct is meant to end disruptive behavior.",
      "\u201cWe know there will be times when a customer needs to use the restroom before they\u2019ve made a purchase, or maybe uses the restroom and then decides against making a purchase, and of course that is OK,\u201d Starbucks spokeswoman Jaci Anderson said.",
      "Starbucks also said it will comply with any local laws requiring bathroom access for non-customers. But that\u2019s where things get murky.",
      "Most states and the District of Columbia follow the International Plumbing Code, which sets minimum regulations for plumbing systems. The code says businesses must make toilet facilities available to \u201ccustomers, patrons and visitors,\u201d said Soifer, who is an adjunct professor at the Adelphi University School of Social Work in addition to his duties at the American Restroom Association.",
      "But Andrew Rudansky, a spokesman for New York\u2019s Department of Buildings, said the International Code Council, which developed the plumbing code, has published separate commentary making clear that restrooms are intended for people \u201cinvolved with the activities of the establishment\u201d and not just passersby.",
      "Other states and cities use the Uniform Plumbing Code or the National Standard Plumbing Code as the basis for their regulations. Those codes also refer to restrooms as being for \u201ccustomers.\u201d",
      "But Soifer said even the term \u201ccustomer\u201d is ambiguous.",
      "\u201cIf I walk into a Starbucks and I\u2019m thinking of ordering something but I\u2019m not sure, am I a customer? Sure,\u201d he said. A homeless person may also be a customer, he pointed out, but might be discouraged from using the restroom.",
      "To add to the confusion, at least 20 states have passed versions of the Restroom Access Act, which requires retailers to let people with certain medical conditions, like Crohn\u2019s disease, use their restrooms, even if those restrooms are usually reserved for employees.",
      "The wider issue, Soifer said, is a lack of public restroom facilities in the U.S. If there were more public facilities, he said, there would be less pressure on retailers like Starbucks.",
      "\u201cThe number one complaint tourists have about visiting the U.S. is, \u2018Where are your public toilets?\u2019\u201d he said.",

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",
      "For Mistre, the fight is deeply personal. Sitting in her daughter\u2019s room, where she has kept the decor untouched for the last three years, she said parents must know about the dangers of social media.",
      "Had she known about the content being sent to her daughter, she never would have allowed her on TikTok, she said. Her voice breaks as she describes Marie as a \u201csunny, funny\u201d teenager who dreamed of becoming a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIn memory of Marie, I will fight as long as I have the strength,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to know the truth. We must confront these platforms and demand accountability.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is clashing with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project touted by President Donald Trump, the latest in a feud between the two tech billionaires that started on OpenAI's board and is now testing Musk's influence with the new president.",
      "Trump on Tuesday had talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, alongside Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, is already starting to build out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-evolving AI technology.",
      "Trump declared it \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration, with an initial private investment of $100 billion that could reach five times that sum.",
      "But Musk, a close Trump adviser who helped bankroll his campaign and now leads a government cost-cutting initiative, questioned the value of the investment hours later.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk wrote on his social platform X. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d",
      "Altman responded Wednesday to say Musk was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d and inviting Musk to come visit the first site in Texas that is already under construction.",
      "\"(T)his is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put (America) first,\u201d Altman wrote, using a U.S. flag emoji to represent America.",
      "The public clash over Stargate is part of a years-long dispute between Musk and Altman that began with a boardroom rivalry over who should run OpenAI, which both men helped found.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. A hearing is set for February in a California federal court.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI, that is building its own big data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "Tech news outlet The Information first reported on an OpenAI data center project called Stargate in March 2024, indicating that it's been in the works long before Trump announced it.",
      "Another company \u2014 Crusoe Energy Systems \u2014 announced in July it was building a large and \u201cspecially designed AI data center\u201d at the northwest edge of Abilene, Texas at a site run by energy technology company Lancium. Crusoe and Lancium said in a joint statement at the time that the project was \u201csupported by a multibillion-dollar investment\u201d but didn't disclose its backers.",
      "AI technology requires huge amounts of electricity to build and operate and both companies said the project would be powered with renewable sources such as nearby solar farms, in a way that Lancium CEO Michael McNamara said would \u201cdeliver the maximum amount of green energy at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Crusoe said it would own and develop the facility.",
      "It's not clear how and when that project became the first phase of the Stargate investment revealed by Trump. Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt said construction began about nine months ago but \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite this big. We thought it was going to be about a third of this size.\u201d",
      "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the Abilene project is the first of about 10 data center buildings currently being built and that number could expand to 20.",
      "Hurt told The Associated Press that the region surrounding Abilene, a city of about 130,000 people, benefits from a wealth of energy sources, including oil, gas, solar and some of the \u201clargest wind farms in the world,\u201d though Trump signaled opposition to wind power this week by temporarily halting approval of wind projects on federal lands.",
      "\u201cWe have the capability to produce the energy for this market so it really means a lot for a town like Abilene,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cTo have this opportunity here in west-central Texas, to have something like this to make Abilene substantial, we\u2019re just excited about it.\u201d",
      "Missing from Trump's press conference Tuesday was Microsoft, which has long supported OpenAI with billions of dollars in investments and enabling its data centers to be used to build the models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.",
      "Microsoft is also a technology partner in the Stargate project, along with chipmakers Nvidia and Arm, but put out a statement noting that its OpenAI partnership will \u201cevolve\u201d in a way that enables OpenAI \u201cto build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk's comments about the Stargate deal Wednesday during a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pivoted to his company's own $80 billion plan to build out its global AI infrastructure, of which $50 billion is being spent in the U.S.",

      "Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into the next version of its Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into its next lineup of Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere.",
      "The three Galaxy S25 models unveiled Wednesday in San Jose, California, are the second generation to be designed for the AI age \u2014 a craze that market-leading Apple joined last September with the release of the iPhone 16. Most of the hardware on the Galaxy S25 is mostly the same as last year's model, except for a faster chip and a more powerful ultrawide lens on the camera.",
      "In its next phase, Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 as an \u201cAI companion\u201d capable of pulling more requests out of conversations, learning people\u2019s routines, anticipating people's needs and performing more technological tricks, such as being able to remove unwanted sounds from videos or identifying the name of a song upon request.",
      "The AI on the new Galaxy phones has been designed to toggle from one app to another to fetch, summarize and manage information, entertainment and other content stored on the devices. In an attempt to make the technology even more indispensable, the AI on Galaxy S25 will be able to create customized digital dossiers on users' behavior patterns and other unique characteristics that Samsung is calling a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything you see here is the beginning of a new reality,\" said TM Roh, the Samsung executive who oversees its smartphones. \u201cThings that you thought you could never do, but now you can.\u201d",
      "As Apple has been doing with its AI features, Samsung is promising that its technology will shield users' privacy while also peering into their lives. Samsung is providing the protection primarily by keeping all the knowledge accrued by its AI technology on the Galaxy devices \u2014 within a digital fortress the company nicknamed after Fort Knox, the Kentucky Army base seated next to the U.S. government\u2019s depository for gold.",
      "After raising prices last year, Samsung is standing pat with the Galaxy S25 phones, with the standard model starting at $800, the Plus model at $1,000 and the Ultra model at $1,300. The phones are scheduled to be in stores starting Feb. 7.",
      "Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson thinks the Galaxy S25 models \u201cwill offer a more intuitive user experience with more integrated vocal and cross-app experiences, but AI is not yet a key reason to buy a new smartphone.\u201d",
      "Samsung is doubling down on its AI bet after getting a sales bump from the past year's emphasis on the technology. The South Korean company sold 32 million of its Galaxy S24 models from January through September last year, a 25% increase from the same time in the previous year, according to the research group Canalys.",
      "But Samsung didn\u2019t fare as well in the lower end of the smartphone market, where it was hurt by cheaper devices made by Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one of the reasons Samsung\u2019s total smartphone shipments fell by 1% last year, leaving it slightly behind Apple in the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Crop.",
      "As was the case with last year\u2019s models, the Galaxy S25 will draw heavily on AI technology made by Google, the maker of the free operating system Android that Samsung has long used for its smartphones.",
      "Some of the new AI tricks, such as the ability to deploy Google's \u201ccircle to search\u201d technology to quickly identify the song title of music playing in a video, will debut on the Galaxy S25 before coming to other Android phones later this year. Google also has been planting more AI on its own phone, the Pixel, but that device still lags far behind the iPhone and Galaxy.",

      "These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency as human hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimic high-pitched bird calls.",
      "Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they've never been measured before.",
      "\u201cThat opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,\u201d said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work.",
      "Scientists still aren\u2019t sure how the perturbations happen, but they think Earth\u2019s magnetic field may have something to do with it.",
      "The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft \u2014 NASA's Van Allen Probes \u2014 heard the chirps from Earth's radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection.",
      "The latest notes were picked up by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun's magnetic fields. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.",
      "\u201cThey are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,\u201d said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email.",
      "The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth's magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn't expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form.",
      "\u201cIt's very captivating, very compelling,\u201d Jaynes said. \u201cWe definitely need to find more of these events.\u201d",

      "The site \u2014 currently https://www.whitehouse.gov/es/ \u2014 now gives users an \u201cError 404\u201d message. It also included a \u201cGo Home\u201d button that directed viewers to a page featuring a video montage of Trump in his first term and on the campaign trail. The button was later updated to read \u201cGo To Home Page\u201d.",
      "Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion at the abrupt change and frustration at what some called the administration\u2019s lack of efforts to maintain communication with the Latino community, which helped propel him to the presidency.",
      "The Spanish profile of the White House\u2019 X, @LaCasaBlanca and the government page on reproductive freedom also were disbanded. Meanwhile, the Spanish versions of other government agencies such as the Department of Labor, Justice and Agriculture remained available for users on Tuesday.",
      "Asked about the changes, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields responded Tuesday that the administration is \u201ccommitted to bringing back online the Spanish translation section of the website.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s day two. We are in the process of developing, editing and tweaking the White House website. As part of this ongoing work, some of the archived content on the website went dormant. We are committed to reloading that content in a short timeline,\" he said without elaborating.",
      "Trump removed the Spanish version of the page in 2017. At that time, White House officials said they would reinstate it. President Joe Biden reinstated the page in 2021.",
      "The page's removal coincided with Trump\u2019s first-day wave of executive orders highlighted by the launch of an illegal immigration crackdown that was one of his key campaign pledges. Trump on Monday declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and announced plans to send U.S. troops to help support immigration agents and restrict refugees and asylum.",
      "According to 2023 Census Bureau estimates, about 43.4 million Americans \u2014 13.7% of the U.S. population age 5 and older \u2014 speak Spanish at home. The U.S. has no official language.",
      "Monica Rivera, a brand and communications strategist in New York City of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, said the shutdown sends a clear signal.",
      "\u201cThere are 43 million Latinos who speak Spanish as their first language and removing access to information directly from the White House draws a distinct line as to who they are serving and more dangerously, signals to the administration\u2019s MAGA base that we as Latinos are \u2018other\u2019 and a less significant part of this country,\" Rivera said.",
      "Anthony Hernandez, a paralegal in the nation's capital, wasn\u2019t initially aware of the move and said it suggests what the coming years of a second Trump presidency would look like, with specific issues making headlines while \u201cminor but equally malicious things like that go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA move like shutting down the Spanish White House page and X profile serves no purpose other than to cut off resources for millions of Hispanic Americans and immigrants attempting to enter the United States legally,\" Hernandez said. \"And it\u2019s a slap in the face to the millions of Hispanic voters that supported him in this recent election.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is Cuban American and speaks Spanish. At his swearing-in Tuesday, he gave remarks in Spanish, thanking God, his family and Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Hispanic leaders and communication strategy experts expressed surprise with the page's removal, given Trump\u2019s popularity with certain Latino voters.",
      "\u201cIf the White House is seriously interested in engaging with Latinos, the second largest group in this country, then they need to make sure that updates can also be distributed in Spanish, a preferred language for millions in our community,\u201d said Frankie Miranda President and CEO of the Hispanic Federation.",

      "Jeff Lee, former deputy cabinet secretary and deputy director of external and international affairs for former California Gov. Jerry Brown, said the move seems counterintuitive given the opportunity to \u201cshowcase\u201d policy changes, especially ones related to economics and border security.",

      "AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters, found Trump won a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, and most notably among men under age 45. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.",

      "President Donald Trump is talking up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, will start building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum.",
      "\u201cIt's big money and high quality people,\u201d said Trump, adding that it's \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration.",
      "Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024.",
      "\u201cThis will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI.",
      "Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of golden age,\u201d said Son, referencing Trump's statement that the U.S. would be in a \u201cgolden age\u201d with him back in the White House.",
      "Son, a billionaire based in Japan, already committed in December to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump's first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork.",
      "While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented.",
      "The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers.",
      "OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration\u2019s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects \u201ccan be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI.",
      "The push to build data centers predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally.",
      "Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks.",
      "The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses.",
      "Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being.",
      "CBS News first reported that Trump would be announcing the AI investment.",
      "Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending.",
      "Trump previously in January announced a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied to AI.",

      "TikTok\u2019s China-based parent ByteDance was supposed to find a U.S. buyer or be banned on Jan. 19. Trump\u2019s order could give ByteDance more time to find a buyer.",
      "\u201cI guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has amassed nearly 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. Yet its 170 million U.S. users could not access TikTok for more than 12 hours between Saturday night and Sunday morning.",
      "The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised to pause the ban on Monday, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.",
      "Business leaders, lawmakers, legal scholars, and influencers who make money on TikTok are watching to see how Trump tries to resolve a thicket of regulatory, legal, financial and geopolitical issues with his signature.",
      "TikTok's app allows users to create and watch short-form videos, and broke new ground by operating with an algorithm that fed viewers recommendations based on their viewing habits. But concerns about its potential to serve as a tool for Beijing to manipulate and spy on Americans pre-date Trump's first presidency.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued executive orders banning dealings with ByteDance and the owners of the Chinese messaging app WeChat. Courts ended up blocking the orders, but less than a year ago Congress overwhelmingly passed a law citing national security concerns to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold it to an approved buyer.",
      "The law, which went into force Sunday, allows for fines of up to $5,000 per U.S. TikTok user against major mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services like Oracle if they continued to distribute TikTok to U.S. users beyond the deadline for ByteDance's divestment.",
      "Trump on Sunday said he had asked TikTok's U.S. service providers to continue supporting the platform and app while he prepared to sign an executive order to stop the ban for now.",
      "\u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, his social networking site.",
      "The law that Congress passed and now-former President Joe Biden signed in April allowed for a 90-day extension if there had been progress toward a sale before the statute's effective date. Less certain is whether that provision can be applied retroactively, according to Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cExecutive orders cannot override existing laws,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the new president has that authority to issue the 90-day extension of a law that\u2019s already gone into effect.\u201d",
      "Kreps also doubts the conditions for a delay exist at this point without so much as even a potential buyer being named to prove that a sale was moving along.",
      "But Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, has written that the law also empowers the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture\u201d \u2014 suggesting Trump could have discretion to say whether or when ByteDance meets the terms of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.",
      "Although ByteDance spent months repeating it wasn't interested in selling, Beijing on Monday also signaled a possible easing on China's stance on TikTok to allow it to be divested from its Chinese parent company. China\u2019s vice president held meetings with Vice President JD Vance and Tesla tech titan Elon Musk on Sunday.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, said Monday that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "Until now, it was widely believed that Beijing would not allow the sale of TikTok, which had come to embody China\u2019s defiance in the face of \u201cU.S. robbery.\u201d However, TikTok was among several issues brought up in a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump on Friday, though details were not available.",
      "Trump later announced plans to delay the TikTok ban and suggested a joint venture in which the U.S. would get a 50% ownership of the app. Shou Zi Chew, TikTok\u2019s CEO, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.",
      "The Justice Department is generally tasked with enforcing the laws of the federal government, so it\u2019s possible that Trump will direct the DOJ to ignore the law. Such a move might itself be subject to legal scrutiny but would buy time for TikTok.",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to save TikTok may put him at odds with some of the House members and senators who voted for the law, which received broad bipartisan support. House Speaker Mike Johnson called ByteDance's ownership \u201ca very dangerous thing,\u201d and said he expected a full sale to happen.",
      "\u201cI think we will enforce the law,\u201d Johnson told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "Legislators now stand to \u201clook a little bit silly\u201d if the ban doesn\u2019t last, Kreps said.",
      "\u201c(The case) becomes about the separations of powers, and checks and balances, that we don\u2019t have a king who decides what happens with the law,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cEnforcement isn\u2019t only up to the executive branch.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in a message posted on X, listed a number of state and federal agencies, and private entities, that might be willing to go to court to get the ban enforced.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d Cotton noted.",
      "Despite the intense scrutiny and potential costs involved, the machinations over TikTok are in some ways just business as usual for the tech companies involved, according to Gus Hurwitz, a legal scholar with the International Center for Law and Economics.",
      "\u201cThe fines that we\u2019re talking about are civil penalties and companies risk civil penalties all the time,\u201d Hurwitz said.",
      "Still, the hard business calculus of complying with a law in limbo or risk defying a president who holds lucrative federal contracts over those companies could come into focus if shareholders sue.",
      "Oracle, for example, has a part of the Pentagon\u2019s $9 billion contract to build its cloud computing network.",
      "\u201cThis actually could be the right business decision to make,\u201d Hurwitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a breach of duty to shareholders.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been lots of questions about how companies such as Oracle and Akamai Technologies are powering TikTok\u2019s servers to stay online, while others such as Apple and Google have made the app unavailable for new users to download.",
      "None of the companies have responded to requests for comment.",
      "Oracle in 2020 announced it had a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global after securing its business as the app\u2019s cloud technology provider.",
      "Meanwhile, as of Monday night, a search for TikTok on Apple\u2019s app store directs to an online statement that reads in part: \u201cApple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,\u201d while Google\u2019s app store notes downloads for TikTok \u201care paused due to current US legal requirements.\u201d",

      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility.\u201d It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",

      "Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",
      "Many \u201care likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that\u2019s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs.",
      "In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it.",
      "Michigan's state investment board reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases, while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto.",
      "Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund.",
      "\u201cWe were ahead of the curve,\" Fulop said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.\u201d",

      "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security",
      "NEW YORK -- During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed a threat to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app's savior.",
      "After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he's sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban \u201cso that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\u201d He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok's sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users.",
      "\u201cThanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!\" read the announcement.",
      "Trump's legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April and was upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",
      "Trump can now take credit for reviving an app with 170 million users that is especially popular with younger Americans, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform to get news, make money and find entertainment.",
      "\u201cThis is one of those things where the domestic politics has become so upside down and crazy that it turns out there\u2019s only upside for Trump now,\u201d said Bill Bishop, a China expert who has been closely following the back-and-forth. If the bans ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s watch. \u201cAnd if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users\u201d as well as the company, which he said is now \u201cbeholden to Trump\u201d and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him.",
      "TikTok\u2019s move comes as tech companies and CEOs have been been working furiously to improve their standing with Trump. X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms\u2019 policies to align more closely with Trump\u2019s worldview earlier this month, ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company\u2019s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a familiar figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, to its board.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon, Meta and Google have all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "The companies have a lot on the line, including regulatory challenges. Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "TikTok also worked to curry Trump's favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December. In a video responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app's fate as dependent on him.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.\"",
      "When the app went dark, it had initially posted a simple message informing users of the change, but later updated the language to include Trump.",
      "\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d it read. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d",
      "The federal law had required TikTok parent company ByteDance to cut ties with the platform\u2019s U.S. operations by Sunday. The Biden administration had stressed in recent days that it did not intend to enforce the ban before Trump took office. But TikTok said it would nonetheless \u201cgo dark\u201d because the Biden administration had not provided \u201cnecessary clarity and assurance\u201d to service providers \u2014 a stance outgoing Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer cast as disingenuous.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t feel completely on the level,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cI think we were extremely clear that there was no need to take this action,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Saturday that he was considering granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell. ByteDance has repeatedly refused to sell, but the company is being eyed by investors including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said there was no evidence ByteDance had made any meaningful progress toward divestiture, \u201cso I don\u2019t see how, by any measure, it would legally meet those conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,\u201d she said. \"Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have \u201ca 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d that would be \"set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move.",
      "\u201cAs of today, TikTok is back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have to save it.\u201d",
      "Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app's rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden.",
      "Trump ended up joining the app last year and has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters.",
      "\u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d he said during a December news conference. \u201cTikTok had an impact.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Nothing doctors prescribed controlled Michael Garrity\u2019s dangerously high blood pressure \u2014 until they zapped away some nerves on his kidneys.",
      "If that sounds weird, well, kidneys help regulate blood pressure in part through signals from certain nerves. The new treatment disrupts overactive renal nerves.",
      "\u201cMy blood pressure would spike and I\u2019d run out of breath and feel tired, and that doesn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d said Garrity, 62, of Needham, Massachusetts. He still takes medicine but at lower doses, his blood pressure normal for the first time in years. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, a major risk for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, even dementia. Many people don\u2019t even realize they have hypertension until it\u2019s done serious damage.",
      "\u201cKnow your blood pressure, know the numbers,\u201d stressed Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who specializes in the hardest-to-treat cases and advises people who think they\u2019re fine to at least get a yearly check.",
      "And only a fraction of patients have their hypertension well-controlled, meaning there\u2019s a need for novel strategies. The Food and Drug Administration approved that \u201crenal denervation\u201d option about a year ago, based on studies showing a modest benefit in patients whose blood pressure remains high despite multiple medicines.",
      "Now, after the American Heart Association recently deemed it promising, some hospitals including Mass General Brigham are cautiously offering it as they work out who are good candidates \u2014 and whether their insurance will cover a minimally invasive procedure costing thousands of dollars.",
      "Two numbers describe blood pressure. The top, \u201csystolic\u201d pressure, is the force blood puts on the walls of arteries as its pumped out of the heart. The bottom \u201cdiastolic\u201d number measures that same pressure but between heartbeats.",
      "Normal is less than 120 over 80. Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, higher when you\u2019re physically active or stressed. But when it stays high \u2014 consistently 130 over 80 or higher, according to the most recent guidelines \u2014 it stiffens arteries and makes the heart work harder.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take a doctor\u2019s visit. Pharmacies and sometimes even libraries offer screening, and people can use at-home monitors.",
      "To avoid falsely high readings, the American Medical Association has tips: Sit quietly with feet on the floor, legs not crossed. Place the cuff on a bare arm, not over clothing. Don\u2019t dangle the arm \u2014 rest it on a table.",
      "Lifestyle changes are the first step, especially for otherwise healthy people. Guidelines urge losing weight, exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to handle stress.",
      "Medicine is a must once hypertension reaches 140 over 90. The average patient requires two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living, Zusman said.",
      "But the hypertension Garrity has struggled with since his late 20s is treatment-resistant. Despite taking four to six drugs plus a strict diet and exercise, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or worse.",
      "Doctors thread a small catheter, or tube, through blood vessels to reach the kidneys, and then beam in ultrasound or radiofrequency energy. Those pulses pass through the renal arteries to selectively target surrounding nerves, said Dr. Joseph Garasic, a Mass General interventional cardiologist who performed Garrity\u2019s procedure. It takes about an hour.",
      "Although already used in other countries, a key U.S. trial of renal denervation failed about a decade ago, prompting changes before researchers tried again. In November 2023, the FDA approved two catheter systems, from Recor Medical and Medtronic.",
      "It\u2019s not a cure \u2013 and some patients get no benefit. But Garasic said multiple studies show on average an 8 to 10-point drop in blood pressure, a modest but important improvement. Some like Garrity see a bigger drop, enough to gradually scale back medications.",
      "The FDA deemed the procedure safe for carefully chosen patients \u2014 it wasn\u2019t tested in those with kidney disease or narrowed arteries, for example. And studies have lasted only a few years, not long enough to tell if the nerves might eventually regenerate.",

      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles versus those still standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world",
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\u201cIt's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\u201d Balcazar said. \u201cTo me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\u201d",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\u201cBecause there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \u201cIf you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that\u2019s not luck, that\u2019s increasing your odds.\u201d",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

      "The company and the once-prominent family behind the drug OxyContin agreed Thursday to increase their financial contribution to resolve mass opioid litigation.",
      "The Sacklers and Purdue Pharma boosted their settlement contribution to $7.4 billion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a prior settlement in June 2024. If approved, the new plan would end the costliest corporate bankruptcy resulting from the U.S. opioid crisis.",

      "The pharmaceutical company introduced OxyContin, a brand name of oxycodone, in the 1990s and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 after the company was sued thousands of times.",
      "Under the settlement terms, the Sacklers' control of Purdue Pharma ends. The $7.4 billion will go directly to communities across the U.S. -- including states, counties, cities and territories -- over the next 15 years to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs.",

      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office helped negotiate the settlement agreement.",
      "\"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients, and played a critical role in starting and fueling in the opioid epidemic,\" she continued. \"While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",

      "The Department of Justice, under new leadership following the inauguration of Donald Trump, has told legal service providers who receive federal funding to stop providing legal orientation and other work intended to support immigrants at immigration courts.",

      "\"This email is to send you notification to stop work immediately pursuant to the Executive Order on the following task orders,\" the memo said. The programs listed in the memo include the Legal Orientation Program; the Immigration Court Helpdesk; the Family Group Legal Orientation Program; and the Counsel for Children Initiative.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 14:14:01 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump issued an executive order declaring that the U.S. government would only recognize a person\u2019s sex assigned at birth.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump issued an executive order limiting gender definitions on Monday.",
      "On his first day back in office on Monday, President Trump issued an executive order declaring that the U.S. government would only recognize a person's sex assigned at birth, limit the definition of a \"male\" or \"female\" to their reproductive cells and potentially withhold federal funding from programs that acknowledge transgender people or \"gender ideology.\"",
      "Medical and legal experts say the executive order rejects the reality of sexual and gender diversity, and are concerned about the implications it will have for intersex, nonbinary and transgender Americans.",
      "Anti-transgender themes were central to the Trump campaign. In the months leading up to the 2024 election, the campaign and Republican groups spent millions on anti-trans television ads. Trump also promised to restrict access to gender-affirming care and transgender participation in sports.",
      "Trump's executive order declares sex as \"an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female\" and states that \"gender identity\" cannot be included in the definition of \"sex,\" and that \"sex\" and \"gender\" cannot be used interchangeably.",
      "The executive order declares there are only \"two sexes, male and female\" and defines a \"female\" as \"a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.\" The order defines \"male\" as \"a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.\"",
      "\"This one is shockingly out of step with what we know from science,\" Kellan E. Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research & Policy at health services network Whitman-Walker, told ABC News in an interview.",
      "Baker noted that we're accustomed to thinking of sex \"as a fairly simple, binary, immutable thing,\" but said science tells us it's not that simple.",
      "\"Sex is not a singular, binary, immutable trait,\" he said. \"It is, in fact, a complex cluster of multiple traits, some of which align with each other and sometimes some of which do not align with each other.\"",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines sex as \"an individual's biological status as male, female, or something else. Sex is assigned at birth and associated with physical attributes, such as anatomy and chromosomes.\"",
      "Intersex populations are not noted in the executive order. Intersex people are those with variations in their sex traits such as genitals, chromosomes, hormones or reproductive organs, and differ from expectations of male and female anatomy.",
      "The term intersex may also be categorized as \"differences of sex development.\" Not all conditions are noticeable at birth, according to MedlinePlus, a resource from the National Library of Medicine and therefore, may not be known until later in life.",
      "\"There are multiple different sex traits that make up this concept that we think of as sex,\" Baker said. \"They include, for example, chromosomes. They also include external genitalia, gonads, hormones.\"",
      "Baker also notes that sexual differentiation via reproductive cells doesn't take place until about six weeks after conception, contrary to the definition stated by the executive order.",
      "The order states that the definitions of sex are a response to \"efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex.\"",
      "\"Invalidating the true and biological category of 'woman' improperly transforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept,\" the order reads.",
      "Jenny Pizer, chief legal officer at LGBTQ civil rights group Lambda Legal, told ABC News her organization is preparing for legal action against the executive order. She argues the order could force agencies to no longer recognize transgender or intersex people by restricting funding that promote \"gender ideology.\"",
      "The order states that gender ideology \"is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.\"",
      "It goes further to state, \"Agency forms that require an individual's sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity.\"",
      "\"The current structure of our society is that there is federal funding throughout many of our essential systems, and so we don't know, but it is certainly possible that the Trump administration is going to attempt to exclude or mistreat members of our community in many, many of these settings,\" Pizer said.",
      "The executive order also revokes a 2022 Biden administration rule in which the U.S. Department of State made it possible for people applying for American passports to select \"X\" to mark their gender.",
      "The rule announced by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken marked the Transgender Day of Visibility and was designed to accommodate nonbinary, intersex and gender-nonconforming individuals.",
      "Lambda Legal was behind the effort to implement an \"X\" gender marker for passports. Their client at the time, Dana Zzyym, had been denied a passport because they were intersex and could not accurately pick between male or female on the application form, according to the organization.",
      "\"We'll continue to stand with Dana and all intersex, nonbinary, and transgender people to defend their right to identity documents that accurately identify who they are, and their equal protection rights against targeting and exclusion by their own government,\" it said in a statement posted to its website on Monday.",
      "Trump also implemented policies or took positions that adversely affected the LGBTQ community in his first term. He banned some transgender people from serving in the military, repealed Obama-era non-discrimination health care policy and advocated against employment protection for LGBTQ workers before the Supreme Court.",

      "Efforts by the U.S. Forest Service to fight wildfires in California shouldn't be influenced by politics, President Donald Trump's nominee to head the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday at her Senate confirmation hearing.",
      "Responding to questions from a Senate panel, nominee Brooke Rollins also acknowledged that Trump's plans for mass deportations and tariffs could create hardships for the agriculture industry, but she said his election demonstrated that the public supports such actions.",
      "Trump nominated Rollins, who also served in his first administration, to lead a sprawling agency that oversees farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition. If confirmed as agriculture secretary, Rollins would take charge of the agency at a time when many farmers have seen their profits plunge and when the Forest Service is joining efforts to fight a wave of wildfires in Southern California.",
      "Given that Trump has threatened to withhold federal disaster aid from Los Angeles unless California officials change how the state manages its water resources, California Sen. Adam Schiff asked Rollins if she would commit to equal treatment from the Forest Service.",
      "\u201cAre you committed to employing the same emergency resources to fight wildfires in blue states as would be deployed to fight wildfires in red states?\u201d Schiff asked.",
      "Rollins responded that she would not support discrimination against any state.",
      "\u201cObviously, but it bears saying since you asked, 100% yes,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cTo watch the devastation in your beautiful state has been heartbreaking for all of us, no matter if we\u2019re from red states or blue states.\u201d",
      "Rollins, 52, is a lawyer from Texas who served as domestic policy chief during Trump's first term and is now the president and CEO of the American First Policy Institute, which has helped map out plans for the second Trump administration. She graduated from Texas A&M with an undergraduate degree in agricultural development and then earned her law degree at the University of Texas.",
      "Schiff and other Democrats on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee also asked Rollins about Trump's plans for mass deportations of people in the country illegally. They noted that a high percentage of those who harvest produce and work at dairies could be abruptly deported, causing a giant labor shortage.",
      "Rollins said she supported Trump\u2019s agenda but acknowledged it could be difficult for U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s vision of a secure border and a mass deportation at a scale that matters is something I support,\u201d Rollins said.",

      "\u201cThat is my commitment, is to help President Trump deploy his agenda in an effective way while at the same time defending, if confirmed as secretary of agriculture, our farmers and ranchers across this country,\" she said.",

      "Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, said farmers and ranchers see little prospect for improving their economic condition other than expanding exports. Bennet implored Rollins to make the case to Trump that higher tariffs would devastate efforts to increase exports.",
      "Rollins said she would always speak up for the needs of farmers and ranchers.",
      "\u201cMy role is to defend, to honor, to elevate our entire agriculture community in the Oval Office around the table, through the interagency process and to ensure that every decision that is made in the coming four years has that front of mind as those decisions are being made,\u201d Rollins said.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will depart on his first foreign trip next week to visit countries in Central America and the Caribbean whose cooperation may be vital for carrying out the Trump administration's mass deportation plans, the State Department said on Thursday.",
      "Rubio is expected to journey to Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic, according to the department.",
      "The Trump administration's immigration crackdown is expected to be a major part of Rubio's agenda during the diplomatic mission. In a statement from the Pentagon released on Wednesday announcing that active-duty troops would be deployed to the southern border, acting Defense Secretary Robert Salesses said the State Department will be in charge of obtaining \"the requisite diplomatic clearances and provide host-nation notification\" for deportation flights.",
      "To accomplish that, Rubio is expected to encourage foreign governments to accept more of their deported nationals and, in some cases, take in deportees from other countries.",
      "Rubio has already said addressing irregular immigration will be a central focus of the State Department during the second Trump administration. In a statement issued Wednesday, Rubio said, \"Our diplomatic relations with other countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America's borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants.\"",
      "He also said the department will \"no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage mass migration.\"",
      "In Panama, Rubio's engagements are likely to focus on the country's strategic waterway: the Panama Canal. President Donald Trump has voiced concerns about the canal's operations numerous times in recent weeks, claiming during his inaugural address that the Panamanian government has broken promises it made to maintain the waterway's neutrality when the United States agreed to turn over control of the canal in 1977.",
      "\"The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way,\" Trump said. \"And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly said the U.S. should take back control of the canal, refusing to rule out using the U.S. military to do so.",
      "While China does not actually operate the canal, Chinese-owned companies do operate the canals on either side of the waterway, and Beijing's strategic positioning has stoked bipartisan concern in the past.",
      "\"A foreign power today possesses, through their companies, which we know are not independent, the ability to turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict, and that is a direct threat to the national interest and security of the United States,\" Rubio said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate earlier this month.",
      "\"This is a legitimate issue that needs to be confronted,\" Rubio said, adding that he wasn't yet prepared to say whether Beijing has the ability to take effective control of the waterway.",
      "\"It's something we're going to have to study very carefully,\" he said. \"This is not a joke. The Panama Canal issue is a very serious one.\"",
      "Rubio has also voiced concerns about lax oversight allowing smuggled goods to be moved through the canal, and in 2022, he led a bipartisan group of senators in urging the government of Panama to investigate tankers accused of smuggling Iranian oil through the canal.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Rubio also shared a positive review of Panamanian leaders.",
      "\"The Panamanian government, particularly its current officeholders, are very friendly to the United States and very cooperative,\" he said. \"And we want that to continue.\"",

      "Asked whether the Jan. 6 defendants who were charged with assaulting police officers deserved a pardon, he said yes.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 11:48:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Newly installed DOJ officials on Wednesday tried to ease concerns within the National Security Division after two of their top prosecutors were removed, sources said.",
    "story": [
      "Two prosecutors were told to accept reassignment or leave the DOJ, sources said.",
      "Newly installed Justice Department officials on Wednesday tried to ease concerns within the department's National Security Division after two of the division's most experienced prosecutors were removed by the new Trump administration, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Sources said the move rattled some prosecutors, who are worried about what could come next for the branch that handles some of the nation's most sensitive matters, including cases tied to global terrorism, domestic extremism, foreign espionage and influence operations, sanctions violations, and leaks of classified information.",
      "According to one source, however, no more personnel changes within the division are imminently planned.",
      "On a division-wide conference call Wednesday morning, the acting head of the National Security Division, Devin DeBacker, praised the two prosecutors who had been removed, thanked them for their service, and gave each of them a chance to say farewell to colleagues, a source familiar with the call said.",
      "One of the prosecutors, George Toscas -- who has been serving in the National Security Division since its inception under the George W. Bush administration -- had been told a day or two earlier that he had two weeks to either report to a new immigration-related task force focused on addressing \"sanctuary cities,\" or leave the Justice Department, sources told ABC News. The other prosecutor, Eun Young Choi -- who has been with the Justice Department for more than a decade -- was given a similar instruction, according to the sources.",
      "As one source recounted to ABC News, both Toscas and Choi grew emotional during Wednesday's call, with Toscas talking about how honored he was to serve the National Security Division and how committed he was to its mission.",
      "The two prosecutors, who both served as deputy assistant attorneys general during the Biden administration, were among a slew of career Justice Department officials removed from their posts, including officials in the department's Criminal Division and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the nation's immigration courts, current and former Justice Department officials said.",
      "One current official told ABC News that the Justice Department's \"brain trust\" of career officials was being banished apparently in favor of those loyal to Trump. Trump has for years accused the Justice Department of unfairly targeting him, saying in his inaugural address on Monday that his new administration will end \"the vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department.\"",
      "Former Attorney General Merrick Garland and other senior Justice Department officials have consistently denied such claims, insisting their investigations were fair and fact-based.",
      "It's unclear exactly what drove the Trump administration to identify Toscas, Choi and the other officials for removal. However, Toscas held senior roles within the National Security Division while the Justice Department opened many of the investigations that have for years incensed Trump and his allies, including the initial investigation into alleged ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and the more recent investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents after leaving office in 2021.",
      "The Washington Post previously reported that, as part of the classified documents investigation, Toscas had supported the FBI's search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022.",
      "At the same time, while Toscas was among its leadership, the National Security Division helped investigate and file charges against a wide array of alleged foreign spies, terrorists and other criminals, including an Iranian man who was allegedly looking to assassinate Trump.",
      "Toscas has now been assigned to the Justice Department's newly-created \"Office of Sanctuary Cities Enforcement,\" which a memo from the new acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, said would seek to identify any local laws and activities \"that are inconsistent with\" the Trump administration's immigration initiatives, and then \"take legal action\" when appropriate.",
      "It's unclear if Toscas or Choi plan to accept their new assignments. Efforts by ABC News to reach them were unsuccessful.",
      "DeBacker became the acting head of the National Security Division after Trump took office. He served in Trump's first White House and spent the last months of the administration at the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He joined the National Security Division in early 2022, under the Biden administration, overseeing efforts to review foreign investments, according to his LinkedIn page.",
      "Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who represented Trump during his first impeachment, is awaiting Senate confirmation to become the next U.S. attorney general. Nominees for some of the other top positions in the Justice Department, including the head of the National Security Division, have yet to be named.",

      "A proposal introduced in the New York Legislature could make it a crime for people to wear face masks to harass or threaten someone",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A proposal introduced in the New York Legislature on Thursday could make it a crime for people to wear face masks to harass or threaten someone.",
      "The bill would create the crime of \u201cmasked harassment\u201d under the state's existing harassment laws and contains several exemptions for people who wear masks for medical reasons or during cold weather, among other carve outs.",
      "State Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, said his intention is to create a law that will allow law enforcement to go after people who wear masks to intimidate or threaten others, rather than trying to establish a widespread ban on face coverings.",
      "His bill would make it a misdemeanor for a person to wear a mask \u201cfor the primary purpose of menacing or threatening violence against another person or placing another person or group of persons in reasonable fear for their physical safety.\u201d",
      "Skoufis said he does not want the proposal to be used to target peaceful protesters, who in many cases wear masks or other face coverings to hide their identities to avoid legal, personal or professional repercussions.",
      "But Allie Bohm, a senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the proposal's language is too vague and could result in selective enforcement against people expressing free speech rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get into a a lot of he-said-she-said trying to intuit people\u2019s intentions,\u201d Bohm said. \u201cPeople do have a right to protest, and that\u2019s true whether or not we agree with their messages.\u201d",
      "It is not clear how the bill will fare in the state Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats. The offices of the Democratic leaders of the Senate and Assembly did not immediately return emails seeking comment on the proposal.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, last year floated a potential mask ban on the New York City subways over concerns that people were shielding their identities while committing antisemitic acts. At the time, the idea drew strong pushback from civil liberties groups and from others who pointed out that masks are common on the subways because of concerns about poor air quality and COVID-19.",
      "Hochul said this month that she was still open to considering legislation \u201cthat says if you commit a crime while wearing a mask, there should be enhanced penalties.\u201d",
      "New York had a law that banned face masks in public that was passed in the 1800s in response to anti-rent protests, and resulted in criticism that it was selectively enforced during various protests since it was enacted. That law was suspended during the coronavirus pandemic when face masks were mandated in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.",
      "A conservative suburban county on Long Island last year passed a law banning face masks in public in response to what were called antisemitic incidents since the Oct. 7 start of the Israel-Hamas war, with exceptions for medical or religious purposes. A pro-Palestinian protester wearing a keffiyeh scarf was charged with violating the law shortly after it was passed.",
      "There have been hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrations in New York after the war between Hamas and Israel began in October. The demonstrations have overwhelmingly been peaceful, though mask-wearing is very common among participants who are wary of police surveillance or other repercussions."

      "Responding to questions from a Senate panel, nominee Brooke Rollins also acknowledged that Trump's plans for mass deportations and tariffs could create hardships for the agriculture industry, but she said his election demonstrated that the public supports such actions.",
      "Trump nominated Rollins, who also served in his first administration, to lead a sprawling agency that oversees farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition. If confirmed as agriculture secretary, Rollins would take charge of the agency at a time when many farmers have seen their profits plunge and when the Forest Service is joining efforts to fight a wave of wildfires in Southern California.",

      "Schiff and other Democrats on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee also asked Rollins about Trump's plans for mass deportations of people in the country illegally.

      "The ruling stems from a 2018 case in which a high school teacher in Albuquerque was accused of cutting off one Native American girl\u2019s hair and asking another if she was dressed as a \u201cbloody Indian\u201d during class on Halloween. That 16-year-old Navajo student was in a costume and had fake blood on her cheek.",

      "The ruling affirmed a 2023 decision by an appellate court and concluded that public schools are a place of \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d under terms of the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law. The court wrote that public schools do not restrict their services in a way that makes their use private, and it noted that the state constitution mandates that public schools in New Mexico be open to all children.",
      "The justices also overturned a 1981 opinion stating public universities were not a public accommodation when it came to the \u201cmanner and method\u201d of administering academic programs. The question about universities was raised in the appeal.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- President Warren G. Harding drove a golden spike into the final coupling of the Alaska Railroad more than a century ago, a ceremonial act that marked the launch of a system to easily bring coal and other natural resources out of the wilderness.",
      "Harding would die of a massive heart attack just a few days later, on his way back to Washington, D.C. The spike he pounded with such fanfare \u2014 weighing nearly a pound and valued at up to $50,000 \u2014 has been in private hands outside of the state ever since.",
      "Now, two Alaska institutions want to bring that piece of history home. The Anchorage Museum, with financial backing from the Alaska Railroad, will bid on the 14-karat solid gold spike when it goes up for auction Friday in New York as part of the Christie's Important Americana collection, said Aaron Leggett, the museum\u2019s senior curator of Alaska history and Indigenous cultures.",
      "\u201cThe whole history of our state and really the whole history of this town begins with the Alaska Railroad,\u201d Leggett said of Alaska and its biggest city, Anchorage.",
      "The 5 1/2-inch (14-centimeter) spike is being offered by an unidentified California resident who has owned it since 1983. The Alaska Railroad, originally constructed, owned and operated by the federal government, was sold to the state for $22 million in 1985.",
      "The railroad was built to open what was then the Alaska territory to development. It connected Seward, a Pacific Ocean port city on the south-central coast, to Fairbanks, 470 miles (756 kilometers) away in interior Alaska.",
      "The construction project lasted from 1914 to 1923. Laying tracks across the untamed Alaska wilderness had a \u201ctransformational impact on the last century of Alaska's history,\u201d said Meghan Clemens, the railroad\u2019s director of external affairs. Alaska would not become a state until 1959.",
      "Even today, there are few highways in the nation\u2019s largest state; one of the busiest is along the same passenger and freight rail corridor from Seward to Fairbanks. About 75% of Alaska\u2019s 740,000 residents also live along that stretch, called the rail belt, which Clemens said is a testament to how instrumental the railroad has been to the economic development and growth of Alaska.",
      "\u201cAnchorage, as we know it today, would not exist were it not for the fact that the Alaska Railroad selected Anchorage as the headquarters,\u201d Leggett said. The logical choice would have been Seward, but the government instead chose a muddy site along Ship Creek in what is now downtown Anchorage.",
      "U.S. Army Col. Frederick Mears worked as an engineer on the construction of the Panama Canal. His work there caught the eye of President Woodrow Wilson, who had plans for a new railroad for the Alaska territory. In his 1913 State of the Union address, Wilson touted the railroad as key to providing access to Alaska's coal and other minerals.",
      "With the project nearly complete, the Army sent Mears to Seattle in March 1923, four months before Harding's visit. Before Mears left, the city of Anchorage presented him with the golden spike in appreciation of his work. He sent the spike back from Seattle for the Harding event in Nenana, a community in interior Alaska. Harding was the first president to visit Alaska.",
      "During the ceremonial launch of the railroad on July 15, 1923, Harding lightly tapped the golden spike twice with a maul, a hammer now behind glass at the railroad headquarters, before driving a regular spike. Shortly after, the golden spike was returned to Mears, and Harding began the long trip back to Washington. He suffered a fatal heart attack and died in San Francisco on Aug. 2, 1923.",
      "Since then, the spike has remained out of the public eye, except for a brief display during the 1967 centennial of the U.S. purchase of Alaska from Russia.",
      "It's in perfect condition, and shows little evidence of where it was tapped, said Christopher June, a junior specialist at Christie\u2019s who grew up in Anchorage and remembers field trips on the Alaska Railroad as a child.",
      "\u201cI think it definitely has a lot of interest and importance to the state,\" June said. \"I would not be surprised at all if the eventual buyer was Alaskan.\u201d",

      "A three-judge panel in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard arguments about a new Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms",
      "As Louisiana public schools remain in limbo over a new law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms \u2014 caught between the state releasing guidelines for districts to comply with the mandate that took effect this year and opponents threatening to sue if any such posters are hung up \u2014 a three-judge panel heard arguments about the controversial legislation Thursday morning.",
      "In the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, the state is appealing an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to take steps to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.",
      "The state contends that deGravelles\u2019 order only affects the five school districts that are defendants in a legal challenge. But it\u2019s unclear whether or how the law would be enforced in the state\u2019s 67 other districts while the appeal progresses.",
      "\u201cI know this needs to be addressed sooner rather than later, and we will do our best to do so,\u201d Judge Catharina Haynes said as arguments concluded Thursday. Haynes did not specify when a ruling would be issued.",
      "The law, which applies to all public K-12 school and state-funded university classrooms, took effect Jan. 1. Days after the mandate went into effect, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill \u2014 the state's top lawyer \u2014 made clear that she expects school districts to comply.",
      "Murrill issued guidance to schools on how to do so, including four samples of the Ten Commandments posters. In addition, each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph \u201ccontext statement\u201d describing how the Ten Commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\u201d",
      "Over the past month, the Associated Press has reached out to dozens of school districts, the Attorney General's office and the Department of Education and has not been told of any schools that have begun to hang up such posters.",
      "Opponents of the law argue that it is a violation of the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian.",
      "Plaintiffs in the suit include parents of Louisiana public school children with various religious backgrounds, who are represented by attorneys with civil liberties groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation.",
      "Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. Additionally, Murrill argues that the lawsuit is premature as posters have yet to be hung up.",
      "The new law in Louisiana, a reliably Republican state that is ensconced in the Bible Belt, was passed by the state\u2019s GOP-dominated Legislature earlier this year. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the legislation in June \u2014 making Louisiana the only state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in the classrooms of all public schools and state-funded universities. The measure was part of a slew of conservative priorities that became law in Louisiana last year.",
      "The legislation, which has been touted by Republicans including President Donald Trump, is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms \u2014 from Florida legislation allowing school districts to have volunteer chaplains to counsel students to Oklahoma\u2019s top education official ordering public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons.",
      "In recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, none have gone into effect.",
      "In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose."

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will make his first official trip abroad next week to Central America",
      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio will make his first official trip abroad next week to Central America, including a stop in Panama, which President Donald Trump has riled with talk of trying to reclaim the Panama Canal.",
      "Rubio, a former Florida senator who is the son of Cuban immigrants, will also visit El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic, department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said Thursday.",
      "She said the destinations reflected his interest in the region and the importance of elevating ties with neighboring countries, particularly on combating illegal migration.",
      "\u201cThis is a serious approach by the secretary to deal with the issues that directly affect our ability to get this nation back on her feet and to deal with why there is such high migration,\" Bruce said.",
      "She said the trip \u201csignals something to those countries, it should signal something to Americans and to those who also said that \u2018America First\u2019 was an isolationist argument. It is the opposite.\u201d",
      "While migration will be at the top of Rubio's agenda, the stop in Panama probably will draw the most attention because of Trump's repeated calls for the United States to retake control of the Panama Canal. Trump has accused Panama of reneging on commitments for the operation of the canal made to then-President Jimmy Carter when the U.S. ceded control of the vital waterway.",
      "Trump has often complained that China has take over canal operations, charges denied by Panamanian officials.",
      "Rubio is expected to depart late next week and return to Washington toward the end of the first week in February."

      "As promised, President Donald Trump began reversing the country\u2019s energy policies on his first day in office with a spate of orders largely favoring oil, gas and coal",
      "As promised, President Donald Trump began reversing the country's energy policies his first day in office with a spate of orders largely favoring oil, gas and coal. But there is one renewable energy that did find favor: geothermal.",
      "Energy experts say that makes sense \u2014 geothermal energy makes electricity 24/7. Many people working in the field came from the oil and gas industry and they use much of the same technology for drilling wells. Trump strongly supports and gets support from the oil and gas industry. And there's bipartisan support in Congress for geothermal.",
      "\u201cThe embrace of advanced geothermal under this new administration, I\u2019d say is not a giant surprise,\u201d said Alex Kania, a managing director at Marathon Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s reliable, it\u2019s efficient, and frankly their ties to the more conventional forms of energy production, I think, is probably not lost on some people.\"",
      "Geothermal creates electricity cleanly by making steam from the Earth\u2019s natural heat and using that steam to spin a turbine. It's a climate solution because it reduces the need for traditional power plants that burn fossil fuels and cause climate change.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency on Monday, and included geothermal heat as one of the domestic energy resources that could help ensure a reliable, diversified and affordable supply of energy. Solar, wind and battery storage were omitted, and wind was singled out in a separate order with measures intended to slow it down.",
      "\u201cGeothermal is heating up and the Trump administration is going to empower the industry over the next four years to achieve its potential,\u201d said Bryant Jones, executive director of the geothermal trade association, Geothermal Rising.",
      "It's a vibrant business right now.",
      "New geothermal companies are adapting technology and practices from oil and gas to create steam from ubiquitous hot rock. That would make this kind of electricity possible in many more places. The Energy Department estimates the next generation of geothermal projects could provide some 90 gigawatts in the U.S. by 2050 \u2014 enough to power 65 million homes or more. Former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm supported geothermal as a climate solution.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary, Chris Wright, is a fossil fuel executive who values geothermal, too. His company, Denver-based Liberty Energy, invested in Fervo Energy, a Houston-based geothermal company. Wright said at his confirmation hearing that he\u2019s excited about geothermal as an \u201can enormous, abundant energy resource below everyone\u2019s feet.\u201d",
      "Wright\u2019s appointment is a clear signal that this administration will support geothermal, said Terra Rogers, a program director who focuses on the technology at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s well-informed of its risks and opportunities, and continues to be a strong advocate for what it could be,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "The United States is a world leader in electricity made from geothermal energy, but it still accounts for less than half a percent of the nation\u2019s total large-scale generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The big states are California, Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, Oregon, Idaho and New Mexico, where reservoirs of steam, or very hot water, lie close to the surface.",
      "In its first actions this week, the new administration also indicated support for nuclear power and removing obstacles to mining uranium, which can be refined into nuclear fuel. Like geothermal, nuclear power does not cause climate change. The executive order also backs hydropower.",
      "Solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the United States.",
      "Trump wants to increase production of oil and gas in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says. He took aim at wind energy, temporarily halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and pausing federal approvals, permits and loans for projects both onshore and offshore.",
      "Trump says wind turbines are horrible, only work with subsidies and are \u201cmany, many times\u201d more expensive than natural gas. Offshore wind is one of the most expensive sources of new power generation, but onshore wind is cheaper than new natural gas plants, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration.",
      "Jones, at Geothermal Rising, said the industry hopes the support for geothermal energy will lead to streamlined permitting, more federal research and tax credits to promote innovation.",
      "Sage Geosystems in Houston is a geothermal company launched by former executives at oil and gas giant Shell. CEO Cindy Taff said it's exciting to see more momentum building for geothermal. She hopes it will spur investment in large projects, including those that meet surging demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence, and projects to make military facilities energy resilient.",
      "If geothermal projects could multiply fast across the country, she said, it would bring the cost down, and that would be good for everyone.",
      "\u201cThis could be the decade of geothermal,\u201d Taff said.",

He likes these methods,\u201d Peskov said.",
      "Peskov added that Moscow \u201cremains ready for an equal dialogue, for a mutually respectful dialogue.\u201d",

      "Several Republicans who narrowly won California House seats in November have expressed dismay that the state relief could be hitched to demands in exchange for helping the thousands of Californians in their districts still reeling from this month\u2019s disaster.",

      "The House on Wednesday gave final approval to a bill that requires the detainment of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes, marking the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Passage of the Laken Riley Act, which was named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man, shows just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump\u2019s election victory. Immigration policy has often been one of the most entrenched issues in Congress, but a crucial faction of 46 politically vulnerable Democrats joined with Republicans to lift the strict proposal to passage on a 263-156 vote tally.",

      "Firefighters are battling to maintain the upper hand on a huge and rapidly-moving wildfire that swept through rugged mountains north of Los Angeles",
      "CASTAIC, Calif. -- Firefighters fought to maintain the upper hand on a huge and rapidly moving wildfire that swept through rugged mountains north of Los Angeles and resulted in more than 50,000 people being put under evacuation orders or warnings.",
      "The Hughes Fire broke out late Wednesday morning and in less than a day had charred nearly 16 square miles (41 square kilometers) of trees and brush near Castaic Lake, a popular recreation area about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the devastating Eaton and Palisades fires that are burning for a third week.",
      "Though the region was under a red flag warning for critical fire risk, winds were not as fast as they had been when those fires broke out, allowing for firefighting aircraft to dump tens of thousands of gallons of fire retardant on the latest blaze. By Wednesday night, about 14% of the Hughes Fire had been contained.",
      "\u201cThe situation that we\u2019re in today is very different from the situation we were in 16 days ago,\u201d Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday evening.",
      "Red flag warnings were extended through 10 a.m. Friday in LA and Ventura counties. Officials remained concerned that the Palisades and Eaton fires could break their containment lines as firefighters continue watching for hot spots.",
      "An evacuation warning was issued for Sherman Oaks after a brush fire broke out on the Sepulveda Pass near the I-405 Freeway. The blaze was first reported just after 11 p.m. Wednesday, but the Los Angeles Fire Department announced early Thursday that forward progress had been stopped at about 40 acres (16 hectares) and the evacuation warning was lifted. No structures were damaged and no injuries were reported, fire officials said, but firefighters remained at the scene.",
      "More than 31,000 people have been ordered to evacuate from the Hughes Fire, and another 23,000 are under evacuation warnings, LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said. There were no reports of homes or other structures burned.",
      "Parts of Interstate 5 near the Hughes Fire that had been closed reopened Wednesday evening.",
      "A 30-mile (48-kilometer) stretch of the major north-south artery had been closed for emergency vehicles, to move equipment and to prevent accidents due to smoke billowing across it. Crews on the ground and in water-dropping aircraft tried to prevent the wind-driven fire from moving across the interstate and toward Castaic.",
      "Marrone said that because winds were not as strong as they were two weeks ago, aircraft crews were able to drop fire retardant on the south side of the fire, where the flames were moving, he said. More than 4,000 firefighters were assigned to the fire, he said.",
      "Winds in the area were gusting at 42 mph (67 kph) in the afternoon. They had reached as high as 65 mph (105 KPH) in some mountain pockets by Wednesday night, according David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.",
      "Kayla Amara drove to Castaic's Stonegate neighborhood to collect items from the home of a friend who had rushed to pick up her daughter at preschool. As Amara was packing the car, she learned the fire had exploded in size and decided to hose down the property.",
      "\u201cOther people are hosing down their houses, too. I hope there's a house here to return to,\u201d Amara said as police cars raced through the streets and flames engulfed trees on a hillside in the distance.",
      "Amara, a nurse who lives in nearby Valencia, said she's been on edge for weeks as major blazes devastated Southern California.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been stressful with those other fires, but now that this one is close to home it's just super stressful,\u201d she said.",
      "To the south, Los Angeles officials began to prepare for potential rain even as some residents were allowed to return to the charred Pacific Palisades and Altadena areas. Gusty weather was expected to last through Thursday and precipitation was possible starting Saturday, according to the weather service.",
      "\u201cRains are in the forecast and the threat of mud and debris flow in our fire-impacted communities is real,\" Supervisor Kathryn Barger said during a Wednesday morning news conference.",
      "Fire crews were filling sandbags for communities while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass warned that winds could carry ash and advised Angelenos to visit the city's website to learn how to protect themselves from toxic air during the latest Santa Ana wind event. LA County public health director Barbara Ferrer cautioned that the ash could contain heavy metals, arsenic and other harmful materials.",
      "\u201cEven a brief exposure can potentially cause skin irritation and lead to more serious problems,\u201d Ferrer said Wednesday, asking people to wear protective gear while cleaning up.",
      "California Republicans are pushing back against suggestions by President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans that federal disaster aid for victims of wildfires should come with strings attached. Trump plans to visit the state to see the damage firsthand Friday, but it wasn't clear whether he and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom will meet during the visit.",
      "The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong winds came as firefighters continued battling the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out Jan. 7. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 70%, and the Eaton Fire was at 95%.",
      "Luna said Wednesday his department was still investigating 22 active missing person reports in both fire zones. All reported missing are adults, he said.",
      "The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the causes of the fires but has not released any findings.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A shooting in a Nashville high school cafeteria Wednesday left a female student dead and another student wounded, nearly two years after another deadly school shooting in the city that ignited an emotional debate about gun control in Tennessee.",
      "The 17-year-old shooter, who was also a student at Antioch High School, later shot and killed himself with a handgun, Metro Nashville Police spokesperson Don Aaron said during a news conference. Police identified him as Solomon Henderson.",
      "Police Chief John Drake said the shooter \u201cconfronted\u201d student Josselin Corea Escalante, 16, in the cafeteria and opened fire, killing her.",
      "The wounded student was grazed by a bullet. He was treated and released from the hospital, Drake said. Another student was taken to a hospital for treatment of a facial injury that happened during a fall, Aaron said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police, federal and state agencies are examining \u201cvery concerning online writings and social media posts connected to 17-year-old Solomon Henderson\u201d as they work to establish a motive, police said in a statement Wednesday evening.",
      "Investigators at this point have not established a connection between Henderson and the victims, and police said the gunfire may have been random, according to the statement.",
      "Two school resource officers were in the building when the shooting happened around 11 a.m., Aaron said. They were not in the immediate vicinity of the cafeteria and by the time they got down there the shooting was over and the gunman had killed himself, Aaron said.",
      "The school has about 2,000 students and is in Antioch, a neighborhood about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of downtown Nashville.",
      "At a family safety center close to a hospital, officials helped shocked parents reunite with their children.",
      "Dajuan Bernard was waiting at a Mapco service station to reunite with his son, a 10th grader, who was being held in the auditorium with other students Wednesday afternoon. He first heard of the shooting from his son, who \u201cwas a little startled,\u201d Bernard said. His son was upstairs from the cafeteria but said he heard the gunfire.",
      "\u201cHe was OK and let me know that everything was OK,\u201d Bernard said.",
      "\u201cThis world is so crazy, it could happen anywhere,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve just got to protect the kids, and raise the kids right to prevent them from even doing this. That\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d",
      "Fonda Abner said her granddaughter had called her a couple of times but that she only heard commotion and thought it was a pocket dial. They spoke briefly before being cut off.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nerve-racking waiting out here,\u201d Abner said.",
      "United Family Fellowship, a church in Antioch, was hosting a vigil Wednesday night \u201cfor anyone in the community who needs a space to pray, process, and find comfort,\u201d the church said on Facebook.",
      "Adrienne Battle, superintendent of Nashville schools, said earlier Wednesday that public schools have implemented a \u201crange of safety measures,\" including partnerships with police for school resource officers, security cameras with weapon-detection software, shatter-resistant film for glass, and security vestibules that are a barrier between outside visitors and the main entrance.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, these measures were not enough to stop this tragedy,\u201d Battle said.",
      "She said there are questions about whether stationary metal detectors should be considered.",
      "\u201cWhile past research has shown they have had limitations and unintended consequences, we will continue to explore emerging technologies and strategies to strengthen school safety,\u201d Battle said.",
      "In October, a 16-year-old Antioch High School student was arrested after school resource officers and school officials discovered through social media that he had taken a gun to school the day prior. When he was stopped the following morning, officials found a loaded gun in his pants, police said.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s school shooting comes nearly two years after a shooter opened fire at a separate Nashville private elementary school and killed six people, including three children.",
      "The tragedy prompted a monthslong effort among hundreds of community organizers, families, protesters and others pleading with lawmakers to consider passing gun control measures.",
      "GOP lawmakers in the Republican-dominant state refused to do so. With the Republican supermajority intact after November\u2019s election, it\u2019s unlikely attitudes have changed enough to consider any meaningful bills that would address gun control.",
      "Instead, lawmakers have been more open to adding more security to schools \u2014 including passing a bill last year that would allow some teachers and staff to carry concealed handguns on public school grounds, and bar parents and other teachers from knowing who was armed.",
      "Antioch, a growing and diverse area of Nashville, has endured other prominent shootings in recent years. A 2017 fatal shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ killed one woman and wounded seven people. And in 2018, a shooter killed four people at a Waffle House.",
      "State Rep. Shaundelle Brooks ran for office in large part due to her son\u2019s death in the Waffle House shooting and was elected last year after the Covenant shooting. She said the Antioch High shooting reinforces the need for gun control reforms. \u201cWe must do better,\u201d she said.",

      "Samantha Dickerson had taken her 14-year-old son\u2019s phone away as a punishment, so when she got a message from his school about the shooting, she had no way to reach him.",

      "After about three hours of waiting, she finally got a call from his English teacher and spoke with her son.",

      "A suburban Seattle police officer is set to be sentenced Thursday for the 2019 shooting death of a homeless man outside a convenience store",
      "A suburban Seattle police officer is set to be sentenced Thursday for the 2019 shooting death of a 26-year-old homeless man he was trying to arrest for disorderly conduct outside a convenience store.",
      "A King County jury found Auburn police Officer Jeffrey Nelson guilty on June 27 of second-degree murder and first-degree assault for fatally shooting Jesse Sarey, marking the first conviction under a Washington state law that made it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers for on-duty killings.",
      "Prosecutors plan to ask the judge to sentence Nelson at the top end of the standard range for each count: 18 years in prison for the murder charge and 10 years for the assault, and run them concurrently, according to their sentencing memorandum filed with the court.",
      "\u201cDoing so will reflect Nelson\u2019s long history of violence towards the less powerful, the egregious nature of his conduct, his dishonesty, and the great damage he has caused in our community,\u201d King County Special Prosecutor Patty Eakes said in the memo.",
      "Nelson's lawyers plan to urge the judge to sentence him to the lowest possible range - six and a half years \u2014 arguing he served his community, was a valued member of his team \u201cand on countless occasions, placed the lives of strangers above his own.\u201d",
      "\u201cOfficer Nelson chose a career in law enforcement because he was driven by his sense of duty to others,\" lawyer Kristen Murray said in their sentencing memo. \u201cHe wanted to serve his community and did so for years, working to help people every day. That's all gone now.\u201d",
      "During his trial in June, jurors were told that Nelson had responded to reports of a man throwing things at cars, kicking walls and banging on windows in a shopping area in Auburn, a city about 28 miles (45 kilometers) south of Seattle. Nelson tried to get Sarey into handcuffs. He resisted and Nelson tried a hip-throw and punched Sarey seven times. He pinned Sarey against the wall, pulled out his gun and shot him. Sarey fell to the ground.",
      "Nelson\u2019s gun jammed, he cleared it, looked around and then aimed at Sarey\u2019s forehead, firing once more. Nelson claimed Sarey tried to grab his gun, leading to the first shot. He said he believed Sarey had grabbed his knife during the struggle so he shot Sarey in self-defense. A witness disputed that claim.",
      "The case was the second to go to trial since Washington voters in 2018 removed a standard that required prosecutors to prove an officer acted with malice \u2014 a standard no other state uses. Now they must show the officer\u2019s force was unreasonable or unnecessary. In December, jurors acquitted three Tacoma police officers in the 2020 death of Manuel Ellis.",
      "\u201cJesse Sarey died because this defendant chose to disregard his training at every step of the way,\u201d Eakes told the jury in her closing argument. The shooting was \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable and unjustified,\u201d she said.",
      "Sarey was the third person Nelson has killed in his law enforcement career. Jurors did not hear evidence about Nelson\u2019s prior uses of deadly force.",
      "Nelson killed Isaiah Obet in 2017. Obet was acting erratically and Nelson ordered his police dog to attack. He shot Obet in the torso and Obet fell to the ground. Nelson fired again, fatally shooting Obet in the head. Police said the officer\u2019s life was in danger because Obet was high on drugs and had a knife. The city reached a settlement of $1.25 million with Obet\u2019s family.",
      "In 2011, Nelson fatally shot Brian Scaman, a Vietnam War veteran with mental issues and a history of felonies, after pulling Scaman\u2019s vehicle over for a burned-out headlight. Scaman got out of his car with a knife and refused to drop it; Nelson shot him in the head. An inquest jury cleared Nelson of wrongdoing.",
      "The City of Auburn settled a civil rights claim by Sarey\u2019s family for $4 million and has paid nearly $2 million more to settle other litigation involving Nelson\u2019s actions as a police officer. Nelson remains on unpaid leave with the Auburn department."

      "Woods was being held Wednesday in the Jefferson County Jail on a $50,000 cash bond. An attorney for Woods did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment.",
      "The investigation into her alleged misconduct began in September 2023 after an intern at the state investigation bureau discovered missing information in a case that Woods handled in 2018.",
      "The subsequent probe into other cases she had worked found Woods altered data to conceal tampering, deleted data that showed she failed to troubleshoot issues within the testing process and did not thoroughly document tests performed in case records, authorities said.",
      "In addition to 52 counts of forgery, she faces 48 counts of attempting to influence a public servant and one count each of perjury and cybercrime, for alleged misconduct between 2008 and 2023.",
      "A Colorado Bureau of Investigations internal affairs report released last year revealed that concerns about Woods\u2019 work first surfaced more than a decade ago. In 2014, a worker questioned her testing of evidence and in 2018 she was temporarily removed from working on DNA cases after being accused of data manipulation, the report said.",

      "Prosecutors gave Garrett Coughlin the chance to plead guilty to second-degree murder partly because they were unable to call Woods to testify in a case that relied mostly on circumstantial evidence.",

      "Officials said Wednesday that the response to Woods' alleged misconduct had cost more than $11 million.",
      "Among those costs, the Colorado Department of Public Safety last year asked the Legislature for $7.5 million to pay for an independent lab to retest up to 3,000 DNA samples and for district attorneys to review and potentially reprosecute cases that are affected by lab errors.",
      "State officials announced Tuesday they had hired a consulting firm to review the state's forensic program. Bureau of Investigations Director Chris Schaefer said in a statement that the hiring of Forward Resolutions LLC was part of the agency\u2019s effort to \u201chold itself accountable\u201d following the allegations against Woods.",

      "A federal judge is set to hear the first arguments in a multi-state lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the parents' immigration status",
      "A federal judge in Seattle is set to hear the first arguments Thursday in a multi-state lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the parents' immigration status.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour scheduled the session to consider the request from Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington. The case is one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and a number of immigrants rights groups across the country. The suits include personal testimonies from attorneys general who are U.S. citizens by birthright, and names pregnant women who are afraid their children won't become U.S. citizens.",
      "The order, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day, is slated to take effect on Feb. 19. It could impact hundreds of thousands of people born in the country, according to one of the lawsuits. In 2022, there were about 255,000 births of citizen children to mothers living in the country illegally and about 153,000 births to two such parents, according to the four-state suit filed in Seattle.",
      "The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them.",
      "The lawsuits argue that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship for people born and naturalized in the U.S., and states have been interpreting the amendment that way for a century.",
      "Ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, the amendment says: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and orders federal agencies to not recognize citizenship for children who don't have at least one parent who is a citizen .",
      "A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. After a trip abroad, he faced being denied reentry by the federal government on the grounds that he wasn\u2019t a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act.",
      "But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say it\u2019s less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally.",
      "Trump's executive order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation\u2019s first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 02:42:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Some U.S. House Republicans in California are breaking with Speaker Mike Johnson over his suggestion that federal disaster aid be coupled with as-yet unspecified conditions on the wildfire-ravaged state",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. House Republicans in California are breaking with Speaker Mike Johnson over his suggestion that federal disaster aid be coupled with as-yet unspecified conditions on the wildfire-ravaged state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- California Republicans are pushing back against suggestions by President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans that federal disaster aid for victims of wildfires that ravaged Southern California should come with strings attached, possibly jeopardizing the president's policy agenda in a deeply divided Congress at the outset of his second term.",
      "With Trump planning to visit the fire-ravaged state this week, resistance from even a few House members to his efforts to put conditions on disaster aid could further complicate an already fraught relationship between reliably liberal California and the second Trump administration.",
      "Several Republicans who narrowly won California House seats in November have expressed dismay that the state relief could be hitched to demands in exchange for helping the thousands of Californians in their districts still reeling from this month's disaster.",
      "\u201cPlaying politics with people\u2019s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,\" Republican Rep. Young Kim, whose closely divided district is anchored in fire-prone Orange County, southeast of Los Angeles, said in a statement.",
      "In an interview aired Wednesday night, Trump said he may withhold aid to California until the state adjusts how it manages its scarce water resources. He falsely claimed that California\u2019s fish conservation efforts in the northern part of the state are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should give California anything until they let the water run down,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.",
      "Local officials have said the conservation efforts for the delta smelt had nothing to do with the hydrants running dry as firefighters tried to contain blazes around Los Angeles. They said intense demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes was to blame.",
      "The wind-driven firestorms wiped out whole neighborhoods of Los Angeles County, left thousands homeless and killed more than two dozen people.",
      "Trump said earlier this week that discussions are underway in the White House to bring more water to perennially parched Los Angeles, alluding to rainfall runoff lost to the Pacific and the state's vast water storage and delivery system.",
      "\u201cLos Angeles has massive amounts of water available to it. All they have to do is turn the valve,\u201d the president said.",
      "California has long been a favorite target of Trump, who also referred to the fires in his inaugural address Monday. In LA, he said, \u201cwe are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.\"",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to change.\u201d",
      "Trump has made no mention of the multinational firefighting force deployed to contend with multiple blazes. Firefighters were gaining ground on the two major fires Wednesday when a third blaze broke out north of Los Angeles and quickly burned through hundreds of acres of dry brush.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican echoing Trump's complaints, has said there are \u201cserious\u201d problems in how the state is managed. Those include insufficient funding for forestry programs and water storage. He also noted the public dispute between the LA fire chief and City Hall over budget cuts.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass did not prepare the state or the city for what was to come. He particularly cited a 117-million-gallon reservoir left unfilled for nearly a year. Newsom has called for an independent investigation of the reservoir.",
      "Bass didn't directly respond to a question about possible conditions on disaster aid, saying in a statement: \u201cOur work with our federal partners will be based on direct conversations with them about how we can work together.\"",
      "Some Republicans have suggested that the congressional relief package could become entangled with efforts to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit \u2014 and with the House so closely divided, even a few breakaway votes from either party could alter the outcome.",
      "That leaves GOP lawmakers from California in a political quandary: whether to forcefully stand up for their home state, often pilloried by the GOP as representing all that is wrong with America, while Republicans in Congress are eager to show a unified front and parlay their November election wins into what Trump has called a new \u201cgolden age\u201d for the nation.",
      "Several California representatives agreed that the federal government must guard against the misuse of funds but argued that the money should not be held up or saddled with restrictions not placed on other states after tornadoes and hurricanes.",
      "The dilemma played out in social media posts by Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, who narrowly prevailed in November in his swing district east of Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cCalifornians are entitled to receive federal disaster assistance in the same manner as all Americans,\" he wrote on X. But, he quickly added, \u201cSome federal policy changes may be needed to expedite rebuilding as well as improve future wildfire prevention. Those kind of policies are not conditions.\u201d",
      "Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, whose sprawling district runs from east of Sacramento south to Death Valley, told KCRA-TV in Sacramento last week that Johnson's use of the word conditions was not \u201cespecially helpful.\u201d Speaking at the Capitol Wednesday, he said there is a lot of ambiguity about what constitutes conditions for disaster aid.",
      "He said his focus is to make sure the money doesn\u2019t get wasted through government inefficiency.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure the money actually gets to the victims and they can use it to rebuild their homes and to recover,\u201d Kiley said.",
      "Politicians in Washington have feuded for years over how to restrain the growing wildfire threat across the West. Republicans have long complained that inadequate land management practices have exacerbated damage from wildfires, while Democrats have emphasized the role of climate change and the failure of the federal government to address it.",
      "About the only thing they agree on is that the problem persists.",
      "Some lawmakers have noted that disaster aid over the years for Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana did not come with conditions. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries called the idea a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d",
      "Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, whose largely rural district runs from the Sacramento area north to the Oregon border, said he wasn\u2019t too concerned about talk of conditions.",
      "\u201cEverything has conditions, especially the way California wastes money,\u201d LaMalfa said. \"We want to help people and we want to help with that, like we\u2019ve helped with others. But California is very, very irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Trump plans to visit the state to see the damage firsthand on Friday. Newsom hasn't said publicly if he'll accompany him on his tour.",
      "With the fragile GOP majority in the House \u2014 there are 219 Republicans, 214 Democrats and one vacancy \u2014 Johnson cannot afford defections on any vote. And it could be several weeks before a fuller accounting of the state\u2019s recovery needs is ready and a formal request submitted to the White House.",
      "Following major natural disasters, the president typically makes supplemental spending requests, as happened after hurricanes Helene and Milton.",
      "Congress also could provide more disaster aid to California through legislation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he would work to include disaster aid in a filibuster-proof bill Republicans hope to craft this year that would pay for some of Trump\u2019s top policy priorities.",
      "Newsom urged Johnson and other congressional leaders to quickly approve assistance for the state, where fires are still burning and strong winds continue to threaten new ones. In an email to supporters from his campaign committee, he warned that \u201cRepublicans are holding federal aid hostage\u201d and said Democrats might be able to peel off a handful of GOP votes to push through an aid package.",
      "\u201cIn times of natural disaster \u2014 from Hurricane Katrina to Hurricane Helene \u2014 Americans have always stood together, setting aside politics to extend a helping hand to those in need,\u201d the governor wrote. \u201cHistorically, federal disaster aid has been provided without conditions.\u201d",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers used his seventh State of the State speech Wednesday to urge the Republican-controlled Legislature to enact a wide range of proposals they have rejected in the past, including numerous gun control measures just a month after there was a school shooting not far from the state Capitol.",
      "Here's what to know about the speech from Evers, a Democrat who may run for a third term next year in the battleground state:",
      "Evers, without mentioning President Donald Trump by name, said \u201cthere is a lot of angst about what may happen in the days, months, and years ahead.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have always been willing to work with anyone who is willing to do the right thing for the people of Wisconsin,\u201d Evers said. \u201cAnd that has not changed. But I will not compromise on our Wisconsin values of treating people with kindness, dignity, empathy, and respect.\u201d",
      "Evers called for bipartisan efforts to address immigration and promised to fight any attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He also repeated his pledge to veto any bill that limits access to abortion, birth control, infertility treatments, or any other part of reproductive care.",
      "Wisconsin is one of 22 states suing the federal government over Trump\u2019s attempt to end birthright citizenship.",
      "Wisconsin is one of the \u201cblue wall\u201d states that Trump won in 2016 but lost in 2020. Trump carried Wisconsin in 2024 on his way back to the White House.",
      "Evers called for a series of gun control measures five weeks after school shooting just six miles (9.66 kilometers) from the Capitol that left a teacher and 14-year-old student dead. The 15-year-old shooter shot and killed herself.",
      "Evers called for universal background checks for gun purchases and restoring a 48-hour waiting period for gun purchases, a law that Republicans repealed in 2015.",
      "He also called for banning the purchase of \u201cghost guns\u201d and closing a loophole that allows for domestic abusers to own firearms.",
      "Evers also called for incentives and new requirements to safely secure firearms and a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow judges to take guns away from people determined to be a risk to themselves or others.",
      "Republicans have repeatedly rejected the proposals in the past.",
      "\u201cWe cannot let common sense get lost in debates over whether basic policies could have prevented the most recent shooting, or the one before it, or the one before that,\u201d Evers said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t here in Madison to quibble about the semantics of the last shooting; we are here to do everything we can to prevent the next one.\u201d",
      "The governor last week created a state office for violence prevention, which Republicans vowed not to fund after federal funding runs out in two years.",
      "Evers, a former teacher and state superintendent of schools, also called for spending $300 million to provide comprehensive mental health services in schools statewide. That would be 10 times the amount the Legislature approved for school mental health services in the last budget.",
      "Declaring 2025 as \u201cThe Year of the Kid,\" Evers called on Republicans to approve $500 million to lower the cost of child care. The bulk of that would go toward funding the Child Care Counts program, for the next two years. Without more funding, the program \u2014 which was created during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 is slated to end in June.",
      "Evers also called for creating new programs designed to set price ceilings for prescription drugs and improve oversight of drug companies, removing the state sales tax on over-the-counter medications and capping the copay on insulin at $35.",
      "He also repeated his previous call for them to allow for voters to place proposed law changes on the ballot themselves through referendums, something that Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos declared \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d",
      "In an emotional moment, Evers welcomed the widow and parents of former state Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, who died by suicide in November. Evers, his voice cracking with emotion, talked about Brostoff's death when introducing a new program that would allow people to temporarily and voluntarily register to prevent themselves from purchasing a firearm.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center this summer. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",
      "She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon \u2013 an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?",

      "At the moment, the DWP can recover benefits debt from current claimants through the welfare system itself, whilst it can also deduct money from claimants who are employees through the PAYE system.",
      "It argues the ability to recover money from claimants' bank accounts directly would help reclaim funds from those no longer on benefits or who are self-employed, and ease pressures on the court system.",
      "Under the new legislation, the DWP would be able to compel banks to transfer over benefits debt through \"direct deduction orders\". Banks would be able to charge the claimant a fee to cover their administration costs.",
      "The department would be obliged to consider three months' worth of bank statements from the claimant first, and consider whether a deduction would mean they would suffer \"hardship in meeting essential living expenses\".",
      "But Daniel Cichocki, director in economic crime and policy strategy at UK Finance, said the plans need to be looked at further to ensure they don't \"create risks for vulnerable customers, or conflict with existing regulatory and legal obligations\".",
      "Mr Cichocki said he agreed with the principle of going after fraud, but called on the government to introduce controls to \"prevent fraud and error entering the benefits system in the first place\".",
      "UK Finance, which counts the vast majority of the big retail banks among its members, pointed to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) consumer duty as an area that it believes could be in conflict with the government's plans.",
      "The duty, introduced in 2023, set higher standards for consumer protection and gave banks a specific obligation to protect customers who are vulnerable due to their financial situation.",
      "A bank that breaks those rules can be penalised by the FCA, or the financial ombudsman.",
      "Data sharing concerns",
      "The banking industry is also understood to have concerns over new measures forcing them to hand over account information of claimants where there are indications they \"may have been\" paid benefits incorrectly.",
      "This could include the account holder's name, date of birth and account number, although transaction information would be excluded.",
      "The department can currently only demand such financial information where it has reason to suspect fraud, and only in individual cases.",
      "It argues greater access to banking information in bulk will allow it to catch cases of potential fraud that would otherwise go undetected, eventually saving the taxpayer around \u00a3500m a year once the system is fully rolled out.",
      "According to latest annual figures, overpayments due to fraud amounted to \u00a37.4bn last year, around 2.8% of total welfare spending.",
      "A further \u00a31.6bn (0.6%) was overpaid due to inadvertent errors by claimants, with \u00a30.8bn (0.3%) overpaid because of errors by the DWP.",

    "story": [
      "More than 100 Reddit communities have banned users from posting links to X in protest at owner Elon Musk's controversial arm gesture at a rally celebrating Donald Trump's return to office.",
      "The billionaire twice extended his arm out straight as he thanked the crowd for \"making it happen.\"",
      "Critics, including some historians, said it was a Nazi salute - Mr Musk has dismissed that, saying comparisons with Hitler were \"tired\" and \"dirty tricks.\"",
      "However many Reddit users have been unpersuaded by his response describing his actions as \"hateful\", leading the moderators of scores of communities - or subreddits - to stop content being shared on X.",
      "X has not commented but Reddit has stressed there is no sitewide ban on X links, telling the BBC in a statement it \"has a longstanding commitment to freedom of speech and freedom of association\".",
      "However the platform relies heavily on community moderation, where unpaid individuals known as Redditors decide what is - and isn't - allowed to be published on their own corner of the website.",
      "In many instances, those Redditors have reached a different conclusion, deciding Mr Musk's actions were so offensive that they won't link to content from their subreddits on X, potentially reducing traffic, engagement and - ultimately - revenue.",
      "The biggest subreddits to have enforced the ban include basketball community r/NBA, which has 15 million members, female-focused community r/TwoXChromosomes, which has 14 million members, and American football community r/NFL, which has 12 million members.",
      "It is worth remembering that subreddits are almost always run by fans - it does not mean that the NFL or NBA organisations are taking a stance against Musk.",
      "The BBC has independently verified that at least 100 subreddits have banned X posts.",
      "Of this number, more than 60 have at least 100,000 members.",
      "But the actual number that have instituted the ban will likely be significantly higher by taking into account smaller subreddits with only a few thousand members.",
      "And there are many more communities discussing a potential blacklisting.",
      "Who and why?",
      "The subreddits run by fans of football clubs Liverpool, Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur have all instituted the bans, as have communities for many US sports sides as well as Formula 1.",
      "The subreddits where residents of many cities and countries gather around the world - ranging from New Jersey to South Korea - have also blocked posts to X.",
      "And gamers are also amongst those to bring in the ban for video games including Baldur's Gate 3 and World of Warcraft.",
      "But while the blacklisting may have first started in some of these communities, it is popping up in a variety of places now where people gather to discuss all sorts of topics, ranging from RuPaul's Drag Race to Disneyland and even the military.",
      "While the vast majority of subreddits discussing a ban are in favour of it, there are some that have refused.",
      "The moderators of the Maine community for example say they won't institute a ban so long as \"the state maintain official accounts there\".",
      "And those running a group for people in British Columbia said they simply aren't \"doing censorship here\".",
      "Does it matter?",
      "Though there are many subreddits which already disallow posts from social media, those built around professional sports in particular may have a big impact on referrals to X.",
      "That's because sports subreddits generally get a lot of content from links to athletes, analysts and journalists who spend a lot of time posting online.",
      "For example, the top two most popular posts of all time on the NBA subreddits are screenshots taken from X, while three of the top ten most popular posts of all time on the AEW wrestling subreddit are screenshots from the platform.",
      "And gaming subreddits have a similar story, with the top posts on the Animal Crossing and Kingdom Hearts communities both screenshots from X.",
      "But that is not to say the bans will necessarily be permanent - Reddit is known for this sort of community movement to protest against wider issues, which doesn't always work out.",
      "In 2023, thousands of communities \"went dark\" to contest changes to how the platform was being run.",
      "Some of the biggest Reddit communities then began only allowing photos and videos of comedian John Oliver, following comments from disgruntled users.",
      "But this proved to be short-lived.",

      "He did not mention the US by name.",
      "During his election campaign, Trump threatened to hit Chinese-made products with border taxes known as tariffs of up to 60%, but he held off on any immediate tariff action on his first day, instead ordering his administration to study the issue.",
      "US goods imports from China have flattened since 2018, a statistic that economists have attributed in part to a series of escalating tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term.",
      "That stand-off ended in 2020 when the two countries signed a deal.",

      "But US officials say China has not upheld its side of the agreement.",
      "Speaking to Congress last week, Scott Bessent, whose confirmation as Treasury Secretary cleared a key hurdle on Tuesday, said he expected to push to enforce those agreements and raised the possibility of demanding \"catch up\" purchases as well.",
      "Trump has also lashed out at the imbalance in US trade with China, which sells overseas far more than it imports.",
      "In his speech at Davos, Ding said his country had eased restrictions on foreign investment, wanted to boost domestic consumption and was not seeking a \"trade surplus\".",
      "\"We want to import more competitive, quality products and services to promote balanced trade,\" he said.",
      "He acknowledged that economic globalisation could bring \"some tensions and disagreements on distribution\" but said it was not a \"zero-sum game, but a universally beneficial process where all can benefit\".",
      "\"Protectionism leads nowhere,\" he said. \"Trade war has no winners.\"",
      "He added: \"I believe that we have the wisdom and capability needed to find a win-win and all-win solution.",
      "\"We should not only make the pie of economic globalisation bigger, but also distribute it better.\"",
      "The IMF warned last week that a threatened wave of Trump tariffs would make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world."

      "The Confederation of School Trusts welcomed the changes - but said there were still parts of the bill that concerned them, including restrictions on bringing people with specialist subject knowledge (but not a specific formal teaching qualification) into the classroom.",
      "Badenoch told the Commons that the bill implies \"doctors are not sufficiently qualified to teach biology, that Olympic medallists can not teach PE\", and asked why the prime minister was closing routes into teaching.",

      "\"The bill benefits children who need the nourishment of a breakfast club, the bill benefits the families that can't afford uniforms, the bill benefits the children who are currently out of school and nobody knows where they are, the bill benefits the children who could be taken out of school by abusers if this bill doesn't go through.\"",

      "\"The shift was gradual, but in the Second World War English became a global language and so speaking and pronunciation became much more important.",
      "\"That was a catalyst for change, and I firmly believe that learning English opens doors.\"",
      "By the 1950s, there had been requests for the English exam to offer translation questions in dozens of different languages, ranging from Arabic to Vietnamese.",
      "Gillian Cooke, group archivist at CUP&A, said: \" I think the take up for each language was quite small and so that probably wasn't cost effective.",
      "\"It might be one of the reasons why the translation paper was dropped in the 1970s.\"",
      "The Cambridge English exam has continued to evolve.",
      "There are now different versions tailored to the needs of schools, higher education, and businesses.",
      "\"More than 100 million people across 130 countries have now sat our English exams,\" says marketing director for higher education, Ian Cook.",
      "\"They're recognised by more than 25,000 organisations from governments - which use them for immigration purposes - to employers and universities.",
      "\"Some universities in Germany, Sweden, and East Asia, for example, deliver IT and healthcare courses in English in order to attract the best candidates and so students need to show they have the language skills to cope with the course.\"",
      "Today, the exams are also available digitally and artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to create adaptive tests.",
      "\"In simple terms, the next question you're served up depends on how well you answered the previous one,\" says Mr Cook.",
      "\"And by offering a range of slightly more difficult and then easier questions as you go through, the technology will help to find your level.",
      "\"Our expertise and research have proven that the more teaching and tests are personalised, the better for students.",
      "\"We want people to have confidence, to pass - and show what they're capable of.\"",
      "Despite the changes, CUP&A insists that its approach is as much about continuity as innovation.",
      "Dr Galaczi adds: \"Examiners and AI work together in marking and setting content for the exams, so we harness the strengths of both the human being and the machine.\"",
      "How did you do?",
      "CUP&A says opinions about correct English grammar have changed, but in 1913, these would have been the expected answers:",
      "(a) This is a split infinitive which would have been considered wrong. It should have said \"to improve seriously\"",
      "(b) This is a hanging participle. It should have read \"Shakespeare is by no means inferior to Aeschylus\". Now we would say \"Shakespeare is just as good as\".",
      "(c) Wrong tense. It should be \"to make peace\".",
      "(d) \"Would admit\" not \"Will admit\".",

      "Best-selling author Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the current children's laureate, is to spearhead a campaign to tackle a \"recession in children's happiness\" that he believes is caused by a decline in reading at a young age.",
      "The writer has organised a summit in Liverpool on Wednesday, at which he will call on the government to \"stand up and give a visible sign this country values its children\".",
      "Cottrell-Boyce, whose books include Millions and Cosmic, will warn that while children in the UK may fare well in reading league tables, reading for pleasure is in decline, leading to \"less chance of [them] being happy\".",
      "The Reading Rights Summit will also hear from fellow authors Cressida Cowell and Michael Rosen, two of his predecessors as children's laureate.",
      "Cottrell-Boyce will implore politicians \"to make sure that every single child has access to books, reading and the transformative ways in which they improve long-term life chances\".",
      "The author will add that \"our children are near the top of the global leagues when it comes to the mechanical skill of reading but near the bottom when it comes to 'reading for pleasure.'",
      "\"That our children seem to be experiencing some kind of happiness recession at the moment is not surprising, and I believe that the decline in reading has played its part in this.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC ahead of his speech, the writer emphasised the benefits of help with reading in early years. \"It's easy to get depressed about the situation, but there's a huge amount of happiness and optimism to be drawn on,\" he said.",
      "A 2022 BookTrust survey of over 2,000 low-income families in England, Wales and Northern Ireland found less than half of children under seven are being read a bedtime story.",
      "Disadvantaged children who achieve highly at the end of primary school are twice as likely to have been read to at home in their early years compared with their peers, the charity found.",

      "Screen time is also an issue. In his speech, he will say he has heard about some children who \"instead of turning the pages, try to swipe them or make the pictures grow bigger with their fingers\" because they hadn't encountered a book before starting school.",
      "He will also say: \"Yes, it's important for educational attainment. Yes, DCMS (Department for Culture, Media and Sport), it's the most crucial - and most democratic - part of our cultural heritage.",
      "\"Shared reading is an effective, economic health intervention, so yes, it's essential, [Health Secretary] Wes Streeting, to mental health, to bonding, to attachment, to creating a situation where parents and carers can give the best, the most joyous start in life to our children.\"",

      "Many children's laureates have campaigned on similar issues, but Cottrell-Boyce told the BBC he was aiming his message more at the government than the public.",
      "He added: \"We're not talking about a huge undertaking. Some of the most amazing stuff I've seen, in terms of capital spend, has been some Pritt stick and two copies of [Rod Campbell's classic toddler book] Dear Zoo.",
      "\"The infrastructure is there but it's not joined up.\"",

      "Referring to the wildfires in Los Angeles, she continued: \"This is a time of incredible contrasts and right now, my heart is with my friends, family, neighbours, and community here in LA.\"",
      "In the best actor category, two big names are in contention for portraying the early years of very different real-life figures - Sebastian Stan for playing Donald Trump in The Apprentice and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for playing Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "That makes Chalamet, 29, the youngest person to get two best actor nominations since James Dean in the 1950s, according to Variety.",

      "Zoe Salda\u00f1a, who plays Perez's lawyer, is up for best supporting actress (despite having more screen time than Gasc\u00f3n). The film's only notable omission is Selina Gomez, who was an outsider for a nod in the same category for playing Perez's wife.",

    "story": [
      "A song recorded for Tina Turner's blockbuster album Private Dancer, that was presumed lost, has been rediscovered and received its first play on BBC Radio 2.",
      "Hot For You, Baby, was cut at Capitol Studios in Hollywood and originally intended to be an album track.",
      "But it was ultimately jettisoned in favour of era-defining pop hits such What's Love Got To Do With It, Better Be Good To Me and the album's title track.",
      "Presumed missing, the master tape was recently rediscovered as her record label compiled a 40th anniversary re-release of Private Dancer.",
      "An up-tempo rocker, full of showboating guitar chords and an extremely 1980s cowbell, Hot For You, Baby is a prime example of Turner's raspy, physical style of soul.",
      "The track was played on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show on Thursday, at 08:50 GMT.",
      "Produced by John Grant, the record executive who masterminded her mid-career comeback, it was written by Australian musicians George Young and Harry Vanda.",
      "It had already been recorded once by Scottish-Australian singer John Paul Young, the voice behind disco classic Love Is In The Air.",

      "Private Dancer, released in May 1984, launched an unprecedented second act in Tina Turner's career.",
      "She had escaped an abusive marriage to musician Ike Turner at the end of the 1970s, but the divorce left her penniless, living off food stamps and playing ill-conceived cabaret shows to pay her debts.",
      "The music industry had largely written her off - but in England, where pop was in thrall to American R&B, she still had some heavyweight fans.",
      "In 1981, Rod Stewart invited Turner to play with him on Saturday Night Live; and the Rolling Stones asked her to be part of their US tour. More importantly, perhaps, David Bowie told Capitol Records that Turner was his favourite singer.",
      "A landmark album",
      "But the turning point came when she hooked up with British producers Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, of the band Heaven 17, to record a synth-pop version of  the Temptations' 1970 hit Ball of Confusion.",
      "A huge hit in Europe, its success persuaded Capitol to let her record an album, but they hardly threw their weight behind it.",
      "The budget only paid for two weeks in the studio, and many of the songs Turner recorded were other artists' cast-offs (both Cliff Richard and Bucks Fizz had turned down What's Love Got To Do With It).",
      "But she used her time wisely - recording all but one of Private Dancer's songs in the UK with five different British production teams.",
      "With the country in the grips of new wave and the new romantics, Turner was steered away from raw, fiery soul that first made her famous. But somehow, her electrifying vocals were a perfect fit for the chilly, programmed grooves she was given.",
      "\"Turner seems to completely understand the touch that each of these songs needed,\" wrote Debby Miller, in a contemporaneous review of Private Dancer for Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "In the New York Times, Stephen Holden described the record as \"a landmark, not only in the career of the 45-year-old singer, who has been recording since the late 1950s, but in the evolution of pop-soul music itself\".",

      "Turner also performed the song on the live TV broadcast, wowing audiences with her vocals despite fighting a bad case of the flu.",
      "A support slot on Lionel Richie's US tour in 1984 reminded audiences of her ability to tear the roof off any venue she set foot in.",
      "By 1985, Turner was one of the world's biggest acts in an era of stadium superstars like Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince.",
      "The decision to withhold Hot For You, Baby from the original tracklist of Private Dancer makes sense. It sounds a little cheesy next to the sultry, sophisticated material that eventually populated the record.",
      "But fans will welcome the chance to hear Turner let rip, back in her prime, with a promise to \"love you all night long\".",
      "Mark Goodier, who is currently covering the Radio 2 breakfast show, said: \"To have something new to hear from Tina Turner is a treat for fans of all generations and a reminder of her unique talent.",
      "\"I'm lucky enough to have both interviewed Tina and seen her perform live. She was an outrageously good performer and at the same time a remarkable graceful lady, whose every note was shaped by her incredible life.\"",
      "As well as being released as a single, the track will feature on a new five-disc deluxe edition of Private Dancer, which is due for release in March.",
      "The collection will also feature B-sides, remixes and live tracks, as well as a film of Turner playing Birmingham's NEC Arena in March 1985, featuring guest appearances by David Bowie and Bryan Adams.",
      "Turner died in 2023 at the age of 83. No cause of death was given, but she was known to be struggling with a kidney disease, intestinal cancer and other illnesses."

      "Lively's lawyers said it showed him \"repeatedly leaning in toward Ms Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character\".",

      "Her legal documents said he wasn't speaking in character and that no sound was recorded.",
      "\"At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, 'it smells so good.'",

      "He said Lively apologised for the smell of her spray tan and body make-up. \"Baldoni responded, 'It smells good,' and continued acting, slow dancing as he believed his character would with his partner, which requires some amount of physical touching.\"",
      "Lively joked about Baldoni's nose, and that he should get plastic surgery, he said.",
      "\"Any suggestion that this scene was filmed in any manner other than pure professionalism by Baldoni is unequivocally countered with actual evidence,\" his documents added.",

      "He kisses her forehead then goes to kiss her on the lips before she apparently hesitates and they continue dancing. She then seems to turn her head with their faces close together and he kisses her cheek.",
      "She tells him: \"I think we should be talking. I think it's more romantic if we're like... dancing and talking.\" He agrees and says \"the whole montage is us talking\".",
      "She continues: \"Cause it's like the moment they kiss, then you give them the thing that they want to see.\"",
      "He replies: \"That's why almost kissing is also good.\" She responds: \"Yeah. But we're still talking.\"",

      "He tells her \"I know you and Ryan [Reynolds, her husband] talk all the time\", but he and his wife Emily like to stare at each other, joking that \"you would find it terrifying\". She laughs and jokes that \"I'd be like, 'Oh no I found a sociopath'\".",
      "He asks the camera operator to film their lips \"super close\", to which she agrees but adds that they should \"start talking\" and \"don't give it [the kiss] to them\". He agrees they should \"keep restraint\".",

    "title": "Dark humour for dark times: How comedy helps in Ukraine",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:06:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Ukrainian stand-up comedians say humour can help people cope and raise money for the war effort.",
    "story": [
      "On 14 October 2023, an unusual event was held in Ukraine's most prestigious venue, Palace Ukraine in Kyiv.",
      "Anton Tymoshenko became the first Ukrainian stand-up comedian to give a solo performance there.",
      "\"I grew up in a village with fewer people than Palace Ukraine can hold,\" he said after the concert. \"So many people had told me: It's not going to happen... stand-up comedy has not reached that level.\"",
      "It has now, to a large extent because of the full-scale invasion launched by Russia.",
      "The invasion turned many Ukrainians away from the previously popular and lavishly promoted Russian acts and triggered a renewed interest in Ukrainian culture.",
      "Key Ukrainian comedians say they are now making jokes to help the public deal with the grim reality of war and also help the army by raising funds.",
      "\"Stand-up comedy is a budget version of psychotherapy,\" Anton Tymoshenko tells the BBC.",
      "\"I like to relieve social tension with my jokes. When that happens, that's the best thing.\"",
      "Another popular performer, Nastya Zukhvala, says Russia's full-scale invasion in February gave stand-up comedy in Ukraine \"a boost,\" albeit for darker reasons.",
      "\"The demand for comedy looks totally natural to me now because comedy supports and unites.",
      "\"It can also make reality look less catastrophic. It is a tool which can help us process this stream of depressing information,\" she tells me.",
      "\"To stay optimistic or even sane, we've got no other choice.\"",
      "So what are the jokes that are making Ukrainians laugh?",
      "This kind of humour is grim, says comedian Hanna Kochehura, but making fun of the danger makes it easier to cope with.",
      "\"It looks even darker from abroad, and it's clear why. Anyone who's in Ukraine knows that there are no safe places here,\" she says.",
      "\"You never know if this air raid is going to be your last. You don't know if a Shahed drone is going to target your house or your family's house.",
      "\"Naturally, all our themes are related to the war. Because it's our life now. Stand-up comedy is a frank genre where comedians speak about their own experiences or thoughts,\" Ms Kochehura says.",
      "Here's an example - a joke from Anton Tymoshenko's performance at Palace Ukraine:",
      "\"I never worried about a nuclear attack because I know it would mean death for rich residents of Kyiv. I live on the outskirts - but the nukes will hit central parts. Before fallout reaches me, it will have to make two changes on the metro.",
      "\"More realistically, I'll get killed by Iranian Shahed drones. The sad thing is - did you hear the noise they make? They sound very demotivating, like the cheapest kind of death.\"",
      "\"People can laugh at the news,\" Anton tells me.",
      "\"If we're not allowed to use [Western] missiles against targets in Russia  \u2014 yes, that is funny because it is absurd. I build upon this absurd fact, and it becomes funny.",
      "\"Of course, Ukrainians find it funny.\"",
      "Western allies were initially reluctant to allow Ukraine to use their missiles against targets in Russia for fear of escalation. But the permission was granted after months of pleading by Kyiv: first shorter-range weapons in May 2024, then long-range missiles in November.",
      "Joking about the war is fraught with pitfalls.",
      "Anton Tymoshenko says he is trying not to \"trigger\" his audiences or add to the trauma from which they may already be suffering.",
      "\"Stand-up comedy in wartime is the most difficult type. Making jokes without offending anyone is possible to do, but that would be like joking in a vacuum,\" he says.",
      "But, it is usually possible to see where the line lies according to Nastya Zukhvala:",
      "\"I feel what other Ukrainians feel. If I find something sad or tragic, I don't see any need to turn it into stand-up comedy.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Teddy Swims turned up to the  MTV Awards last September, he was nominated for four prizes, including best new artist.",
      "In the event, the combined forces of Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter denied him a single Moon Man trophy \u2013 but the singer left with something much more valuable.",
      "\"I didn't realise until a couple of weeks later, but my partner and I conceived that night,\" he beams.",
      "\"We're due in June and things are great. I think we're gonna crush it.\"",
      "Domestic bliss isn't a quality that fans might associate with Teddy Swims.",
      "His huge breakthrough single Lose Control, and the hit album I've Tried Everything But Therapy, were rooted in dysfunction, addiction and heartbreak.",
      "They were inspired by a toxic, mutually destructive relationship from which he had escaped. In the past, he has described it as a \"really co-dependent lifestyle\" that went from \"bender to bender\" as both sides \"leveraged each other's shame against one another\".",
      "As he sings on a recent single, \"I saved my life when I showed you the door\".",
      "But that was only one chapter in the story of the 32-year-old Georgia native Jaten Dimsdale.",
      "This Friday, he releases a second album, I've Tried Everything But Therapy Part 2, that explains what happened next.",
      "\"I've learned that love doesn't have to be this thing of high highs and low lows \u2013 fighting and pulling teeth just to stay together,\" he says.",
      "\"The first album was a lot of turmoil, and not too much closure. So I wanted to come back and say, 'Here's me on the other side of this, and I'm doing better'.",
      "\"I feel like, as a listener, I would want to hear that there's a way out.\"",
      "His new partner is also a singer-songwriter, Raiche Wright, who he met \"a couple of Thanksgivings ago\" when she came to one of his shows - and the new album dwells in a sort of bewildered bliss.",
      "\"Are you something from a dream or something that I made up?\" he wonders on the slick R&B groove of Are You Real.",
      "Later, on the acoustic guitar ballad If You Ever Change Your Mind, he croons, \"I love you, I love you,\" with a quiet sincerity rarely found in a pop record.",
      "Musically, the album paints from the same palette as before \u2013 a brand of 1960s soul where dusty piano grooves and chugging guitar lines are punched up with a modern pop sheen, and a pinch of rock and roll swagger.",
      "But it's not all hearts and flowers. The sumptuous soul of Black And White makes a plea for tolerance, inspired by the prejudice Dimsdale and his partner \u2013 who has mixed black and white heritage \u2013 have faced.",
      "\"I see people looking disgusted because we're different colours \u2013 especially down South,\" he says.",
      "\"But it's okay to be happy in love with someone of a different colour, or a different size or shape, or the same sex, or whatever it is.",
      "\"Why would you be hating on that? It's such a backwards thing.\"",
      "Dimsdale learned about acceptance the hard way. Born in Conyers, an eastern suburb of Atlanta, his grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher with set views on the world, and family life was hard to navigate.",
      "His parents divorced when he was three and, although both remarried, their new relationships were problematic. His mother, with whom he lived, married an alcoholic who left suddenly when Dinsdale was 18 and never spoke to the family again.",
      "His father, who he saw at weekends, married a woman who developed serious mental health problems, including schizophrenia, and spent long stretches in hospital. His dad ended up raising Dimsdale's step-brothers almost single-handedly.",
      "\"He'd work 18 hours a day, and still get the homework done and still get to the practices, all by himself,\" he says.",
      "\"There's just not enough I can say about how amazing that man truly is.\"",
      "Dimsdale was a late bloomer when it came to music. As a youngster, he was a dedicated footballer, until a friend convinced him to audition for a school production of Damn Yankees.",
      "The musical sparked a love affair with singing. He researched vocal techniques on YouTube, soaking in performances by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.",
      "After graduation, he started playing with local metal bands, adopting the stage name \"Swims\" from internet forum-speak for Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes. Teddy, meanwhile, is a childhood nickname, based on his affable and cuddly persona.",
      "Old-fashioned success",
      "But it was a cover of Shania Twain's country ballad You're Still The One that earned him his big break.",
      "On YouTube, it's been watched 197 million times. One of those viewers was a talent scout for Warner Bros records, who signed Dimsdale to a record deal on Christmas Eve 2019.",
      "They partnered the musician with professional writers like Julian Bunetta (Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction) and Mikky Ekko (Rihanna, Drake) \u2013 but he also retained his high school band, Freak Feely, who play with him to this day.",
      "After three EPs, and hundreds of sessions, they wrote Lose Control, and Dinsdale instantly \"knew it was going to change my life\".",
      "He was right. With 2.2 billion global streams, it is one of the most successful songs in recent chart history - but finding an audience took time.",
      "There was no viral moment or TikTok trend associated with Lose Control. Instead, Dimsdale \"did it the old-fashioned way\".",
      "\"We showed up and did every damn interview possible,\" he says. \"We went to every office and radio station and shook every hand individually. We stopped everyone on the street, busking.\"",
      "He believes the personal touch beats everything, hands down.",
      "\"People love to see their friend win, so if you go out there and make time for them, it goes a lot further than a playlist coming across your desk, or a little file coming to your email that says, 'Hey, can you push this song?'",
      "\"And that's the old way you work a record, before streaming.\"",
      "Bashfully, he confesses the song made him a millionaire (\"so I can't be too mad at that girl any more, can I?\") but he's learning that making money means spending money.",
      "\"A million dollars goes so fast,\" he says. \"Once you put 66 people on a tour, with all the gear and all the lights, it's right out the door as fast as you get it.",
      "\"Twenty bucks still means what 20 bucks meant to me before, but the amount coming in and out is such a scary thing to look at sometimes.\"",
      "As we speak, he's in rehearsals in Pennsylvania, ahead of his first European arena tour, which includes two nights at Wembley this March.",
      "The stage has just been built for the first time, and he's eager to acquaint himself with all the ramps and video walls. The music\u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm already sick of the songs, but we've been playing them non-stop for two weeks now,\" he says. \"I can't wait 'til people sing along, so I can fall in love with them again.\"",
      "If you've been to a Teddy Swims show, you'll know he lays his heart on the line.",
      "There are countless videos of him sobbing as he performs Some Things I'll Never Know, a song about abandonment and grief. For the upcoming tour, he's playing it back-to-back with a new tear-jerker, Northern Lights, that dives even deeper into heartbreak.",
      "He's going to be a mess - but Dimsdale insists it's a good thing.",
      "\"Every day I try to cry a little bit,\" he says. \"It's just pain leaving the body.",
      "\"And it's a constant reminder that, whatever you were going through, on the other side of it there's happiness.\"",
      "With his bearded and tattooed face, you might not expect such emotional intelligence \u2013 but Dimsdale's model of masculinity wasn't afraid to share his feelings.",
      "\"I'm my daddy's son,\" he says. \"He's just a sensitive man. He'll tell you he loves you, he'll tell you he's proud of you. Man, I'll still sit there, laying in his arms while we're watching TV on the couch.\"",
      "\"He's the most beautiful, humble human being I've ever met. Second to only Jesus Christ.\"",
      "So, the obvious question: Is dad excited to become a grandfather?",
      "\"He's doing backflips,\" laughs the singer.",

    "summary": "The settlement between the prince and the Sun's publisher is a dramatic, high stakes, turnaround.",
    "story": [
      "The settlement between Prince Harry and News Group Newspapers is a dramatic, high stakes, turnaround. But it's courtroom drama without the court.",
      "Prince Harry's team hailed the deal that stopped the trial as a \"monumental victory\", receiving an undisclosed amount of \"substantial damages\" and an \"unequivocal apology\".",
      "They say he's been vindicated - but will there also, deep down, be some mixed feelings about not getting his day in court? Was this really \"slaying dragons\" of the tabloid press, as he'd celebrated after a previous win when he'd given evidence in court against Mirror Group Newspapers?",
      "Co-claimant Lord Tom Watson paid tribute to Prince Harry's tenacity in pursuing this case for so long, praising his \"bravery and astonishing courage\".",
      "While on the opposing side of the scrapped case, NGN says the agreement \"draws a line under the past\" and they reject the claims that would have been made in court about a corporate cover-up.",
      "When NGN has spent \u00a31bn on previous claims, they might think any extra spent on staying out of court was a win for them too.",
      "Why did Prince Harry strike a deal now?",
      "It seems a change from Prince Harry being adamant that this was about \"accountability\".",
      "\"The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,\" Prince Harry told a media event in New York last month, about why he was taking on the Murdoch press.",
      "\"The scale of the cover up is so large that people need to see it for themselves,\" he said.",
      "He was fully aware of the financial risks built into such civil disputes, but seemed determined to press on, not just for himself but for 1,300 claimants who he said had settled but had \"no justice\".",
      "\"Accountability\" was mentioned again in a statement read out on behalf of Prince Harry and Lord Watson.",
      "\"The time for accountability has arrived,\" but it meant in terms of calling on Parliament and the police to pursue what they called the \"unlawful activity now finally admitted\" and \"the perjury and cover ups along the way\".",
      "There was a similar call for a follow-up when Prince Harry won against the Mirror group newspapers, but there has been no imminent sign of action.",
      "Perhaps it shouldn't have been a surprise that there was a deal.",
      "There has always been immense pressure for a settlement, because the curve of civil law bends so strongly in that direction.",
      "Even if a claimant wins a case, they could end up paying the costs of their opponents, if the damages award is less than they have been offered.",
      "The legal costs and damages at stake in this case could have been \u00a310m. That's a big poker hand decision for anyone. Plus the unknown jeopardy of what might happen in the court case and what questions Harry might have faced on the witness stand. He might have had his case ruled out of time or had his claims rejected.",
      "The psychological cards would all have been stacked towards doing a deal. Does everyone have a price? Even when they're seen as the last man standing?",
      "In terms of the amount of damages paid to Prince Harry, or what he might do with the money, that hasn't been made public.",
      "But what Prince Harry's team have seized upon is the skyscraper scale of the apology - seeing it as a \"collapse\" of the NGN's denials.",
      "They might argue that even if he had fought the court battle and won, there wouldn't be any more to be gained.",
      "This has always been a very personal battle for Prince Harry, the battle with the tabloids touching on his childhood as well as his adult life. So it's significant that the apology includes an admission of a \"serious intrusion\" into the \"private life of Diana, Princess of Wales\".",
      "That could mean more to him than any financial deal.",
      "Prince Harry's team also repeated the claim that \"the Sun, the flagship title for Rupert Murdoch's UK media empire, has indeed engaged in illegal practices\".",
      "This references the apology's mention of \"unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the Sun\".",
      "NGN's statement emphasises that this applies to the activities of external private investigators, \"not by journalists\" on the Sun.",
      "But it narrows some of the fastidious distancing that there's been between what had happened at the shut down News of the World and the Sun.",
      "While the statement from Prince Harry's team lambasts those presiding over a \"toxic culture\" in parts of the media, past and present, and repeats its claim about a corporate cover-up, these are attack lines from a court case that will now never happen.",
      "NGN rejects the claims of a cover-up and the destruction of evidence. But the overall tone of the response is relief at the end of arguments over old battles, and that this now draws a line under all these disputes over front pages from decades ago.",
      "\"Indeed the judge made it clear in remarks in court at the end of the hearing that these cases are likely to be the last liable to go to trial,\" said NGN.",
      "The bombshell case that was going to see Prince Harry giving evidence against his tabloid tormentors is over before it began. Who, in the end, will be more pleased about that?",
      "Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?"

      "Her debut album, released to little fanfare in 2023, has just topped the UK charts for a second time. Next week, she's up for six Grammy awards, including best new artist. And BBC Radio 1 have named her their Sound Of 2025.",

      "\"She's super tiny, her breath smells so bad, and she doesn't have a meow,\" the singer dotes.",
      "If kitten ownership is a benefit of fame, Roan has bristled at the downsides.",
      "She has spoken out against abusive fans, calling out \"creepy behaviour\" from people who harass her in airport queues and \"stalk\" her parents' home. Last September, she went viral for cussing a photographer who'd been shouting abuse at stars on the red carpet of the MTV Awards.",
      "\"I was looking around, and I was like, 'This is what people are OK with all the time? And I'm supposed to act normal? This is not normal. This is crazy',\" she recalls.",
      "The incident made headlines. British tabloids called her outburst the \"tantrum\" of a \"spoiled diva\".",
      "But Roan is unapologetic.",
      "\"I've been responding that way to disrespect my whole life - but now there are cameras on me, and I also happen to be a pop star, and those things don't match. It's like oil and water.\"",
      "Roan says musicians are trained to be obedient. Standing up for yourself is portrayed as whining or ingratitude, and rejecting convention comes at a cost.",
      "\"I think, actually, I'd be more successful if I was OK wearing a muzzle,\" she laughs.",
      "\"If I were to override more of my basic instincts, where my heart is going, 'Stop, stop, stop, you're not OK', I would be bigger.",
      "\"I would be way bigger... And I would still be on tour right now.\"",
      "Indeed, Roan rejected the pressure of extending her 2024 tour to protect her physical and mental health. She credits that resolve to her late grandfather.",
      "\"There's something he said that I think about in every move I make with my career. There are always options.\"",
      "\"So when someone says, 'Do this concert because you'll never get offered that much money ever again', it's like, who cares?",
      "\"If I don't feel like doing this right now, there are always options. There is not a scarcity of opportunity. I think about that all the time.\"",
      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",

      "Mac Miller, real name Malcolm James McCormick, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and started making music at school.",
      "His debut album, Blue Slide Park, was the first independently released record to top the Billboard 200 chart in 16 years and all of his later albums followed the same path to the top five in the US.",
      "He wrote Balloonerism between labels in 2014 and producer Eric Dan, who worked with Mac since he was a teenager, tells Newsbeat he was \"just starting to come into his own\".",

      "Eric also says that after \"bootleg\" versions of the album were leaked, it was important an official release, in line with Mac's most up-to-date track lists, allowed the family to regain control of the album.",

    "story": [
      "The first study to assess how weight-loss drugs affect the whole of human health has discovered an \"eye-opening\" impact on the body, researchers say.",
      "The analysis, involving about two million people, linked the drugs to better heart health, fewer infections, a lower risk of drug abuse and fewer cases of dementia.",
      "The US researchers also warned the drugs were \"not without risk\" and seemed to increase joint pain and potentially deadly inflammation in the pancreas.",
      "However, the results need very careful interpretation.",
      "Weight-loss drugs have exploded in popularity - but a full understanding of everything they touch in the body is still coming together.",
      "\"This is new territory,\" said lead researcher Dr Ziyad al-Aly, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University.",
      "Initially, they were a proven treatment for type 2 diabetes. Then, weight loss was noticed as a significant side-effect - and Ozempic and Wegovy became household names.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The study used data on US veterans with type 2 diabetes, some of whom were given Ozempic or Wegovy and some more standard drugs - to measure their effect on 175 other illnesses.",
      "There appeared to be a significant boon to heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure, in those taking the new weight-loss drugs.",
      "They also cut the risk of substance abuse (including alcohol, opioids and cannabis) as well as reducing schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts and seizures.",
      "Despite the study being short, and people taking the drugs for only 3.5 years because of how new they are, it reported a 12% reduction in Alzheimer's disease.",
      "There was also less liver cancer, muscle pain and chronic kidney disease as well as a noted reduction in bacterial infections and fever.",
      "On the flip side, people were more likely to have problems in their digestive system. Feeling sick, tummy pain, inflammation in the stomach, diverticulitis (bulges in the intestines that can be painful) and haemorrhoids were more common on Ozempic or Wegovy.",
      "'Definitely eye-opening'",
      "The data, published in the journal Nature Medicine, also showed low blood pressure, including fainting, headaches, disturbed sleep, kidney stones, inflammation in the kidneys and a range of bone or joint pains, including arthritis, became more frequent.",
      "\"It was definitely eye-opening for me to see all these different hits in different organ systems,\" Dr Aly told BBC News.",
      "The explanations for the drugs' seemingly wide-ranging impact are both obvious and mysterious.",
      "Losing excess weight would in turn improve health. For example, lower levels of sleep apnoea \u2013 when breathing stops and starts while slumbering  \u2013 is thought to be down to losing weight around the tongue and throat, which can block the airways.",
      "But the drugs also appear to be directly altering the behaviour of cells and tissues in the body.",
      "Dr Aly said: \"Obesity is bad for the brain. Obesity is bad for mental health. Obesity is bad for the heart. Obesity could be the mother of all ills.\"",
      "Ozempic and Wegovy have the same active ingredient, semaglutide, in different doses, and mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1.",
      "Released by the gut after eating, GLP-1 travels through the blood and sticks to little receptors on the surface of brains cells.",
      "This tells the brain there is food in the stomach and is why people feel less hungry after eating.",
      "However, receptors that respond to GLP-1 are found throughout the body, including in the heart and some parts of the immune system.",
      "\"It is very clear this class of drugs seem to suppress reward mechanisms [in the brain so it] inhibits that urge to seek out alcohol, to seek out tobacco, to seek out gambling,\" Dr Aly said.",
      "Meanwhile, lower levels of inflammation, the alarm bell of the immune system, could have a wide range of health impacts.",
      "'Ozempic babies'",
      "The range of health benefits may strengthen the case for some people using the drugs, Dr Aly said.",
      "\"When you add more benefit, for the people who really are at risk of these conditions, that's an added plus,\" he said.",
      "But for those whose weight is not affecting their health, \"maybe the risk that they're buying themselves is actually much higher than the benefit\".",
      "However, the study has drawbacks that limit its findings.",
      "Most of the veterans were white men, so it did not include any female-specific effects, such as the anecdotal phenomenon of improved fertility and unexpected \"Ozempic babies\".",
      "And there could be reasons why some had been prescribed Ozempic or Weygovy, rather than other drugs, that could provide alternative explanations for some of the findings.",
      "Protective effect",
      "Thorough clinical trials have already proven benefits to heart health - and nausea is a known side-effect - but other findings will need to go through similar rigorous testing.",
      "Alzheimer's starts more than a decade before symptoms appear - but this study suggests just a few years on semaglutide has a protective effect.",
      "Trials are already under way to work out if this effect is real.",
      "\"Such trials will lead us much closer to the truth,\" Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said.",
      "\"Fortunately\u2026 several will report out in the next one to four years.\"",
      "And while \"interesting\", he said this latest study's findings were not strong enough to influence how the drugs were prescribed.",
      "Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said the study needed to be interpreted \"carefully\" but provided \"useful reassurance\" about the drugs' safety in people with diabetes.",
      "And further studies in other patients were \"awaited with interest\".",
      "The \"most surprising finding\" was the increase in joint pain, since weight loss should reduce pressure on the joints.",
      "But the fact some cells in the immune system had GLP-1 receptors meant the impact of these drugs was \"somewhat unpredictable\" and while some inflammatory disorders may be eased, \"others might conceivably be exacerbated\", Prof O'Rahilly said.",

    "summary": "Axel Rudakubana, 18, was jailed for a minimum of 52 years for the murders of three girls.",
    "story": [
      "The MP for Southport, where Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls, has demanded a review of the killers 52-year jail sentence - arguing it is \"not harsh enough\".",
      "Labour's Patrick Hurley has asked the Attorney General to review if the sentence was \"unduly lenient\" claiming it does not \"reflect the crimes\".",
      "Rudakubana cannot apply to leave prison until the year 2077 after pleading guilty to the murders of Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, eight.",
      "The killings triggered a wave of political outrage, including from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who called the attack, which wounded eight more children, \"one of the most harrowing moments in our country's history\".",
      "'Terrorism has changed', says PM on Southport attacks",
      "'I knew I was running for my life': How the Southport attack unfolded",
      "How red flags over Southport killer were repeatedly missed",
      "In a statement Sir Keir said: \"What happened in Southport was an atrocity and as the judge has stated, this vile offender will likely never be released.\"",
      "But Hurley argued Rudakubana's sentence \"is not severe enough, it is not long enough for the crimes committed\".",
      "Attorney General Lord Hermer and Solicitor General Lucy Rigby now have 28 days to decide if they will refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal.",
      "Critics of the judge's decision would have to convince the Court of Appeal that the sentence - believed to be the second-longest minimum term ever - is not just shorter than they would have wanted, but \"unduly\" so.",
      "Because Rudakubana acted nine days shy of turning 18, by law he cannot be sentenced to a whole-life order - which would mean he could never be released from jail.",
      "Hurley joined Tory leader Kemi Badenoch in calling for law change to allow for whole life orders to be imposed on people aged under 18 in some cases.",
      "Badenoch said \"Rudakubana should never be released from prison\" after destroying \"countless lives\" and sowing a \"legacy of mistrust\" across the country.",
      "The Conservatives \"will start to explore\" how to change the law, she said.",
      "Despite the severity of the attack the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided the attack did meet the legal definition of terrorism, due to a lack of evidence Rudakubana sought to advance any political, religious, or ideological agenda.",
      "But Badenoch called the attack a \"terrorist\" incident, and called on others to stop \"avoiding these hard truths\".",
      "Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage demanded the CPS chief resign for failing to class the case as terrorism.",
      "\"This barbaric and senseless attack was clearly both political and ideological,\" Farage said.",
      "\"The British public needs to have confidence in the CPS and our police forces. Tens of millions of British citizens will find it incomprehensible how the CPS decided this was a non-terror incident and maintained that position.\"",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned Rudakubana's attack as \"horrendous, cowardly, and evil\" and said the government had pledged to hold a national inquiry.",
      "\"We have vowed to get the answers the country deserves about how this horror was allowed to happen and to ensure that lessons are learned,\" she said.",
      "Further details would be set out soon, she said, but added \"for today, all our thoughts are with the families enduring this unimaginable pain, and the example of strength and courage they have provided to us all\".",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp backed the inquiry, but accused the government of overseeing an information vacuum after Rudakubana's arrest, which sparked a wave of riots across the UK last summer.",
      "Philp is one of many critics that have accused the CPS and government of withholding key details after the attack, such as Rudakubana's three referrals to anti-extremism programme Prevent, his creation of enough ricin to kill 12,000 people and the extent of his fixation on violence and genocide.",
      "Posting on social media, Philp said: \"The prime minister and CPS could have been more open with the public. This would have avoided misinformation filling the void, and fuelling the riots.",
      "\"The inquiry must address this issue too.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey backed the inquiry, calling on the government to fulfil its \"urgent duty to the families and our country to learn the lessons from what happened\".",
      "\"As a father I have found it difficult to read the sickening details about what happened in Southport that day, inflicting an indelible trauma on so many and taking three innocent lives.",
      "\"I cannot imagine the enduring pain their families are still going through. No punishment will ever seem like enough.\"",
      "In response to the attack two Reform UK MPs, Rupert Lowe and Lee Anderson, called for the return of the death penalty.",
      "Mr Lowe said it was \"time for a national debate\" on the use of capital punishment \"in exceptional circumstances\", while Mr Anderson posted a picture of a noose on his X account, with the caption: \"No apologies here. This is what is required!\""

      "The Independent Parliament Standards Authority (Ipsa) report said Labour's landslide election had been a \"once in a generation event\" which saw 350 MPs leave office - more than at any general election in the last fifty years.",

      "MPs' severance pay to double at next election",
      "At the 2019 election only 460 members of staff were effectively made redundant.",

      "Costs included ending rental agreements, settling outstanding payments and making staff redundant.",
      "MPs themselves were entitled to a loss of office payment, set at twice the legal minimum, if they lost their seat and had been an MP for at least two years.",
      "All MPs who either lost or stood down were also eligible for so-called \"winding up\" payments worth four month's salary. Since April 2024, the basic annual salary of a MP is \u00a391,346, plus expenses.",
      "This was to compensate them for the time spent closing down their offices, which was extended at this election from two months to four. They could also claim costs during this time.",
      "Ipsa said an average of \u00a335,200 was spent per MP on redundancy payments to both MPs and their staff - up from an average of \u00a319,900 at the 2019 election.",
      "Ipsa's chair Richard Lloyd said: \"An MP's office is like a small business. They are the employer, and any MP not returned in the 2024 general election had until 4 November to close down their office entirely.\"",
      "He added: \"Ipsa is proud of its role in supporting a representative Parliament, where people without private finances shouldn't be prevented from becoming an MP - or working for one.\"",
      "Established in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal, Ipsa oversees both MPs' pay and expenses, including the salaries of the constituency caseworkers, parliamentary assistants and other staff that work for them."

      "The UK banking industry has warned that government plans to crackdown on benefit fraud could leave banks at risk of breaking consumer protection rules.",
      "A new law unveiled on Wednesday would allow the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to reclaim money from accounts without a court order.",
      "Ministers argue this will speed up the debt recovery process and help contribute to a wider crackdown on benefits fraud.",

      "Had he been a Westminster MP, he would have been subject to a recall petition which, if signed by 10% of his electorate, would have triggered a new by-election.",
      "There have been longstanding calls for the system to change, but the issue has come to a head recently, as the Senedd prepares to expand to 96 members with a new electoral system.",

      "Party A fields a list of candidates in constituency B at the next Senedd election.",
      "Candidate one is elected, but then is found to have broken Senedd rules in a way that is serious enough for the standards committee to recommend a recall process.",

    "summary": "The UK joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention is up for discussion in reset talks, says Maros Sefcovic.",
    "story": [
      "The European Union's new trade chief responsible for post-Brexit negotiations has told the BBC a \"pan-European [customs] area is something we could consider\" as part of \"reset\" discussions between the UK and EU.",
      "Maros Sefcovic referred to the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "These are common rules that allow parts and ingredients for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in and around Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade.",
      "Downing Street has indicated such an agreement would not cross the government's \"red lines\" for its relationship with the EU.",
      "The BBC understands the UK government has begun consultations with business over the benefits of the PEM plan that could help cut red tape and improve trade. No final decision has been made yet.",
      "The Conservatives did not pursue PEM as part of its post-Brexit deal, but some  businesses have said it will help the UK rejoin complex supply chains that have been hit by customs barriers.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Sefcovic said the idea has not been \"precisely formulated\" by London yet and the \"ball is in the UK's court\".",
      "Under the Brexit deal, UK goods sold to the bloc are not subject to tariffs provided they are made with a certain percentage of materials from Britain or the EU.",
      "If a UK clothing manufacturer makes garments mainly from textiles it has sourced from Turkey - which is not in the EU - and sells them into the EU, the firm importing the goods would pay a tariff.",
      "But if the UK joined the PEM Convention - of which Turkey is a member - the firm buying the products would not pay tariffs.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said joining PEM \"would reduce paperwork and costs for many UK firms as it would align rules and regulations on both sides in relation to the sourcing of components and raw materials used in exports\".",
      "Speaking at Cabinet Office Questions, Europe Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said: \"We don't currently have any plans to join PEM.\"",
      "However, a Number 10 spokesman did not rule out future membership of PEM.",
      "\"The arrangement that's been discussed is not a customs union,\" he said, when asked if PEM membership would cross the red lines set out in Labour's manifesto for EU ties.",
      "\"Our red line has always been that we will never join a single market, freedom of movement, but we're just not going to get ahead of those discussions.\"",
      "No plans to join Europe trade scheme, says minister",
      "Brexit fishing row heads for trade court showdown",
      "Rachel Reeves signals wider reset of EU relations",
      "Dame Emily Thornberry, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said the post-Brexit agreement negotiated by the Tories had \"all kinds of holes\" in it.",
      "\"Within that agreement there is a mechanism for improving it, and we need to seize that opportunity,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"We need to make sure that within the constraints of the vote to leave the European Union, we nevertheless do everything that we can to get rid of barriers to trade with our nearest neighbours and the people who we trade with the most.\"",
      "Mr Sefcovic also said that a full-scale veterinary agreement that helped reduce frictions on farm and food trade should be reviewed.",
      "Single market treatment for UK food and farm exports would mean \"we would have to have the same rules and we have to upgrade them at the same time, we call it dynamic alignment\", he said.",
      "Dame Emily described the current agreement as \"uneven and difficult\".",
      "\"At the moment the reality is that for reasons of capacity, food coming in from the EU isn't really checked and yet food from Britain is checked a lot going into the EU,\" she said.",
      "The EU-UK fisheries deal is also due to expire next year. \"A solution for fisheries is very important for the EU, again, we communicated this on multiple occasions,\" Mr Sefcovic said.",
      "Youth mobility",
      "He also said he was surprised at how a European Commission proposal on youth mobility had been \"spun\" in the UK.",
      "The scheme would allow 18 to 30 year-olds from the EU to travel, work and study in the UK for a period, \"with reciprocity for young UK nationals\", according to the European Commission.",
      "Both Labour, when it was in opposition, and the then-Tory government rejected the idea, stating that free movement within the EU had ended with Brexit.",
      "But Mr Sefcovic said it was hoped the scheme would \"build bridges for the future for the European Union and the UK\".",
      "\"That was the idea,\" he said. \"[But] we've been a little bit surprised what kind of spin it got in the UK.",
      "\"It is not freedom of movement,\" Mr Sefcovic added. \"We have been very clear what we've been proposing.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Mr Sefcovic said that relations between the UK and the EU were \"definitely\" in a better place and his British counterpart Nick Thomas-Symonds was \"on speed dial\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will attend a defence and security focused EU summit next month.",
      "As well as relations with the UK, Mr Sefcovic acknowledged that the EU needed to be \"extremely cautious and responsible\" in addressing trade with the Trump administration in Washington but said he was willing to negotiate.",

      "It was at this point, three months after the Southport attacks, that police made public for the first time that the ricin and manual had been found.",
      "He was not charged with preparing for acts of terrorism because, under current laws, this would involve finding evidence of a political motivation or ideology, and none had been found.",
      "The prime minister suggested on Tuesday the laws defining terrorism might need to change to take account of \"loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom\".",
      "Neil Basu, former counterterrorism chief at the Metropolitan Police, told Radio 4's Today programme that he thought doing so would be a mistake.",
      "\"Bad legislation is made in haste in response to shocking incidents,\" he said. \"We need to think very carefully about the unintended consequences.\"",
      "Mr Basu said the people the prime minister pointed to were not terrorists but rather \"violent individuals\" who use \"any ideology as an excuse for their violent actions\". As such, some would \"revel\" in being branded a terrorist.",
      "Adding to the workload of counter-terror teams would also \"come with a very large bill\", Mr Basu said.",
      "Lord Carlile, who previously served as the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, agreed with Sir Keir that it was \"high time\" to review the definition of terrorism in UK law to include lone attackers who do not have a clear motivation.",
      "He told BBC Breakfast that he thought Rudakubana being a British citizen should have been made public far quicker, as claims about him being a migrant helped fuel the riots.",
      "But he said regarding the other details that it was \"not for the prime minister, or for retired police officers, or for the police, or for the newspapers to prejudice a trial by disclosing material that could undermine the integrity of that trial\".",
      "Rudakubana has now pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced and will be sentenced on Thursday.",
      "Normally the risk of jeopardising the case falls away once all charges have been decided, either by a plea, or a jury reaching a verdict.",
      "Crime reporters attended a police and CPS-led briefing setting out the entire case - but on Monday, the CPS again decided the information should not be published, this time until after the sentencing.",
      "Despite that, the prime minister and home secretary have both given details about the case in the Commons.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's deputy official spokesperson told political reporters on Tuesday afternoon that the prime minister had \"not strayed\" into areas related to sentencing.",
      "Yet the CPS insists it needs to protect the sentencing process due to take place on Thursday.",
      "Nick Price, CPS director of legal services, said: \"The next stage of the process is for the prosecution to present our full case to the court on Thursday - including relevant details of the defendant's past - so the judge can consider all the evidence when passing sentence.",
      "\"This will be the point when the full details of this case will be heard by the public.",
      "\"We recognise the profound interest in these proceedings, and it is important the prosecution case is presented to the court so the facts can be determined which may inform the sentence handed down.\"",
      "The CPS has taken this position because it believes the judge is entitled to make factual findings about the case and must also determine what weight to attach to different aspects of the evidence.",
      "However, the Crime Reporters Association, representing around 50 senior crime and home affairs correspondents, has written to the CPS raising concerns that the service is breaching a long-established principle that there is no legal risk in publishing material about a case after guilty pleas and before sentencing.",
      "The CPS said in its response that the \"independence of the judge must be respected\"."

      "The British-trained barrister, 40, is one of Bangladesh's so-called \"disappeared\". These were critics of Sheikh Hasina, the country's prime minister of more than 20 years, in two terms, until she was deposed last August.",
      "Hasina's regime ruled over the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971 in which hundreds were killed, including at least 90 people while she clung to power on her last day in office.",
      "Controversial in her own right, Hasina is also the aunt of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq - who resigned as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's anti-corruption minister last week after a slew of corruption allegations that she denied.",
      "These included claims Siddiq's family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh - and that she used properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",
      "The government's ethics watchdog later found she did not break the ministerial code, but Siddiq resigned anyway.",
      "That isn't necessarily the end of the matter, though.",
      "Questions for Starmer",
      "The episode raises troubling questions about Starmer's judgement and Labour's approach to courting the votes of people of Bangladeshi heritage.",
      "Questions are now swirling over why Labour failed to see this coming, given the party has long known about Siddiq's links to her scandal-hit aunt. It was 2016 when Bin Quasem's case was first raised with her.",
      "He and others among Bangladesh's \"disappeared\" have represented an awkward tension with Siddiq's publicly voiced views on human rights in the years since.",
      "She long campaigned for the release from Iran of her constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, for example, while showing an apparent comparative indifference in her public statements to the suffering and extrajudicial killings under her aunt's regime in Bangladesh.",
      "Siddiq has also previously appeared alongside her aunt at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared on BBC television as a spokesperson for the Awami League, the political party Hasina has led since 1981.",
      "Siddiq also thanked Awami League members for helping her election as a Labour MP in 2015. Two pages on her website from 2008 and 2009 setting out her links to the party were later removed.",
      "Yet once in Parliament Siddiq told journalists that she had \"no capability or desire to influence politics in Bangladesh\".",
      "So these links weren't a secret, but perhaps they weren't viewed as a bad thing within Labour, not least since it has shown little sign of distancing itself from the Awami League in recent years.",
      "Then-Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick told the Commons in 2012 that they were \"sister organisations\", a warmth shared by many of his colleagues.",
      "And Starmer - who entered Parliament in 2015 at the same time as Siddiq in her neighbouring seat - has met Hasina multiple times.",
      "This included in 2022 when the then-Bangladeshi PM was in London for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, a meeting that Bin Quasem calls \"heartbreaking and shocking\".",
      "A Starmer ally argues it is \"perfectly legitimate\" for him to have met Hasina, and it did not amount to an endorsement of her policies.",
      "The apparent attempts by Labour over the years to keep Bangladesh on side might reflect the political reality here in the UK, especially in parts of the capital city.",
      "\"You can't succeed in east London without understanding the Bangladeshi vote\", one seasoned Labour campaigner explains.",
      "However, those who fail to appreciate the country's divided and volatile politics can end up offending those they are attempting to charm. \"You need to carefully balance what you say and do,\" the campaigner says. \"If you are too overt for one [Bangladeshi] party, you'll get criticised.\"",
      "Analysis by the FT suggests there are at least 17 UK constituencies where the voting-age Bangladeshi population is larger than the Labour majority.",
      "Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency has at least 6,000 adult residents of Bangladeshi origin.",
      "A potential blind spot",
      "Might this mix of warmth and political pragmatism have clouded Starmer's judgement from a potential corruption storm on the horizon when, shortly after winning the election in July, he appointed Siddiq as the Treasury minister responsible for leading Britain's anti-corruption efforts?",
      "\"Starmer has blindspots for his friends and political allies,\" says a Labour source. \"It's not new.\"",
      "Investigative journalist David Bergman, who has been shedding light on Siddiq's connections to Bangladeshi politics for a decade, points out context is everything. \"This was not a major story until Labour got into power, Tulip Siddiq became a minister and the Awami League government fell,\" he says.",

      "How Bangladesh's protests ended  Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign",
      "He argues someone in the party should have raised concerns many years before. \"There was first a blind spot about Tulip Siddiq's failure to respond to enforced disappearances in Bangladesh,\" Bergman argues.",
      "\"Then there was a blind spot about how tied she was to the UK Awami League.\"",
      "When I put this to one Labour MP, they responded that the UK media, as well as Labour, have had a Bangladesh blind spot.",
      "\"There are some 600,000 people in the British Bangla diaspora\", they say. \"It is a country with the eighth largest population on Earth yet we've not heard a peep [from the UK media] since the events of 5 August.\"",
      "The corruption investigations into Hasina are likely to rumble on for some time, potentially bringing further issues for Starmer's top team to address in the months ahead while Siddiq remains a Labour MP.",

      "The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays.",
      "That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021.",

    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

      "Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.",
      "That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action.\"",
      "Trump has floated the possibility of TikTok becoming a joint venture, telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance, though he did not give any further details on how that might work.",
      "For now though the order creates a situation where the president is directly opposing a ruling made by the Supreme Court, which upheld the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "It said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Technically, even after the 75 days have passed, it would be possible for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",

      "Experts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to fully restore TikTok don't succeed.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center this summer. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",

      "The case has sparked a debate about attitudes toward marital consent and women's rights in France. Lilia Mhissen, H.W.'s lawyer, said the decision dismantled the outdated concept of \"marital duty\" and called for French courts to align with modern views on consent and equality.",
      "Women's rights groups supporting H.W. said French judges continue to impose an \"archaic vision of marriage,\" which perpetuates harmful stereotypes.",
      "H.W., who lives in Le Chesnay near Paris, married her husband, JC, in 1984. They had four children, including a daughter with a disability who required constant care, a responsibility H.W. took on.",
      "Their marital relations deteriorated after the birth of their first child and by 1992, H.W. began experiencing health problems. In 2002, her husband started physically and verbally abusing her. Two years later, she stopped having sex with him and petitioned for divorce in 2012.",
      "The woman did not dispute the divorce, which she had also requested, but objected to the grounds on which it was granted.",
      "In 2019, an appeals court in Versailles rejected her complaints and ruled in favour of her husband. The Court of Cassation, France's highest court, later dismissed her appeal without explanation. She then brought her case to the ECHR in 2021.",
      "The ECHR ruled that governments should only intervene in matters like sexuality for very serious reasons. It stated that the idea of \"marital duties\" in French law ignored the importance of consent in sexual relations.",
      "The court emphasised that agreeing to marry does not mean agreeing to have sex in the future. Suggesting otherwise, the ruling said, would effectively deny that marital rape is a serious crime.",
      "The ruling comes amid growing attention to consent in France, following the high-profile trial of Dominique P\u00e9licot, who drugged his wife and invited men to rape her. P\u00e9licot and the 50 men involved were convicted last month, and the case raised concerns about how French law addresses consent.",
      "Feminist groups argue that the ECHR decision reinforces the need to update French laws and cultural attitudes.",
      "A recent report by French MPs has recommended including the concept of non-consent in the legal definition of rape, stating that consent must be freely given and can be withdrawn at any time.",

      "\"We are extremely pleased that a new agreement has been reached that will deliver billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver treatment and overdose rescue medicines that will save lives,\" Purdue said in a statement.",
      "The deal still needs court approval, and some of the details are yet to be ironed out, but AP said it is among the largest settlements reached in a series of lawsuits by local, state, Native American tribal governments and others seeking to hold companies responsible for the deadly epidemic.",
      "Under President Donald Trump, the federal government is not expected to oppose the new deal, according to AP.",

      "Analysts anticipated that Russia would reduce its military footprint from Syria following the fall of the Assad regime in December - which it supported throughout the civil war.",
      "Large quantities of military hardware have been moved to the port in recent weeks and have been visible in satellite photos analysed by BBC Verify.",
      "The imagery appears to show dozens of vehicles and other equipment sitting at the port. The hardware first appeared in mid-December following footage of large columns of Russian vehicles moving north towards the base - indicating they had been redirected from other outposts across the country.",
      "The ships arrival coincides with reports in Syrian media that Russia's lease for the port has been cancelled. The new transitional government in Damascus refused to confirm the reports to the BBC, while Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also declined to comment when asked during a news conference in Moscow.",
      "Tartous has been a key base for Russia in recent years, allowing it to refuel, resupply and repair vessels in the Mediterranean.",
      "The Kremlin has appeared keen to retain control over the base, and said in December that Russian officials were speaking to the new authorities about a continued presence.",
      "Analysts have suggested that the Sparta and the Sparta II - which are ultimately owned by Oboronlogistika LLC - a shipping company which operates as part of the Russian ministry of defence, were denied permission to dock at Tartous while discussions continued. The ships have spent several weeks off the coast of Syria in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Marine tracking sites show the ships finally docked on Tuesday evening, after which they switched off their transponders.",
      "The weather in recent days has made it difficult to obtain clear satellite pictures. But images from the EU's Sentinel radar satellites - which are low resolution but capable of penetrating cloud cover - revealed that the ships were in the military section of the port.",
      "Until now, no Russian military vessels had been spotted at Tartous since the fall of Assad regime in early December. In earlier high-resolution satellite imagery dozens of military vehicles could be seen parked near where the vessels are now docked. Also nearby were cranes which may be used to load equipment.",
      "It is possible that two other Russian naval vessels are also present in the port, naval analyst Frederik Van Lokeren told BBC Verify. He said the vessels, Ivan Gren and the Alexander Otrakovsky, could also be involved in an evacuation - a sentiment echoed by Ukrainian military intelligence to BBC Verify.",
      "\"With the 49 year lease being cancelled it has become very clear for Russia that it can no longer hope to maintain a military presence in Tartous and as such, there appears to be no point in staying there and delaying the maritime evacuation any longer,\" Mr Van Lokeren added.",

    "story": [
      "Ayghad never thought that his dream of returning to his farmland could turn into a nightmare.",
      "He fights his tears as he shows us a picture of his late father, smiling and surrounded by abundant olive trees in their land in Idlib province, northwestern Syria.",
      "The picture was taken five years ago, a few months before forces linked to the former government took over their village, near the city of Saraqeb.",
      "The city was a strategic stronghold for Syrian opposition factions for years, before forces allied with the fallen regime of Bashar al-Assad launched an offensive against rebels in Idlib province at the end of 2019.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of residents fled their homes, as Assad forces took over several other rebel strongholds in the northwest by early 2020.",
      "Ayghad and his father were among those displaced.",
      "\"We had to leave because of the fighting and air strikes,\" Ayghad says, as the tears fill his eyes. \"My father was refusing to leave. He wanted to die in his land.\"",
      "The father and son longed to return ever since. And when opposition forces regained control of their village in November 2024, their dream was about to come true. But disaster soon struck.",
      "\"We went to our land to harvest some olives,\" Ayghad explains. \"We went in two separate cars. My father took a different route back to our home in the city of Idlib. I warned him against it, but he insisted. His car hit a landmine and exploded.\"",
      "Ayghad's father died instantly at the scene. Not only did he lose his dad that day, but he also lost his family's main source of income. Their farmland, spread across 100,000 square metres, was filled with 50-year-old olive trees. It's now been designated a dangerous minefield.",
      "At least 144 people, including 27 children, have been killed by landmines and unexploded remnants of war since Bashar al-Assad's regime fell in early December, according to the Halo Trust, an international organisation specialising in clearing landmines and other explosive devices.",
      "The Syria Civil Defence - known as the White Helmets - told the BBC that many of those killed were farmers and landowners who were trying to go back to their land after the Assad regime collapsed.",
      "Unexploded remnants of war pose a grave threat to life in Syria. They're mainly split into two categories. The first are unexploded ordnances (UXOs) like cluster bombs, mortars and grenades.",
      "Hassan Talfah, who heads the White Helmets team clearing UXOs in north-western Syria, explains that these devices are less challenging to clear because they are usually visible above ground.",
      "The White Helmets say that, between 27 November and 3 January, they cleared some 822 UXOs in north-western Syria.",
      "The bigger challenge, Mr Talfah says, lies in the second category of munition \u2013 landmines. He explains that former government forces planted hundreds of thousands of them across various areas in Syria - mainly on farmland.",
      "Most of the deaths recorded since the Assad regime fell happened on former battle front lines, according to the White Helmets. Most of those killed were men.",
      "Mr Talfah took us to two huge fields riddled with landmines. Our car followed his on a long, narrow and winding dirt road. It's the only safe route to reach the fields.",
      "Along the sides of the road, children run around the area. Hassan tells us they are from families who have recently returned. But the dangers of mines surround them.",
      "As we get out of the car, he points to a barrier in the distance.",
      "\"This was the last point separating areas under the control of government forces from those held by opposition groups\" in Idlib province, he tells us.",
      "He adds that Assad forces planted thousands of mines in the fields beyond the barrier, to stop rebel forces from advancing.",
      "The fields around where we stand were once vital farmlands. Today, they are all barren, with no greenery visible except for the green tops of land mines that we can see using binoculars.",
      "With no expertise in clearing land mines, all the White Helmets can do for now is cordon these fields off, and hammer down signs along their borders warning people off.",
      "They also spray-paint warning messages on dirt barriers and houses around the edges of the fields. \"Danger \u2013 landmines ahead,\" they read.",
      "They lead campaigns to raise awareness among locals about the dangers of entering contaminated lands.",
      "On our way back, we come across one farmer in his 30s who has recently returned. He tells us that some of the land belongs to his family.",
      "\"We couldn't recognise any of it,\" Mohammed says. \"We used to plant wheat, barley, cumin and cotton. Now we cannot do anything. And as long as we cannot cultivate these lands, we will always be in poor economic condition,\" he adds, clearly frustrated.",
      "The White Helmets say they have identified and cordoned off around 117 minefields in just over a month.",
      "They are not the only ones working to clear mines and UXOs, but it seems that there is little co-ordination between the efforts of various organisations.",
      "There are no accurate statistics for the areas contaminated with UXOs or landmines. But international organisations, such as the Halo Trust, have drawn up approximate maps.",
      "Halo Syria programme manager Damian O'Brien says that a comprehensive survey needs to be done for the country to understand the scale of contamination. He estimates that around a million devices would need to be destroyed to protect civilian lives in Syria.",
      "\"Any Syrian army position is quite likely to have some landmines laid around it as a defensive technique,\" Mr O'Brien says.",
      "\"In places like Homs and Hama, there are entire neighbourhoods which have been almost completely destroyed. Anybody going into those structures to assess them, for either demolition or to rebuild them, needs to be aware that there may well be unexploded items in there, whether it's bullets, cluster munitions, grenades, shells.\"",
      "The White Helmets came across a treasure trove that could aid efforts in clearing mines. In their office in the city of Idlib, Mr Talfah shows us a stack of maps and documents, left behind by government forces.",
      "They show locations, numbers and types of mines planted in different fields across northwestern Syria.",
      "\"We will hand over these documents to the bodies that will deal with landmines directly,\" Mr Talfah says.",
      "But the local expertise currently available in Syria does not seem to be enough to combat the serious dangers that unexploded munitions pose to civilian life.",
      "Mr O'Brien stresses that the international community needs to work alongside the new government in Syria to improve expertise in the country.",
      "\"What we need from donors is the funding, to be able to expand our capacity, which means employing more people, buying more machines and operating over a wider area,\" he says.",
      "As for Mr Talfah, clearing UXOs and raising awareness about their dangers has become a personal mission. Ten years ago, he lost his own leg while clearing a cluster bomb.",
      "He says that his injury, and all the heart-breaking incidents he's witnessed of children and civilians impacted by UXOs, have only fuelled his persistence to keep working.",
      "\"I never want any civilian or team member to go through what I have,\" he says.",
      "\"I cannot describe the feeling I get when I clear a danger threatening the life of civilians.\"",
      "But until international and local efforts are coordinated to neutralise the danger of landmines, the lives of many civilians, especially children, remain at risk."

      "Local news showed residents near the Hughes fire hosing down their homes and gardens with water and others rushing to evacuate.",
      "Winds in the area were blowing at about 20-30mph (32-48km/h), but could pick up, which would fan the blaze and make it harder for air crews to operate.",

      "Wednesday's stabbing in Aschaffenburg is the latest in a string of violent and fatal attacks that have involved suspects who have sought asylum in Germany.",

      "It is known as A23a and is one of the world's oldest.",
      "It calved, or broke off, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986 but got stuck on the seafloor and then trapped in an ocean vortex.",
      "Finally, in December, it broke free and is now on its final journey, speeding into oblivion.",
      "The warmer waters north of Antarctica are melting and weakening its vast sides that extend up to 1,312ft (400m), taller than the Shard in London.",
      "It once measured 3,900 sq km, but the latest satellite pictures show it is slowly decaying. It is now around 3,500 sq km, roughly the size of the English county of  Cornwall.",
      "And large slabs of ice are breaking off, plunging into the waters around its edges.",
      "A23a could break into vast segments any day, which may then hang around for years, like floating cities of ice cruising uncontrollably around South Georgia.",
      "This isn't the first huge iceberg to threaten South Georgia and Sandwich Islands.",

      "Sailors and fisherman say icebergs are an increasing problem. In 2023 one called A76 gave them a scare when it came close to grounding.",
      "\"Chunks of it were tipping up, so they looked like great ice towers, an ice city on the horizon,\" says Mr Belchier, who saw the iceberg while at sea.",

      "A76 was a \"gamechanger\", according to Mr Newman, with \"huge impact on our operations and on keeping our vessel and crew safe\".",
      "All three men describe a rapidly changing environment, with glacial retreat visible year-to-year, and volatile levels of sea ice.",
      "Climate change is unlikely to have been behind the birth of A23a because it calved so long ago, before much of the impacts of rising temperatures that we are now seeing.",

      "\"It can't be without the United States... Even if some European friends think it can be, no, it will not be,\" he said, adding that no-one else would risk such a move without the US.",
      "While Ukraine's leaders might appreciate this tougher-talking Trump - they have always said Putin only understands strength - the initial reaction in Kyiv to the US president's comments suggest that it is actions people are waiting for, not words.",

      "On social media, there was a generally scathing response to Trump's comments from Ukrainians. Many suggested that more sanctions would be a weak reply to Russian aggression. But the biggest question for most is what Putin is actually open to discussing with Ukraine at any peace talks.",

      "Russian hardliners, the so-called \"Z\" bloggers, are furious at such \"defeatism\".",
      "In his BBC interview on Thursday, Trump's former envoy Volker said he was \"sceptical that there is going to be a deal per se\", adding that the first priority of the US could be to stop the fighting and then deter more attacks by Putin.",
      "In Wednesday's social media post, Trump also couched his threat of tariffs and tighter sanctions in words of \"love\" for the Russian people and highlighted his respect for Soviet losses in World War Two \u2013 a near-sacred topic for Putin.",

    "summary": "LGBT couples now have the same rights as any other couple - the culmination of a decades-long campaign.",
    "story": [
      "When Thailand's long-awaited equal marriage law came into effect on Thursday,  police officer Pisit \"Kew\" Sirihirunchai hoped to be among the first in line to marry  his long-term partner Chanatip \"Jane\" Sirihirunchai.",
      "And he was - they were the sixth couple to register their union at one of Bangkok's  grandest shopping malls, in an event city officials helped organise to celebrate this legal milestone.",
      "Hundreds of couples across Thailand received marriage certificates on Thursday, breaking into smiles or tearing up over the moment they had dreamed of for so long.",
      "It was a pageant of colours and costumes as district officials hosted parties with photo booths and free cup cakes - one Bangkok district was giving air tickets to the first couple who registered their marriage there.",
      "\"The rainbow flag is flying high over Thailand,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra wrote on Facebook from Davos where she is attending the World Economic Forum.",
      "Activists said they were hoping to cross the 1,448-mark for registrations by the end of Thursday - 1448 is the clause in the Thai Civil Code covering the definition of marriage.",
      "\"We have been ready for such a long time,\" Pisit said. \"We have just been waiting for the law to catch up and support us.\"",
      "The two men have been together for seven years. Eager to formalise their relationship, they had previously been to a Buddhist monk to give them an auspicious new last name they can share \u2013 Sirihirunchai. They had also asked local officials to issue a letter of intent, which they both signed, pledging to get married.",
      "But they said having their partnership recognised under Thai law is what they had been waiting for: \"This is perfect for us. The law that protects our rights.\"",
      "'A long fight full of tears': Why Thailand became a haven for LGBT couples",
      "Until now, official documents listed Pisit and Chanatip as brothers. That way they could be a family in the eyes of the law. A marriage certificate means LGBTQ+ couples now have the same rights as any other couple to get engaged and married, to manage their assets, to inherit and to adopt children.",
      "They can also make decisions about medical treatment if their partner becomes ill and incapacitated, or extend financial benefits \u2013 such as Pisit's government pension \u2013 to their spouse.",
      "\"We want to build a future together \u2013 build a house, start a small business together, maybe a caf\u00e9,\" he adds, making a list of all that the law has enabled. \"We want to build our future together and to take care of each other.\"",
      "The law, which passed in both houses of parliament in June last year before being endorsed by the Thai king in September, is a big step for LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Thailand remains an outlier in Asia in recognising marriage equality - only Nepal and Taiwan have legalised same-sex unions.",
      "It's one reason why Aki Uryu, who is Japanese, moved to Bangkok to be with her partner. She said life is difficult for the LGBTQ+ community back home: \"In Thailand, I can hold hands with my partner, walk together. No one says anything. It's just different. It feels right.\"",
      "After the two women married on Thursday, Aki said: \"It is like I have started my new life.\"",
      "Watching them celebrate, along with so many other couples in a Bangkok mall, was Mr Zhang, a gay Chinese man who did not want to reveal his first name.",
      "\"We're excited, we're also very jealous,\" he said. \"Thailand is so close to China, but in another sense it's so far away.\"",
      "And yet, even in Thailand, with its famed tolerance towards LGBTQ+ people, activists say it took a sustained campaign to win legal recognition.",
      "A long wait",
      "\"We've been waiting for this day for 18 years - the day everyone can recognise us openly, when we no longer need to be evasive or hide,\" 59-year-old Rungtiwa Thangkanopast, who will marry her partner of 18 years in May, told the BBC earlier this week.",
      "She had been in a marriage, arranged by her family, to a gay man, who later died. She had a daughter, through IVF, but after her husband's death began spending time, and later helping run, one of the first lesbian pubs in Bangkok. Then she met Phanlavee, who's now 45 and goes by her first name only.",
      "On Valentine's Day 2013 the two women went to the Bang Rak district office in central Bangkok to ask to be officially married - a popular place for marriage registration because the name in Thai means \"Love Town\".",
      "This was the time when LGBTQ+ couples began challenging the official view of marriage as an exclusively heterosexual partnership by attempting to get marriage certificates at district offices.",
      "There were around 400 heterosexual couples waiting with them on that day. Rungtiwa and Phanlavee were refused, and the Thai media mocked their effort, using derogatory slang for lesbians.",
      "Still, activists managed to persuade the government to consider changing the marriage laws. A proposed civil partnership bill was put before parliament, offering some official recognition to same-sex couples, but not the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.",
      "A military coup in 2014 which deposed the elected government interrupted the movement. It would be another decade before full marriage equality was approved by parliament, in part because of the rise of young, progressive political parties that championed the cause.",
      "Their message resonated with Thais \u2013 and attitudes too had changed. By this time, same-sex marriage was legalised in many Western countries and same-sex love had become normalised in Thai culture too.",
      "Such was the shift in favour of the law that it was passed last year by a thumping majority of 400 votes to just 10 against. Even in the notoriously conservative senate only four opposed the law.",
      "And couples like Rungtiwa and Phanleeva now have their chance to have their love for each other recognised, without the risk of public derision.",
      "\"With this law comes the legitimacy of our family,\" Rungtiwa says, \"We're no longer viewed as weirdos just because our daughter isn't being raised by heterosexual parents.\"",
      "The new law takes out gender-specific terms like man, woman, husband and wife from 70 sections of the Thai Civil Code covering marriage, and replaces them with neutral terms like individual and spouse.",
      "However, there are still dozens of laws in the Thai legal code which have not yet been made gender-neutral, and there are still obstacles in the way of same-sex couples using surrogacy to have a family.",
      "Parents are still defined under Thai law as a mother and a father. The law also does not yet allow people to use their preferred gender on official documents; they are still stuck with their birth gender. These are areas where activists say they will still need to keep pushing for change.",
      "And it is especially significant for older couples, who have had to ride out the shifts in attitude.",
      "\"I really hope people will put away the old, stereotypical ideas that gay men cannot have true love,\" said Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira.",
      "He and his partner Prinn, both in their 40s, have been together for 24 years.",
      "\"The two of us have proved that we genuinely love each other through thick and thin for more than 20 years,\" Chakkrit said. \"We have been ready to take care of each other since our first day together. We are no different from heterosexual couples.\"",
      "While Chakkrit's parents quickly accepted their partnership, it took Prinn's parents seven years before they could do so.",
      "The couple also wanted to share the production business they ran together, and other assets, as a couple, so they asked Prinn's parents to adopt Chakkrit officially, giving him the same family name. Prinn says the new law has brought welcome legal clarity to them.",
      "\"For example, right now when a same sex couple buy something together \u2013 a large item - they cannot share ownership of it,\" said Prinn. \"And one of us passes away, what both of us have earned together cannot be passed on to the other. That's why marriage equality is very significant.\"",
      "Today, said Prinn, both sets of parents treat them as they would just like any other married children.",
      "And when they had relationship problems like any other couple, their parents helped them.",
      "\"My dad even started reading gay magazines to understand me better. It was quite cute to see that.\"",

      "Junjie says he was restrained and beaten by hospital staff before being forced to take medication.",
      "His ordeal began in 2022, after he protested against China's harsh lockdown policies. He says his professors spotted him after just five minutes and contacted his father, who took him back to the family home. He says his father called the police, and the next day - on his 18th birthday - two men drove him to what they claimed was a Covid test centre, but was actually a hospital.",
      "\"The doctors told me I had a very serious mental disease\u2026 Then they tied me to a bed. The nurses and doctors repeatedly told me, because of my views on the party and the government, then I must be mentally ill. It was terrifying,\" he told the BBC World Service. He was there for 12 days.",
      "Junjie believes his father felt forced to hand him over to the authorities because he worked for the local government.",
      "Just over a month after being discharged, Junjie was once again arrested. Defying a fireworks ban at Chinese New Year (a measure brought in to fight air pollution) he had made a video of himself setting them off. Someone uploaded it online and police managed to link it to Junjie.",
      "He was accused of \"picking quarrels and troublemaking\" - a charge frequently used to silence criticism of the Chinese government. Junjie says he was forcibly hospitalised again for more than two months.",

It also explicitly states psychiatric admission must be voluntary unless the patient is a danger to themselves or others.",
      "In fact, the number of people detained in mental health hospitals against their will has recently surged, a leading Chinese lawyer told the BBC World Service. Huang Xuetao, who was involved in drafting the law, blames a weakening of civil society and a lack of checks and balances.",

      "Lijian says he was arrested for attending a protest demanding better pay at a factory. He says police interrogated him for three days before taking him to a psychiatric hospital.",
      "Like Junjie, Lijian says he was prescribed anti-psychotic drugs that impaired his critical thinking.",
      "After a week in the hospital, he says he refused any more medication. After fighting with staff, and being told he was causing trouble, Lijian was sent for ECT - a therapy which involves passing electric currents through a patient's brain.",

    "story": [
      "On 14 October 2023, an unusual event was held in Ukraine's most prestigious venue, Palace Ukraine in Kyiv.",
      "Anton Tymoshenko became the first Ukrainian stand-up comedian to give a solo performance there.",
      "\"I grew up in a village with fewer people than Palace Ukraine can hold,\" he said after the concert. \"So many people had told me: It's not going to happen... stand-up comedy has not reached that level.\"",
      "It has now, to a large extent because of the full-scale invasion launched by Russia.",
      "The invasion turned many Ukrainians away from the previously popular and lavishly promoted Russian acts and triggered a renewed interest in Ukrainian culture.",
      "Key Ukrainian comedians say they are now making jokes to help the public deal with the grim reality of war and also help the army by raising funds.",
      "\"Stand-up comedy is a budget version of psychotherapy,\" Anton Tymoshenko tells the BBC.",
      "\"I like to relieve social tension with my jokes. When that happens, that's the best thing.\"",
      "Another popular performer, Nastya Zukhvala, says Russia's full-scale invasion in February gave stand-up comedy in Ukraine \"a boost,\" albeit for darker reasons.",
      "\"The demand for comedy looks totally natural to me now because comedy supports and unites.",
      "\"It can also make reality look less catastrophic. It is a tool which can help us process this stream of depressing information,\" she tells me.",
      "\"To stay optimistic or even sane, we've got no other choice.\"",
      "So what are the jokes that are making Ukrainians laugh?",
      "This kind of humour is grim, says comedian Hanna Kochehura, but making fun of the danger makes it easier to cope with.",
      "\"It looks even darker from abroad, and it's clear why. Anyone who's in Ukraine knows that there are no safe places here,\" she says.",
      "\"You never know if this air raid is going to be your last. You don't know if a Shahed drone is going to target your house or your family's house.",
      "\"Naturally, all our themes are related to the war. Because it's our life now. Stand-up comedy is a frank genre where comedians speak about their own experiences or thoughts,\" Ms Kochehura says.",
      "Here's an example - a joke from Anton Tymoshenko's performance at Palace Ukraine:",
      "\"I never worried about a nuclear attack because I know it would mean death for rich residents of Kyiv. I live on the outskirts - but the nukes will hit central parts. Before fallout reaches me, it will have to make two changes on the metro.",
      "\"More realistically, I'll get killed by Iranian Shahed drones. The sad thing is - did you hear the noise they make? They sound very demotivating, like the cheapest kind of death.\"",
      "\"People can laugh at the news,\" Anton tells me.",
      "\"If we're not allowed to use [Western] missiles against targets in Russia  \u2014 yes, that is funny because it is absurd. I build upon this absurd fact, and it becomes funny.",
      "\"Of course, Ukrainians find it funny.\"",
      "Western allies were initially reluctant to allow Ukraine to use their missiles against targets in Russia for fear of escalation. But the permission was granted after months of pleading by Kyiv: first shorter-range weapons in May 2024, then long-range missiles in November.",
      "Joking about the war is fraught with pitfalls.",
      "Anton Tymoshenko says he is trying not to \"trigger\" his audiences or add to the trauma from which they may already be suffering.",
      "\"Stand-up comedy in wartime is the most difficult type. Making jokes without offending anyone is possible to do, but that would be like joking in a vacuum,\" he says.",
      "But, it is usually possible to see where the line lies according to Nastya Zukhvala:",
      "\"I feel what other Ukrainians feel. If I find something sad or tragic, I don't see any need to turn it into stand-up comedy.\"",
      "There's also a very practical side to stand-up comedy in Ukraine - helping its army.",
      "\"Almost all of the comedians I know have been helping the armed forces. All of us are involved in raising funds [for the Ukrainian army]. We hold charity shows and many perform in front of the military,\" says Hanna Kochehura.",
      "Some, like Nastya Zukhvala's husband Serhiy Lipko, a comedian himself, are in the army.",
      "\"Culture, humour or psychology - that's all fine and well, but everything must be of practical use to the military. When so many missiles are on the way to hit you, you're not as interested in talking about art alone,\" says Mr Tymoshenko.",
      "\"My main task is holding concerts so I can raise funds for them.\"",

    "story": [
      "For more than 50 years, one family has dedicated itself to caring for the biggest graveyard in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna - much to the gratitude of other residents who do not fancy the job of dealing with the dead.",
      "Until a few weeks ago, they did it for no formal pay - digging graves, washing corpses and tending to the vast cemetery, receiving only small donations from mourners for their labour.",
      "The vast Tudun Wada Cemetery was set aside for the Muslim residents of the city by the authorities a century ago.",
      "The Abdullahi family became involved in the 1970s when two brothers - Ibrahim and Adamu - began working there.",
      "The two siblings now lie beneath the soil in the graveyard, and their sons have become the cemetery's main custodians.",
      "\"Their teachings to us, their children, was that God loves the service and would reward us for it even if we don't get any worldly gains,\" Ibrahim Abdullahi's oldest son Magaji told the BBC when asked why they had chosen to continue as unpaid undertakers.",
      "The 58-year-old is now in charge at Tudun Wada - shepherding operations and the 18 members of staff or until recently - volunteers.",
      "He and his two younger cousins - Abdullahi, 50, and Aliyu, 40, (Adamu Abdullahi's sons) - are the three full-time workers, all reporting in by 07:00 for a 12-hour shift, seven days a week.",
      "They always need to be on call because, according to Muslim rites, a burial must be organised within a few hours of someone's death.",
      "Magaji tends to get the call on his mobile, either directly from a relative or an imam - all religious clerics in the city have his number.",
      "\"A lot of people have our numbers and as soon as someone dies, we get a call and immediately we get to work,\" he says.",
      "One of the trio goes to tend to the corpse, which may include washing it and wrapping it in a shroud.",
      "The body is measured and those details are texted back to the others so that a grave can be dug.",
      "This can take around an hour - with two people taking it in turns to dig down 6ft (1.8m) into the earth - sometimes longer when it is in a stony area of the graveyard.",
      "They can dig around a dozen graves in a day - hard work in the Kaduna heat.",
      "\"Today alone we have dug eight graves and it's not even noon, some days are like that,\" says Abdullahi, who began work at the cemetery when he was aged 20.",
      "The cousins have experienced very stressful times - especially during religious violence when tensions flare between the city's Christian and Muslim residents. The two communities tend to live on opposite sides of the Kaduna River.",
      "\"We have had a couple of religious clashes in Kaduna but the one that sticks the most for me was one in the early 1990s. A lot of people were killed,\" says Magaji.",
      "\"We went round gathering the corpses and taking them off the streets.\"",
      "Muslims were taken to Tudun Wada in the north of the city and Christians to graveyards in the southern suburbs.",
      "\"It was such a troubling time personally and I wasn't long in the job then but that helped enhance my resolve to continue,\" he says.",
      "Usually, while the team digs a grave, at the local mosque the imam announces during one of the five daily prayers that a funeral will be taking place.",
      "Many of the worshippers then go to where the body has been prepared for prayers - it is then transported to the graveyard for burial, often thronged by the mourners.",
      "Once by the graveside, the shrouded body is lowered - it is covered with a layer of sticks and broken clay pots as a mark of respect. The grave is then filled to form a slightly raised bed.",
      "After the rituals are complete and before the mourners leave, the graveyard keepers appeal for donations.",
      "This is usually done by 72-year-old Inuwa Mohammed, the oldest worker at the cemetery, who explains the importance of Abdullahi family to the community.",
      "He used to work with the cousins' fathers: \"They were amazing people who loved what they did and have imbibed their children with this altruistic behaviour.\"",
      "The little money collected will sometimes buy lunch for the crew - but is never enough for anything else. In order to survive, the family also has a small farm where they grow food.",
      "The graves are recycled after 40 years, meaning land is not a big issue - but maintenance is.",
      "\"There is a lot that is lacking at the moment - we don't have enough equipment to work with, or good security,\" says Aliyu, the youngest of the cousins and who has worked there for 10 years.",
      "He explains how part of the wall has collapsed, allowing those on the look-out for scrap metal to steal the grave markers.",
      "Some of the graves have metal plates inscribed with a name and date of birth and death \u2013 though many do not as Islamic clerics do not encourage ostentation. Most are just outlined by stones and bricks or with a stick.",
      "Either way, the cousins remember the location of everyone buried at the cemetery and can direct people if they have forgotten the location of a relative's grave.",
      "Following the BBC's recent visit to the graveyard, they have seen a dramatic change in fortune.",
      "The new local council chairman, whose office oversees the site, has decided to put them on the payroll.",
      "\"They deserve it, given the massive work they do every day,\" Rayyan Hussain tells the BBC.",
      "\"Graves are the final homes for us all and people who do this kind of hard work deserve to be paid, so my office would pay them as long as I am chairman.\"",
      "Magaji confirms that the staff have started receiving a monthly salary for the first time:",
      "the five oldest, including himself, are getting 43,000 naira ($28; \u00a322.50)the others, including Abdullahi and Aliyu, are receiving 20,000 naira ($13; \u00a310.50).",

    "summary": "Some survivors did not hear a fire alarm and there are claims of failures in the hotel's fire safety.",
    "story": [
      "The fire that killed 78 people at the Grand Kartal Hotel in the early hours of Monday is one of the deadliest disasters of its kind in Turkish history.",
      "Some survivors have said they did not hear an alarm and experts have told the BBC they would not have expected such a high death toll in a hotel where fire protection systems were working properly.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "The 12-storey hotel at Turkey's popular Kartalkaya ski resort hosts tens of thousands of visitors every year, so Turks understandably want to know how such a terrible tragedy could have happened at the start of a two-week school holiday.",
      "The interior minister said the fire started at 03:27 (00:27 GMT) in the restaurant area on the fourth floor and firefighters arrived within 45 minutes.",
      "Some survivors have described smelling smoke as much as an hour earlier.",
      "Culture and Tourism minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the hotel had a fire competence certificate \"issued by the fire department\".",
      "But that has been challenged by local mayor Tanju Ozcan, who said the fire department had not issued a positive report since 2007.",
      "Some survivors say they heard no alarm, while there have been claims of inadequacies in the hotel's fire extinguishing systems.",
      "\"My wife smelled the fire,\" said Atakan Yelkovan, who said he was staying on the third floor of the hotel.",
      "\"We went down earlier than others. The alarm did not go off... It took about an hour to an hour-and-a-half for the fire brigade to come. In the meantime, the fourth and fifth floors were burning. People on the upper floors were screaming.\"",
      "Some guests on higher floors tried to escape with their bedding and some jumped to their deaths.",
      "Eylem Senturk said the fire alarm did not go off until she was out of the building. Her husband had to jump off the hotel porch because of the smoke: \"We are very lucky to have survived.\"",
      "The BBC has tried to contact the hotel's managers regarding these allegations but has so far received no response.",

      "In such a big building where fire systems are fully operational, experts say fire detectors are expected to respond to a fire within seconds and send an alert to a fire control dashboard.",
      "\"In a good business, there should be someone in charge of this panel 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\" Kazim Beceren, president of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation, told the BBC.",
      "The death toll is also extremely high, which raises further questions.",
      "\"There will always be fires, but we would not expect so many people to die in this type of building,\" said Prof Sevket Ozgur Atayilmaz, head of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Yildiz Technical University, who has worked on fire safety planning.",
      "\"If the structure is designed correctly for fire, if there are escape routes, and if the smoke is evacuated correctly, it is possible to overcome the fire without loss of life.\"",
      "The interior minister said there were two fire escapes, but there are indications they were not of a good standard.",
      "Were fire safety measures in place?",
      "An official from the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (TMMOB) in Bolu, Erol Percin, said the way the fire had spread suggested that fire warning, detection and extinguishing systems might not have been present.",
      "He said the building's exterior wooden facade should have been 100% fire-resistant, but that did not appear to be the case.",
      "The head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation told the BBC that the size of the fire suggested that \"the fire system either does not exist or was not designed in accordance with the standards\".",
      "There were 238 people staying in the Grand Kartal Hotel at the time.",
      "Kazim Beceren said fire safety systems were designed with the aim of taking three minutes to evacuate each floor - and a facility with more than 200 people could be evacuated in 15 to 30 minutes under ideal conditions.",
      "When an alarm goes off, the person in charge of the fire control dashboard is expected to check the location, according to the head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation.",
      "If there is no indication of a false alarm or if a second detector sends a warning, fire alarms are then normally activated throughout the building.",
      "In a properly installed system, people are then directed by announcement to the nearest fire exits, with flashing lights for people who are hearing-impaired or audible warnings for those sleeping.",
      "As fires can spread very quickly, sprinkler systems are seen as highly important for intervention at an early stage.",
      "So too is a back-up power source. According to fire protection regulations, signs pointing to emergency exits and lights showing the paths to these exits have to work for one to three hours, even if there is a power outage.",
      "The engineers' and architects' union in Bolu said in a statement that \"an automatic sprinkler system is mandatory\" in buildings of this size.",
      "\"The photos on the hotel's website show that the automatic sprinkler system, which was supposed to be installed in 2008, was not installed. Because of this failure, the fire spread rapidly and there were casualties.\"",
      "BBC Turkish has not been able to independently confirm the allegations about either the wooden cladding on the building or the hotel's fire extinguishing system.",
      "Who checked the hotel's fire safety?",
      "One of the big questions is whether the hotel's fire systems were properly inspected.",
      "Bolu Mayor Tanju Ozcan said the ministry of tourism was responsible as the hotel was beyond the boundary of his town. Erol Percin agreed.",
      "The mayor said that the last time Bolu's municipality had given a report stating the hotel was fireproof was in 2007, and there had been no such checks since then.",
      "However, Culture and Tourism Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the hotel did have a fire competence certificate \"issued by the fire department\" and inspections were down to them.",
      "There have also been calls for relatively old structures to come under scrutiny because of changing legislation.",
      "\"Places should stop operating if they  do not comply with current standards, in crowded places such as hotels, residences, nursing homes or kindergartens,\" says Prof Atayilmaz of Yildiz Technical University."

    "summary": "The US president says the US should \"take back\" the famous waterway because China runs it now.",
    "story": [
      "During his inaugural address, President Donald Trump doubled down on his assertion that China runs the Panama Canal.",
      "\"China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back,\" he said.",
      "The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "Up to 14,000 ships use it each year as a shortcut to a journey which, before the canal was built, would have taken them on a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America.",
      "What has Trump said about the canal?",
      "The mention of Panama in his inaugural speech is not the first time he has focused on the Central American nation and its transoceanic canal.",
      "On Christmas Day, Trump posted on social media that the \"wonderful soldiers of China\" were \"lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal\" - a claim which was swiftly denied by officials in Panama City and Beijing.",
      "At the time, Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino described the claim as \"nonsense\", stressing that there was \"absolutely no Chinese interference\" in the canal.",
      "Trump has also threatened to take the canal back by force, citing \"exorbitant\" fees being allegedly charged for US vessels to pass through it - another claim rejected by Panamanian authorities.",
      "Following Trump's inauguration address, President Mulino again stressed that there was \"no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration\" of the Panama Canal.",
      "The strategic waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government, not Chinese soldiers.",
      "However, Mr Trump's inaccurate claim reflects the concerns of some US officials over China's significant investments in the canal and its surrounding infrastructure.",
      "What is the history of Panama Canal?",
      "Historically, the US played a pivotal role in the construction and administration of the passage, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "After a failed attempt by the French to build it, the US secured the rights to undertake the project. The canal's construction was completed in 1914.",
      "It remained under US control until 1977, when then President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty to gradually hand it over to Panama, which Trump has referred to as \"foolish\".",
      "Since 1999, the Panama Canal Authority has held exclusive control over the operations of the waterway.",
      "The treaties signed by both the US and Panama stipulated that it shall remain permanently neutral, but the US reserves the right to defend any threat to the canal's neutrality using military force under this deal.",
      "What is China's role in the operations of the canal?",
      "There is no public evidence to suggest that the Chinese government exercises control over the canal, or its military. However, Chinese companies have a significant presence there.",
      "From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the Panama Canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.",
      "In recent years, China has also invested heavily in ports and terminals near the canal.",
      "Two of the\u202ffive ports\u202fadjacent to the canal, Balboa and Crist\u00f3bal, which sit on the Pacific and Atlantic sides respectively, have been operated by a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings since 1997.",
      "The company is a subsidiary of the publicly listed CK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate founded by Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing.",
      "It has port operations\u202fin 24 countries, including the UK.",
      "Although it is not state-owned by China, says Ryan Berg, director of the  Americas Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, there have been concerns in Washington over how much control Beijing would be able to exert over the company.",
      "A wealth of potentially useful strategic information on ships passing through the waterway flows through these ports.",
      "\"There is an increasing geopolitical tension of economic nature between the US and China,\" Mr Berg says. \"That kind of information regarding cargo would be very useful in the event of a supply chain war.\"",
      "CK Hutchison did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "The bids to operate those ports faced almost no competition, according to Andrew Thomas, a professor at the University of Akron who has written a book on the canal. \"The US at the time didn't really care about these ports and Hutchison faced no objection,\" he says.",
      "Chinese companies, both private and state-owned, have also strengthened their presence in Panama through billions of dollars in investments, including a cruise terminal and a bridge to be built over the canal.",
      "This \"package of Chinese activities\", as described by Mr Thomas, might have prompted Trump's assertion that the canal is \"owned\" by China, but operation of those ports does not equate to ownership, he stresses.",
      "Beijing has repeatedly said that China's ties with Latin America are characterised by \"equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and benefits for the people\".",
      "What are China's broader interests in Panama?",
      "Panama's strategic location means China has been vying to increase its influence in the country for years and expand its footprint on a continent that has traditionally been considered the \"backyard\" of the US.",
      "In 2017, Panama broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established formal relations with China \u2013 a huge win for Chinese diplomacy.",
      "Months later, Panama became the first Latin American country to join China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a trillion-dollar global infrastructure and investment initiative.",
      "The Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras followed suit and also severed ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing.",

      "\"He told my daughter he would rape her younger sister if she spoke about what he did to her,\" Layla says.",
      "She speaks in hushed tones fearing the family will be evicted if their landlady hears about the threats.",
      "Layla says they are now trapped in Libya: they have no money left to pay traffickers to leave and cannot return to war-torn Sudan.",
      "\"We have barely any food,\" she says, adding that her children are not in school. \"My son is afraid to leave the house as other children often beat him and insult him for being black. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.\"",
      "Millions have fled Sudan since the war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in 2023. The two sides had jointly staged a coup in 2021, but a power struggle between their commanders plunged the country into civil war.",

      "The UN refugee agency says more than 210,000 Sudanese refugees are now in Libya.",
      "The BBC has spoken to five Sudanese families who initially went to Egypt, where they said they experienced racism and violence, before moving to Libya, believing it would be safer with better job opportunities. We contacted them through a researcher in migration and asylum seeker issues in Libya.",
      "Salma tells the BBC she was already living in Cairo, in Egypt, with her husband and three children when the Sudanese civil war broke out, but as huge numbers of refugees entered the country, conditions for migrants there worsened.",
      "They decided to move to Libya, but what was awaiting them there was a \"living hell\", Salma says.",
      "She describes how, as soon as they crossed the border, they were placed in a warehouse run by traffickers. The men wanted money that had been paid in advance to traffickers on the Egyptian side of the border, but it never arrived.",
      "Her family spent nearly two months in the warehouse. At one point, Salma was separated from her husband and taken to a room for women and children. Here, she says she and her two eldest children were subjected to various forms of brutality because they wanted the money.",
      "\"Their whips left marks on our bodies. They would beat my daughter and put my son's hands in a lit oven while I was watching.",
      "\"Sometimes I wished we would all die together. I could think of no other way out.\"",
      "Salma says her son and daughter were traumatised by the experience and have suffered from incontinence since. She then lowers her voice.",
      "\"They would take me to a separate room, the 'rape room' with different men each time,\" she says. \"I bear the child of one of them.\"",
      "Eventually, she raised some money through a friend in Egypt and the traffickers released the family.",
      "She says a doctor then told her it was too late for an abortion, and when her husband found out she was pregnant he abandoned her and the children, leaving them to sleep rough, eating leftovers from rubbish bins and begging in the street.",
      "They found refuge on a remote farm in north-western Libya for a while, spending whole days with little to no food. They quenched their thirst by drinking contaminated water from a nearby well.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to hear my [older] son saying he is literally dying from hunger,\" Salma says over the phone, as the cries of her baby grow louder in the background.",
      "\"He is so hungry,\" she says, \"but I have nothing, not even enough milk in my breasts to feed him.\"",
      "Jamila, a Sudanese woman in her mid-40s, also believed reports within the Sudanese community that a better life awaited them in Libya.",
      "She fled previous unrest in Sudan's western region of Darfur in 2014 and spent years in Egypt before moving to Libya in late 2023. She says her daughters have been raped repeatedly since then - they were 19 and 20 when it first happened.",
      "\"I sent them for a cleaning job while I was ill; they came back at night covered with dirt and blood - four men raped them until one of them fainted,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Jamila says she was also raped and held captive for weeks by a man, much younger than her, who had offered her a job cleaning his house.",
      "\"He used to call me a 'disgusting black'. He raped me and said, 'This is what women were made for,'\" she recalls.",
      "\"Even kids here are mean to us, they treat us as beasts and sorcerers, they insult us for being black and African, are they not Africans themselves?\" Jamila says.",
      "When her daughters were raped the first time, Jamila took them to hospital and reported it to police. But when the police officer realised they were refugees, Jamila says he withdrew the report and warned her that she would be jailed if the complaint was officially filed. This was in the west of Libya.",
      "Libya is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 protocol relating to the Status of Refugees - and considers refugees and asylum-seekers \"illegal migrants\".",
      "The country is divided into two, with each part run by a different government, but the situation is easier for migrants in the east as they can file official complaints without being detained, and access healthcare more easily, according to human rights group Libya Crimes Watch.",
      "While sexual violence is common within unofficial facilities run by traffickers, there is also evidence that abuse is happening in official detention centres in Libya, especially in the west.",
      "Hanaa, a Sudanese woman who works gathering plastic bottles from bins to feed her children, says she was abducted in western Libya and taken to a forest and raped at gunpoint by a group of men.",
      "The next day her attackers took her to a facility run by the state-funded Stability Support Authority (SSA). Nobody told Hanaa why she had been detained.",
      "\"Young men and boys were beaten and forced to completely remove their clothes while I was watching,\" Hanaa tells the BBC.",
      "\"I was there for days. I slept on the bare floor, resting my head on my plastic slippers. They would let me go to the toilet after hours of begging. I was repeatedly beaten on the head.\"",
      "There have been numerous previous reports of migrants from other African countries being abused in Libya. The country is a key stepping stone on the way to Europe, although none of the women the BBC spoke to planned to travel there.",
      "In 2022, Amnesty International accused the SSA of \"unlawful killings, arbitrary detentions, interception and subsequent arbitrary detention of migrants and refugees, torture, forced labour, and other shocking human rights violations and crimes under international law\".",

    "title": "'A long fight full of tears': Why Thailand became a haven for LGBT couples",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 03:09:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Thailand is set to legalise same-sex marriage - one of the few places in Asia to do so. Why is it an outlier?",
    "story": [
      "\"It has been a long fight full of tears for us.\"",
      "That is how Ann \"Waaddao\" Chumaporn describes the years that led to this moment \u2013 when hundreds of couples are tying the knot as Thailand legalises same-sex marriage.",
      "And the same question which has been heard throughout the long campaign to get the equal marriage law passed is being asked again: why Thailand? Why nowhere else, aside from Taiwan and Nepal, in Asia?",
      "People think they know the answer. Thailand is famously open to and accepting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. They have long been visible in all walks of life. Thai people are easy-going about pretty much everything. \"Mai pen rai\" \u2013 no big deal \u2013 is a national catch-phrase. Buddhist beliefs, followed by more than 90% of Thais, don't forbid LGBT lifestyles. Surely, then, equal marriage was inevitable.",
      "Except it wasn't. \"It was not easy,\" says Ms Waaddao, who organises Bangkok Pride March.",
      "The first Pride march in Thailand took place only 25 years ago. Back then it was hard to get approval from the police, and the march was a chaotic, unfocused event. After 2006 only two marches took place until 2022. In 2009 one planned Pride march in Chiang Mai had to be abandoned because of the threat of violence.",
      "\"We were not accepted, by our own families and by society,\" Ms Waaddao adds. \"There were times when we did not think marriage equality would ever happen, but we never gave up.\"",
      "'We did not fight, we negotiated'",
      "For all of Thailand's general tolerance of LGBT people, getting equal rights, including marriage, required a determined campaign to change attitudes in Thai officialdom and society. And attitudes have changed.",
      "When Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira started dating his partner in 2001, they were both actors playing leading roles in TV series. At that time homosexuality was still officially described by the Thai Ministry of Health as a mental illness.",
      "Are you in a same sex relationship in Thailand? Get in touch.",
      "Marriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples",
      "Why legalising gay sex in India is not a Western idea",
      "\"Back then society could not accept leading male roles being played by a gay man. There was lots of gossip about us in the media, much of it untrue, which really stressed us,\" Mr Chakkrit recalls.",
      "\"We decided then that if we were going to date each other, we had to leave showbiz.\"",
      "They are still together but they have stayed out of the limelight for more than 20 years, running a successful production company.",
      "A lot has changed in that time \u2013 and their industry gets some credit for that.",
      "The way LGBT characters are portrayed in Thai TV dramas, from comical oddities to mainstream roles, made a big difference, according to Tinnaphop Sinsomboonthong, an assistant professor at Thammasat University who self-identifies as queer.",
      "\"Nowadays they represent us as normal characters, like you see in real life,\" he says. \"The kind of LGBTQ+ colleague you might have in the office, or your LGBTQ+ neighbour.  This really helped change perceptions and values in all generations.\"",
      "The so-called Boy Love dramas have helped bring the rest of society round to the idea of not just tolerance, but full acceptance and equal rights for the community.",
      "These romantic television dramas featuring love affairs between beautiful young men have grown enormously in popularity over the past decade, especially during the Covid pandemic.",
      "They are now one of Thailand's most successful cultural exports, with huge audiences in places like China. Series like My School President and Love Sick have got hundreds of millions of views on streaming networks.",
      "At the same time, activists became more focused and united in their bid to get the law changed. The many different LGBT groups came together in the Change 1448 campaign \u2013 1448 is the clause in the Thai Civil Code covering the definition of marriage \u2013 and later under the Rainbow Coalition for Marriage Equality.",
      "They linked up with other groups fighting for greater rights and freedoms in Thailand, and they learned to work with political parties in parliament to persuade them to change their stance on the law.",
      "The resumption of Pride marches in 2022, and getting the government to recognise and promote the appeal of Thailand as an attractive destination for LGBT travellers also helped change public perceptions.",
      "\"We did not fight, we negotiated,\" Mr Tinnaphop says. \"We knew we had to talk to Thai society, and little by little, we shifted attitudes.\"",
      "The right political moment",
      "Getting the equal marriage law through parliament was also helped by political developments in Thailand.",
      "For five years following a coup in 2014, the country was ruled by a conservative military government, which was willing only to consider recognising civil partnerships for LGBT couples, without full rights like inheritance.",
      "But in the 2019 election which returned Thailand to civilian rule, a new, youthful reformist party called Future Forward, which fully supported equal marriage, did unexpectedly well. They won the third-largest share of seats, revealing a growing hunger for change in Thailand.",
      "When a year later Future Forward was dissolved by a controversial court verdict, it set off months of student-led protests calling for sweeping reforms, including curbs to the monarchy's power.",
      "LGBT campaigners were prominent in those protests, giving them greater national prominence. The protests eventually died down, with many of the leaders arrested for questioning the monarchy's role.",
      "But in the 2023 election the successor to Future Forward, calling itself Move Forward, performed even better than in 2019, winning more seats than any other party. Again, it was clear that the desire for change was felt across Thai people of all ages.",
      "Move Forward was blocked from forming a government by conservatives who objected to its call for wholesale political reforms.",
      "But by this time, equal marriage was less contentious. Few opposed it. And passing it gave the unwieldy and unpopular coalition government which had been formed without Move Forward a quick accomplishment with which to please most of the country.",
      "Pioneering move may boost tourism",
      "Thailand, though, is an outlier in Asia. Few other countries in the region are likely to follow suit.",
      "The influence of Islam in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei makes the notion of equal marriage a non-starter. LGBT communities there face discrimination and prosecution; in Brunei sex between men carries the death penalty.",
      "In the Philippines, there is growing acceptance of LGBT couples living together openly. But the Roman Catholic Church vehemently opposes same-sex marriage.",
      "In Vietnam, like Thailand, there are no religious or ideological obstacles, but campaigning to change the law, as happened in Thailand, is difficult under a repressive regime. Much the same is true in China. Until the ruling communist party endorses equal marriage, which it shows no signs of doing, it cannot happen.",
      "Even in democracies like Japan and South Korea \u2013 where political parties are largely conservative and dominated by older men - the prospects look bleak.",
      "\"It is largely conservative Christians who are blocking it,\" says Chae-yoon Han, executive director of the Beyond the Rainbow Foundation in South Korea.",
      "\"Most, if not all, politicians in the conservative party of President Yoon are devout Christians, and they have framed marriage equality as a 'leftist agenda', which could potentially open society to a 'leftist, communist takeover'.\"",
      "India appeared close to legalising same-sex marriage in 2023, when the decision fell to its Supreme Court - but the judges declined, saying it was up to parliament.",
      "So Thailand hopes to benefit from being a pioneer. Tourism is one of the few areas of the Thai economy doing well in the post-pandemic recovery, and the country is seen as a safe and welcoming destination for LGBT holiday-makers.",
      "Growing numbers of same-sex couples from other Asian countries are choosing to live here now.",
      "The legal recognition they can get for their marriages will allow them to raise children and grow old together with nearly all the rights and protections given to heterosexual couples.",

      "If you know Guttenberg, you know he's a helper. Seven years ago, he put everything on hold to care for someone with whom he was deeply in love: his father.",
      "I noted, \"I'm gonna try to get through this interview without crying because I lost my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg asked, \"What was your dad's name?\"",
      "\"Douglas.\"",

      "\"My dad was the greatest,\" he said. \"He was the first man who ever held me, first guy I ever looked in his eyes. And I fell in love with my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg has written a book about his journey as a caregiver for the man he calls his hero. It's called \"Time to Thank.\" \"My dad and his dad weren't close,\" he said. \"My grandfather was cold. He wasn't a kissing, hugging type of dad to my father. So, my dad was the opposite.\"",
      "A \"kissing and hugging dad\" who worked jobs that weren't exactly touchy-feely. \"He was an Airborne Army Ranger. He was a New York City policeman. He was a power lifter and a weightlifter. And he did handstands for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Guttenberg's dad was a hands-on parent, so it was to Steve's surprise that when he wanted to move to L.A., at only 17, to try to become a movie star, he was allowed to do it. \"My parents gave me $300 and said, 'You got two weeks.' And I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. And my parents let me stay another two weeks. And I got a little movie [\"The Chicken Chronicles\"]. And I got more commercials. Then, I actually stayed a year, before I quit and went back to school.\"",
      "He wasn't in school for long when Hollywood beckoned him back. \"I was at a party in my suite at Albany State, and got this call from my agent. Everybody was a little \u2026 inebriated!\" he laughed. \"And my agent said, 'I got an audition for you. It was called \"Boys From Brazil.\" And it was gonna be starring Greg Peck and Larry Olivier and James Mason, Uta Hagen.'\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that down, right?\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! I asked my dad. My dad said, 'You know, just go down and do the audition. if you get it, you'll decide. And I got the job.\"",
      "Guttenberg says it was Laurence Olivier who taught him humility, but it was his dad who helped him get his big break in a little film about a bunch of misfits joining the police force. \"I told my dad that I had a screen test coming up for this movie, 'Police Academy.' And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",

      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

    "title": "Tamara de Lempicka's vibrant life and art",
    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:26:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A giant of early 20th century art, whose glamorous figurative paintings of women played an important role in defining Art Deco, is now the subject of her first-ever U.S. retrospective, currently at the de Young Museum of San Francisco.",
    "story": [
      "When you see a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, it's hard to resist leaning in for a closer look. \"It's just exquisite,\" said Furio Rinaldi, one of the curators of the first-ever Lempicka retrospective in the United States. \"You don't see the brush strokes. They are just polished and incredibly deliberate. It's such a clean way of painting.\"",
      "These glamorous Art Deco works are now on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. [The exhibit travels to Houston this spring.]",
      "So, what makes a painting so characteristically Lempicka?",
      "\"Geometrical shapes,\" said Rinaldi. \"Everything is reduced to essential forms. And the other aspect of Lempicka is that she sourced directly from examples provided by the European Old Masters. So, all these things blended together create a language that not only is entirely unique, but entirely modern.\"",
      "Born in 1894 in Poland as Tamara Rosa Hurwitz, Tamara eventually moved to St. Petersburg, marrying an aristocratic lawyer, Tadeusz \u0141empicki Junosza. In 1917, the Russian Revolution forced the couple and their young daughter to flee to Paris. \"Paris was just recovering from the end of the first war,\" said Rinaldi. \"And there was a sense of hope for the future, and kind of a great faith for what was to come.\"",
      "In Paris, she began to paint, first out of financial necessity, using the name Lempicka.",
      "Rinaldi said, \"She captured that very exciting moment of empowerment and emancipation for the queer community in Paris.\"",
      "Some of the women she painted were her lovers. \"The female body is not concealed or corseted as it was before in the previous decade,\" said Rinaldi. \"It's celebrated in its shape.\"",
      "He described a painting of her lover, the poet Ira Perrot: \"Eroticism with a sitter who's not even looking at us. She's just living in her own world. She has this gaze that is detached and completely cool.\"",
      "Each time Lempicka sold a painting, she made a purchase of her own: a diamond bracelet. According to Marisa de Lempicka, the artist's great-granddaughter, it was for protection: \"If she ever had to flee again, she could carry the bracelets with her. She could survive again.\"",
      "\"She always had to think about saving herself?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, herself and her family.\"",
      "Indeed, her fears were well-founded. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her second husband, a Jewish baron, fled Europe for the United States. She continued painting another four decades, until her death in 1980.",
      "Asked if her great-grandmother had a sense of her legacy at the end of her life, Marisa de Lempicka replied, \"She was the toast of the town in the Twenties and Thirties in Paris. She was extremely well-known. And then, she moved to the United States and, you know, the tastes changed. Abstract expressionism is in fashion, so she kind of falls out of favor.\"",
      "\"Why do you think we haven't known her name and her story?\"",
      "\"I think the fact she's a woman artist,\" Marisa said. \"How many women artists can we name? You go to the general public? Very, very few.\"",
      "But Lempicka is now back in the public eye. Last year, she was the subject of a Broadway show, and her works continue to sell for millions of dollars. Collectors include Barbra Streisand and Madonna, who's even featured Lempicka's paintings in music videos.",
      "Asked what she wants the public to know about Tamara de Lempicka, Marisa replied, \"I hope people see her art, learn about her life, and feel empowered and inspired to live their own life and their own dreams. I know this is what Tamara would have wanted.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than two years after recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally, Google-owned Fitbit will pay a $12.2 million penalty for failing to alert consumers that the products can overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday.",
      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",
      "Fitbit discontinued production of its Ionic model, which was used to track activity, heart rate and sleep, in 2020.",
      "\"Customer safety continues to be our top priority, and we're pleased to resolve this matter with the CPSC stemming from the 2022 voluntary recall of Fitbit Ionic,\" said a spokesperson for Google, which purchased\u00a0Fitbit for $2.1 billion\u00a0in 2019.",
      "About 1 million of the recalled smartwatches were sold in the U.S. at retailers including Best Buy, Kohl's and Target, as well as online at Amazon.com and Fitbit.com from September 2017 through December 2021. The products retailed for between $200 and $330 each. Another 693,000 were sold internationally, according to the company.",

      "In addition to the $12.25 million civil penalty, the settlement agreement requires Fitbit to maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Act.

    "story": [
      "More than a dozen cats have been killed or sickened by bird flu that is spreading in raw food products, the Food and Drug Administration says, prompting a federal probe into how the virus got into the pet food supply chain.",
      "\"The FDA is aware of reports of death or illness associated with uncooked food in 13 domestic cats in eight households, 1 exotic cat in one household, and an unknown number of animals at two sanctuaries for large felids,\" an FDA official said in a statement.",
      "Cases have been in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state, the FDA said.",
      "Investigators are now working to trace back the outbreaks, the official said. Testing is underway but could take several weeks to yield results to pin down the source.",
      "It is unclear how the virus spread into pet food. Taxpayers have funded record numbers of poultry being culled in an effort to stem\u00a0bird flu outbreaks, and U.S. officials said this month that farmers are not allowed to use meat from those birds in pet food.",
      "\"Affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA's efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all. They are most frequently composted on site, as part of the efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus,\" Eric Deeble, Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, told reporters last week.",
      "While bird flu has largely spared many of the humans and cows sickened by this past year's outbreaks in the U.S. from death or severe disease, officials have warned that the virus is especially lethal to cats.",
      "In response, the FDA said Friday it would order manufacturers of uncooked cat and dog foods to take steps to curb further spread.",
      "Potential risks of raw pet food",
      "Raw and minimally processed pet foods make up a minority of U.S. pet food sales, but the consulting firm OC&C said\u00a0last year\u00a0that there's been \"rapid growth\" in the market.",
      "The American Animal Hospital Association says it does not endorse feeding pets raw protein food. The group warns that \"overwhelming scientific evidence\" shows it puts animals and the humans around them at risk of disease.",
      "To comply with the new requirements, producers either need to start cooking their products or come up with another way to cut the risk in their food safety plans.",
      "\"As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to significantly minimize or prevent H5N1 transmission through animal food,\" the agency said.",
      "The move also prompted the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to step up oversight of turkey slaughter, after a bird flu strain detected in raw pet food and an infected cat was linked to a turkey flock.",
      "Under the program, APHIS said it would require turkeys to undergo isolation and extra testing in some states before they could be slaughtered.",
      "Health officials in California last year had warned against feeding pets recalled raw milk and a local raw pet food brand, Monarch Raw Pet Food, after a probe of cat deaths. Monarch has disputed the allegation, saying there is \"no credible evidence\" that their products were to blame.",
      "Oregon's agriculture department also warned of an outbreak last year also linked to raw turkey pet food by Northwest Naturals, which had been sold in a dozen states and Canada. Officials in Oregon confirmed to CBS News this month that the FDA had taken over the investigation.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks in poultry and dairy herds",
      "U.S. officials and farmers have braced in recent winters for an uptick in outbreaks, as migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south from Canada.",
      "This winter's migration started around a month later than usual, U.S. officials say, delaying when the surge of bird flu began to hit farmers hard.",
      "\"Apparently it was a very seasonally warm fall and early winter further north, and so that kept a lot of those birds up co-mingling with each other further north, before they started the fall migration,\" said Alex Turner, the USDA's national incident coordinator for the outbreak.",
      "Turner said they expect that could lead to the surge in bird flu subsiding a month later, as the amount of virus lingering in the environment from their migration starts to wind down.",
      "\"Now that they are predominantly kind of where they're going to be for the winter, there's a little bit less of that migratory movement and exposure,\" said Turner.",
      "This is on top of ongoing outbreaks from a different strain that spilled over into dairy herds in 2023. That virus has spread back from cows to birds at nearby poultry farms in some cases.",
      "That may be what happened in Northwest Naturals. Oregon's agriculture department said the strain in the turkey product was B3.13, the same as the bird flu virus fueling the dairy outbreaks.",

    "story": [
      "Whether it's a busted refrigerator, car trouble or medical issues, unexpected costs are a part of life. But even such routine curveballs often spell serious financial trouble for many Americans.",
      "That's according to a new Bankrate report that surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults about their ability to handle a surprise bill. Despite the country's current\u00a0low unemployment rate, the annual study found that 59% of Americans in 2025 don't have enough savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense.",
      "\"We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,\" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. \"Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation, the impacts of which are still being felt.\"",
      "A key issue in the 2024 presidential election, inflation and the rising\u00a0cost of everyday items\u00a0continues to impact Americans. Grocery inflation during the height of the coronavirus epidemic reached a\u00a0peak of 13.5% in 2022, while the overall rate of inflation for all products and services topped out at 9.1%.",
      "Although inflation has cooled to an annual rate of 2.9% as of December, prices for food, shelter and many other items remain elevated. Consumers also have found that many common products, from snacks to paper towels, have gotten smaller, a retailing tactic\u00a0known as \"shrinkflation\u00a0aimed at cutting a manufacturer's costs.",
      "In his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, President Trump said he would direct his cabinet \"to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\"",
      "Whether the Trump administration can engineer such a feat remains to be seen, while polls suggest that many Americans are skeptical that prices will return to earth. Economists also warn that Mr. Trump's policies, which could include steep new tariffs on U.S. imports and the deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary.",
      "Younger Americans worry most",
      "To be sure, the meteoric rise in the cost of food, housing and health care over the past several years has made it hard for many households to make ends meet, let alone save money. Bankrate's survey shows that 73% of Americans said they're saving less for unexpected expenses, compared with 68% in 2024.",
      "\"Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings,\" according to the Bankrate report.",
      "Younger Americans tend to have the strongest concerns about their savings. A whopping 80% of Gen Zers worry about being able to cover immediate expenses if they were to suddenly lose their primary source of income, compared with 72% for Millennials and Gen Xers. Some 58% of Baby Boomers say they regularly fret about having enough money put away, a particular concern given that many are already retired.",
      "Borrower nation",
      "Only 41% of Americans said they would be able to tap their savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to Bankrate's report. That's down 3% from 2024 and the lowest the percentage since 2021 (39%)",
      "Another 25% said they would use a credit card to pay for a $1,000 bill, 13% said they would turn to a family member for the money and 5% said they would take out a personal loan. In total, about 43% of respondents told Bankrate they would have to borrow money to pay for an emergency expense of $1,000.",
      "That's a concern given consumers collectively owe a record $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0show. Meanwhile, credit card rates continue to soar, hovering round 24%.",
      "\"The cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\" Hamrick said. \"They are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\"",
      "Another 13% of Americans said they would pay for a surprise $1,000 debt by curbing their spending, On a positive note, while 36% of adults said their credit card debt exceeded what they had in emergency savings, Bankrate found that more than half of survey respondents, at 55%, had more emergency savings in 2024 than credit card debt. That's the highest percentage since 2018.",
      "Asked how much they have in emergency savings, 28% of respondents said they had enough to cover six months of expenses; 16% said they had enough to cover three to five months; 29% had enough to cover less than three months' worth of bills; and 27% said they had no emergency savings at all.",
      "Tips for saving now",
      "For people who consider themselves among the roughly one-third of Americans who want to reduce their debt and boost their emergency savings in 2025, Bankrate offers three tips:",
      "Calculate how much you need to save.\u00a0As a general target, experts recommend saving three to six months' worth of expenses in case of emergencies. To figure out how much to put away, add the total amount you spend each month on food, housing, gas and other bills. So if your monthly bills amount to $2,000 a month, you'll need $6,000 in savings to stay afloat in case of an emergency, such as a job loss.",
      "Open a savings account just for emergencies.\u00a0Opening an online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can help you save for unexpected emergencies.",

      "In March 2022, the Federal Reserve started raising the federal funds rate, with banks following suit by hiking rates for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. But those increases were not matched with high interest rate payouts on savings accounts at banks including Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, according to the lawmakers.",

    "story": [
      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous Purdue bankruptcy settlement was struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2024. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions of dollars that would have gone to victims was stuck, and we had to go back to square one,\" said Cheryl Juaire, a mother who lost two sons to opioid addiction, at a press conference with James announcing the settlement.",
      "\"Three and a half years ago, in the midst of this case, I lost my second son Sean, also to an overdose. I buried him in the midst of an ongoing mediation,\" she said. \"I truly hope that no one ever has to feel the devastation I have felt in losing two of my three children.\"",
      "Juaire noted that the new deal is \"even more than the original deal\" but emphasized that \"this will only happen if the parties that stood in the way the last time will not do so again.\"",
      "James has secured up to $250 million for New York from the settlement to support opioid treatment and recovery programs. She negotiated the settlement along with attorney generals from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.",

      "More than two years after recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally, Google-owned Fitbit will pay a $12.2 million penalty for failing to alert consumers that the products can overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday.",
      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",
      "Fitbit discontinued production of its Ionic model, which was used to track activity, heart rate and sleep, in 2020.",

      "About 1 million of the recalled smartwatches were sold in the U.S. at retailers including Best Buy, Kohl's and Target, as well as online at Amazon.com and Fitbit.com from September 2017 through December 2021. The products retailed for between $200 and $330 each. Another 693,000 were sold internationally, according to the company.",

      "In addition to the $12.25 million civil penalty, the settlement agreement requires Fitbit to maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Act. The company also agreed to submit an annual report regarding its compliance program and internal controls, the CPSC stated.",

      "Mr. Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said.",
      "The readout didn't elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which were the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports, as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump's call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first such call to be reported.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Mr. Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017.",
      "\"The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Mr. Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \"If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 - we'll up it for all the inflation - I think I'd probably go.\"",
      "The 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom.",
      "Mr. Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",
      "The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues.",
      "Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia's western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars' worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",

    "story": [
      "In one of his first acts after returning to the Oval Office this week, President Trump tasked federal agencies with developing ways to potentially ease prices for U.S. consumers. But experts warn that his administration's crackdown on immigration could both drive up inflation as well as hurt a range of businesses by shrinking the nation's workforce.",
      "\"A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages, which has different sector implications including inflationary pressure, especially for food prices,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said labor shortages stemming from the Trump administration's push to remove undocumented immigrants could curtail the production of some products and services.",
      "\"Ultimately, the main way immigration affects inflation is that if jobs are left open and production is unable to keep up with demand, that's going to lead to higher prices,\" he said.",
      "What sectors depend most on immigrant labor?",
      "According to\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies of New York and other groups, roughly 8.3 million undocumented immigrants work in the U.S, or just over 5% of the country's workforce.",
      "Undocumented immigrants account for about 20% of the agriculture industry's overall workforce, although that figure can rise to roughly half for some speciality farms, according to Capital Economics, which advises large investors.",
      "\"It's the key sector that comes up time and time again,\" Brown said, noting that harvesting delicate fruit is more labor-intensive than, for example, growing cereal crops. That means mass deportations could lead to price hikes in the fruit aisle.",
      "\"The inflationary impact could affect food overall, but particularly fresher fruits, rather than the ingredients in more processed foods,\" he said.",
      "Construction companies, including businesses focused on home renovations and landscaping, have the next highest share of undocumented workers and would also likely face a labor shortage if the government clamps down.",
      "\"With regard to home improvement projects those prices, they might become unaffordable to the point where people feel they can't do them anymore. And the lack of supply will be a big issue there, too,\" Brown said.",
      "Restaurants and food service businesses, which employ large numbers of undocumented workers, could be at particular risk if deportations flare. A shortage of workers would likely force such enterprises, including millions of small eateries around the U.S., to raise their wages to attract new employees. But that would also lead to hikes in menu prices, potentially driving away customers.",
      "\"They don't necessarily have the ability to bid up wages, so it might be that those places just shut down because they don't have the labor,\" Brown said.",
      "\"Removing large numbers of immigrants would drastically reduce the labor force, which could lead to rising wages, but potentially just higher prices for food, building and repairing homes, hotel stays and more things Americans hope to see lower prices for,\" added Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "That's because there are some jobs where even higher pay generally fails to attract U.S. born workers, like farming. \"Wages might not rise and instead we'd just see a short-term lack of availability of workers for harvesting crops,\" she said.",
      "Bier of the Cato Institute notes that removing undocumented workers could also have a ripple effect on legally employed workers. For example, the construction industry has an estimated 2 million undocumented workers, but their bosses are mostly Americans.",
      "\"A lot of immigrants do jobs that support jobs held by Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"The same thing is true in hospitality. Americans are more likely to be in management and supervisory roles, so if you pull a bunch of workers you're supervising, there will be fewer jobs for those supervisors and you'll see everyone leveling down,\" Bier added. \"The economic effects are going to be much more diffuse than people expect.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has a new target in its sights for trimming federal spending: the U.S. penny.",
      "In Tuesday X post, Musk's DOGE wrote that the U.S. spends about 3 cents to mint each penny, which, of course, is only valued at 1 cent.",
      "\"The penny costs over 3 cents to make and cost U.S. taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023,\" DOGE wrote. \"The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced.\"",
      "In pointing out the penny's costliness, DOGE is taking aim at an issue that has sparked debate for years, although the price of manufacturing the cent has only grown over the past several years. In 2016, for instance, the U.S. was spending about 1.5 cents to mint each penny, or less than half of its current manufacturing cost.",
      "Still, the cent's $179 million in costs represents mere metaphorical pennies when it comes to DOGE's mandate to cut federal spending. President Donald Trump has said DOGE will provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\" Musk has said the group will aim to trim $500 billion in annual federal spending.",

      "Federal officials have proposed suspending the penny in prior years, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew pushing the idea in 2015. Some economists have also advocated for dropping the penny from circulation, but there could be a costly downside to ditching the cent, as transactions would be rounded to 5-cent intervals, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a 2020 blog post.",
      "\"For a single item or small-value purchase, rounding up or down could represent a significant price change,\" the post noted.",
      "Other nations have ditched their equivalent of the penny, including Canada, which stopped minting its one-cent coin in 2012. One 2018 economic analysis found that Canadian consumers paid about $3.27 million in additional Canadian dollars at grocery stores each year due to prices being rounded higher after the change.",
      "\"On the other hand, there may be additional, hard-to-quantify costs to using pennies that would argue in favor of elimination. Counting pennies to make change takes time, and as the old business adage goes, time is money,\" the Richmond Fed noted.",

      "President Trump, who while campaigning vowed to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" on Monday signaled his focus on the high cost of living in the U.S. by signing an executive order that requires \"all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief\" to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order blames several factors for the pandemic-era inflation surge that has left many households feeling financially pinched, including high federal spending under the Biden administration and costs from new regulations.",
      "\"It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life,\" the executive order states.",
      "To accomplish that, Mr. Trump is ordering the departments and agencies that fall under the executive branch, including the departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Energy, to take actions that lower prices for everything from housing and health costs to food and fuel.",
      "There's a lot riding on Mr. Trump's mandate given that U.S. voters last fall consistently ranked the economy and inflation as among their top issues. But whether Mr. Trump's order will meaningfully move the needle on inflation is uncertain, some economists say.",
      "\"Trump's cost of living order fails to address the root causes of inflation, namely corporate profiteering and broken supply chains,\" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank. \"This order is a talking point, not a plan.\"",
      "Recent economic\u00a0research from the likes of Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, has found that spiking prices in 2021 and 2022 stemmed from factors such as supply-chain disruptions and increased commodity prices \u2014 forces that any president, including Mr. Trump, would struggle to control.",

      "That refers to an analysis from University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan, whose research found that the Biden administration's regulations may over time add a total of about $47,000 in added costs per household. Fuel emission rules from the Obama and Biden administrations are also forecast to boost the cost of vehicles by $6,000 each, Mulligan estimated.",
      "But eliminating federal regulations that protect workers and consumers won't lower the cost of living, Owens said. Americans have been struggling with cost-of-living issues for decades, ranging from soaring health care costs to rising housing prices \u2014 trends rooted in structural problems such as a shortage of available housing and the nation's complex for-profit health care system.",
      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:19:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "\"There have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" stated one of the executive orders signed by the president on Monday evening. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service.\"",
      "Critics view the touted-in-advance policy as an effort to topple the heart of civil service, in which people are hired based on merit and can't be arbitrarily dismissed.",

      "Kelly \u2014 whose union represents employees with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration, among other agencies \u2014 also called Mr. Trump's directives \"a blatant attempt to corrupt the federal government by eliminating employees' due process rights so they can be fired for political reasons.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:51:18 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump opted against deploying a blanket tariff against U.S. trading partners, but kept the heat on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

    "summary": "Donald and Melania Trump launched new cryptocurrencies over the weekend. Some experts are advising investors to be cautious.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

That puts the initiative in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, according to the group.",
      "FACA requires these groups to be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee,\" the lawsuit states.

      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Ramaswamy saying they aimed to cut about $500 billion in annual expenditures. The lawsuit claims that DOGE so far appears to have largely appointed three types of people to work on its efforts: tech industry executives, people affiliated with the Trump campaign and his prior administration as well as associates of Musk or Ramaswamy's.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that, as a result, DOGE is in violation of FACA because \"not a single member of DOGE is a federal employee or represents the perspective of federal employees, despite the evidence that DOGE intends to provide recommendations regarding federal employment practices and ways to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\"",
      "It also claims that DOGE is violating the law's mandate that advisory committee meetings must be open to the public, noting that Musk and Ramaswamy have held private meetings with various elected officials, as well as with tech executives.",
      "\"Nobody disputes that there is a huge amount of wasteful spending in the federal government,\" Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our only concern is that DOGE, as it is currently constituted, lacks the expertise to understand how its recommendations will backfire if it pushes federal workers out without understanding why they are there in the first place.",
      "He added, \"Government work is not corporate work, and any recommendations made without that perspective are doomed to fail.\"",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include two men who sent in applications to be hired by DOGE. One, Jerald Lentini, is an attorney for National Security Counselors, while the second, Joshua Erlich, is an attorney who frequently represents federal employees and could represent their viewpoints, the lawsuit notes. Neither has heard back from DOGE about their applications.",
      "\"Plaintiffs conclude that, upon information and belief, neither Lentini nor Erlich, nor anyone similarly situated who would represent the perspectives of federal employees (including national security employees), unions, or accountability and transparency advocates, will be selected for DOGE,\" the lawsuit claims.",

    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",

It was also assigned to determine whether those FBI efforts might have had an effect on King's assassination.

There are other former officials who continue to face a threat from Iran and are provided U.S.-taxpayer funded security by other agencies. Those individuals include former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Ret. Gen. Mark Milley and Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM Gen (Ret.) The Biden administration did not explain why it pulled protection off of former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien, who also faced threats.",

Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, objected to a time agreement that would have allowed the Senate to quickly vote on Ratcliffe's nomination, expressing \"serious concerns\" about Ratcliffe's ability to distance himself from Mr. Trump's political interests and urging that it wasn't too much to ask for senators to have time to debate the nomination on the floor.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term. At that time, Mr. Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Mr. Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",

Democrats criticized Ratcliffe for declassifying Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about members of their party during the 2016 race, intelligence that Ratcliffe acknowledged might not be true.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked President Trump's new executive order that seeks to eliminate birthright citizenship.",
      "At a hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour called Mr. Trump's order \"blatantly unconstitutional\" and said he will grant the request for a temporary restraining order sought by four Democrat-led states that challenged it: Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon.",
      "The judge's order will remain in place while legal proceedings continue and is an early blow to the unilateral efforts undertaken by Mr. Trump to crack down on immigration, which he promised to do on the campaign trail and began to pursue almost immediately after he was sworn in for a second term Monday.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said the department \"will vigorously defend President Trump's [executive order], which correctly interprets the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation's laws enforced.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that his administration will appeal the decision, but declined to respond further.",
      "Kwame Raoul, the Illinois attorney general, said the state is pleased the court blocked the president's executive order.",
      "\"The right of an individual born in this country to be a citizen of this country was enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution more than 150 years ago following the Civil War. No president has the authority to override the Constitution. Period,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The president's order targeting birthright citizenship was among a wave of executive actions he signed just after his inauguration. The order directs federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents such as passports to children born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally or under temporary visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's move was swiftly challenged by the four states and a separate group of 18 others, as well as advocacy groups.",
      "In a four-page order issued after the hearing, Coughenour wrote that the president's executive action harms the states by forcing their agencies to \"lose federal funding and incur substantial costs to provide essential and legally required medical care and social services to resident children\" subject to his measure. He found the states' residents are also harmed by \"depriving them of their constitutional right to citizenship and all the associated rights and benefits.\"",
      "Citing his four decades on the bench, Coughenour said he \"can't remember\" a case that presented a question \"as clear as this.\"",
      "Coughenour was the first judge to convene a hearing on the issue, during which he considered the request from the four states to temporarily block implementation of the order.",
      "The judge, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1991, said he would have a difficult time imagining members of the bar finding Mr. Trump's order to be constitutional.",
      "The four states argued Mr. Trump's order seeking to end birthright citizenship violates the 14th Amendment, which states that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"",
      "\"Through the order, babies being born today aren't considered American citizens anymore,\" Lane Polozola, a lawyer representing Washington state, argued during the hearing, adding that hundreds of thousands of children across the country will be impacted by Mr. Trump's action.",

    "summary": "GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski says she \"cannot in good conscience\" support Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense, and she and Sen. Susan Collins voted \"no\" on his nomination in a procedural vote.",
    "story": [
      "The nomination of Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump's pick for Defense Secretary, advanced in a procedural vote Thursday afternoon, 51-49. Both Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted \"no\" in a procedural vote on Hegseth's confirmation Thursday.",
      "Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday she is \"unable to support\" Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense, becoming the first Republican to state her opposition to President Trump's nominee ahead of his Senate confirmation vote.",
      "Collins of Maine soon followed in saying she won't vote for Hegseth, citing his views on women in combat.",
      "Murkowski had been seen on Capitol Hill as a possible \"no\" vote and had tough questions for Hegseth about his views on women in combat, about his character, and about his lack of an FBI background check.",
      "\"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook,\" Murkowsi said in a lengthy statement Thursday. \"Given the global security environment we're operating in, it is critical that we confirm a Secretary of Defense, however, I regret that I am unable to support Mr. Hegseth.\"",
      "Murkowski also expressed skepticism over Hegseth's leadership experience, saying his \"limited managerial experience involved running two small non-profit organizations that had decidedly mixed results.\"",
      "\"After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against Pete Hegseth's nomination for Secretary of Defense,\" Collins said in a statement. \"While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job.\"",
      "Hegseth fielded tough questions from Democrats over his views on\u00a0women in the military\u00a0and an\u00a0allegation of sexual assault\u00a0during his confirmation hearing. After Trump announced his nomination, reports surfaced of an alleged sexual assault, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of veterans' organizations Hegseth ran. To control the damage and prove his mettle, Hegseth barnstormed the Capitol for meetings with mostly Republican senators.",
      "Murkowski praised his military service and his advocacy for veterans but said those factors \"do not alleviate my significant concerns regarding his nomination.\"",
      "She pointed to his record in leading two veterans' organizations, stating that his leadership \"was marked with accusations of financial mismanagement and problems with the workplace culture he fostered.\"",
      "And Murkowski, noting he had \"recently revised his statements on women in combat since being nominated,\" said she is still \"concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join.\"",
      "Hegseth needs a simple majority in the Senate to be confirmed, and in the event of a tie, Vice President JD Vance can break it. He can afford to lose no more than three Republicans.",
      "Hegseth won over a key Republican, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who told an Iowa radio station soon after his confirmation hearing that he had her support.",
      "Murkowski said she's carefully reviewed Hegseth's writings and other materials and received \"substantial feedback\" from constituents, veterans and other organizations.",
      "\"After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense,\" she wrote.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 15:00:41 -0500",
    "summary": "As interest rates rose, banks charged more for credit cards and loans, but held rates paid on savings accounts.",
    "story": [
      "As interest rates climbed, major banks charged borrowers more for mortgages and auto loans, yet never increased payouts to savers, despite telling lawmakers they would do so, say two U.S. senators in letters to seven CEOs, shared exclusively with CBS News.",
      "In March 2022, the Federal Reserve started raising the federal funds rate, with banks following suit by hiking rates for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. But those increases were not matched with high interest rate payouts on savings accounts at banks including Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, according to the lawmakers.",
      "\"This tactic \u2014 charging borrowers more, paying savers a little, and pocketing interest paid by the Federal Reserve \u2014 has enabled U.S. banks to rake in record profits of $1 trillion and JPMorgan alone to make record profits of $49.6 billion in 2023,\" according to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island), the authors of the letters. Meanwhile, \"savers have struggled to keep up with inflation,\" they added.",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and his counterparts at half a dozen other financial institutions\u00a0testified\u00a0before the Senate Banking Committee in September of 2022 that their respective banks expected to increase rates for savers, albeit at a slower pace. While interest rates on the accounts JPMorgan keeps at the Fed rose from 3.15% to 4.65%, JPMorgan's customers continue to earn .01% on their savings, the lawmakers stated.",
      "\"These banks pledged in front of the United States Congress they would meaningfully pass on higher savings rates to their customers after hiking the cost of loans to pad their profits. Families across the country are struggling with inflation \u2014 these CEOs need to keep their word, not double-dip at the expense of their customers' savings,\" Warren told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "\"Experts have called megabanks' current net interest income a 'Goldilocks situation,' where banks have benefitted from higher Federal Reserve interest rates and kept deposit rates low,\" Warren and Reed noted in their letters, which called on the CEOs to explain what portion of their compensation had been based on their banks' \"interest-rate profiteering over the last two years.\"",
      "Wells Fargo declined to comment, while none of the other six banks responded to requests for comment.",

      "As California faces the largest\u00a0insurance crisis\u00a0in the state's history,\u00a0there is still no leader of the state Senate Insurance Committee.",
      "Democratic Sen. Susan Rubio was the Senate Insurance Committee chair for the past six years. As of Wednesday, that committee is the only committee in the entire legislature without a chair.",
      "Rubio, arguably the most qualified person for the role in the Senate, is embroiled in a federal corruption investigation. Meanwhile, the long-time senior committee staffer who could guide the committee in the absence of an experienced chair left the Senate last year to work for an insurance company, and half of the committee members are new.",
      "CBS News California Investigates exclusively spoke with Rubio on Friday. The senator directly addressed questions about the investigation and the open committee chair.",
      "Rubio, a Democrat from Baldwin Park, said she's \"currently not involved\" in the federal corruption investigation that has already ensnared a handful of other officials in San Bernardino County, Compton, Commerce and Baldwin Park.",
      "Federal officials have not identified Rubio by name in the case. However, no one else matches\u00a0the full description of \"Person 20,\" who is accused in recently released federal court documents of asking for $240,000 in bribes from a cannabis company and accepting $30,000 in illegal campaign contributions. The allegations stem from when Rubio was a member of the Baldwin Park City Council.",
      "\"As long as there's no real name to it and people are just speculating and talking about this as a guessing game,\" Rubio said. \"we can go many different directions, but I would just encourage people to wait for the facts.\"",
      "Rubio told CBS News California that she wasn't interested in being the insurance committee chair anymore.",
      "\"I've been chair for six years and before the [Southern California] wildfires started, I had asked for an opportunity to be on another committee,\" Rubio said.",
      "Senate President Pro Tem\u00a0Mike McGuire's office did not respond to repeated interview requests from CBS News California or to emailed questions about the vacant Insurance Chair position.",
      "McGuire is currently fundraising to run for California Insurance Commissioner when he terms out in 2026. There is speculation around the vapitl that he could appoint himself as the insurance chair. His office did not respond when we asked about that.",
      "Rubio's spokesperson, Matthew Z'berg, previously told CalMatters that Rubio \"encouraged (McGuire) to appoint a new chair to be announced with all other assignments. She also conveyed to him that by leaving the position open, he would be feeding into false narratives and speculation.\"",
      "Rubio also took a thinly veiled shot at McGuire, suggesting that he's playing politics by leaving the seat vacant due to speculation McGuire is eying a run for California Insurance Commissioner.",
      "\"Insurance issues affecting consumers across the state are of particular interest to him,\" a statement from Rubio's office said. \"It is a critical issue that he has been very vocal about in the past, and will likely continue to do so.\"",
      "In a recent statement, McGuire said \"we've been leading on consumer-focused insurance reform for years \u2014 it's personal for me because of the wildfires that have devastated the communities I represent. And this year will be no different.\"",
      "\"The Southern California fires make it all the more clear how critical this issue is. Any premise that any legislation would be delayed is unequivocally BS,\" he said. \"A committee has been formed and we will name an insurance chair in the very near future.\"",
      "The Insurance Committee is not scheduled to meet until March. Bills need to be in print for at least 30 days before legislators can act on them, so any new insurance-related legislation introduced this week wouldn't be heard until at least late February.",
      "Capitol insider and legislative rules expert Chris Michali explained that while committees won't start meeting to vote on bills for a couple of months, there is a lot to do in the meantime, even with the committee chair vacant.",
      "\"There's a tremendous amount of staff time that goes into researching and analyzing different proposals,\" Michali said. \"And (staff) can only go so far without a chair because (they) don't know what the new chairs' priorities are.\"",
      "The senior committee staff, known as the principal consultant, is also new to the committee.",
      "Senate rules require the president Pro Temp to appoint committee members based on seniority and experience, which is relative this year.",
      "Roughly a third of the legislature is newly elected, roughly a quarter have never served in state office before, and half of the insurance committee is new to that committee.",
      "When asked why she asked for a different committee assignment this year, Rubio pointed to the incoming Senate freshman class.",
      "\"The reality is that this is the largest class that came in,\" Rubio told CBS News California.",
      "Nearly 50% of California's legislature has two years of experience or less. Term limit rules have created a giant freshman and sophomore class.",
      "When it comes to experience, Sen. Rubio has been the Senate insurance chair for longer than most of the legislature has been in office.",
      "\"I continue to grow and expand, and I'm still using my expertise to sit on a committee that's going to advise and support,\" Rubio said.",
      "The recently released federal documents are a plea agreement signed by former Baldwin Park City Attorney Robert Tafoya. Federal officials released the agreement late last year. In the agreement, Tafoya says he helped facilitate bribes to local officials from companies seeking marijuana permits.",
      "The Los Angeles Times was the first news outlet to report that Rubio matched the description of \"Person 20.\" The plea agreement describes Person 20 as a public official, in a position to be able to fire the city attorney, who won a primary for state office in 2018. No other local officials match the description.",
      "The plea agreement says Person 20 sought $240,000 from a marijuana company seeking a city permit, but the company refused to pay that much so the deal fell through. Person 20 also sought and received $30,000 from Tafoya in a scheme to drum up support for Person 20's 2018 state campaign, the documents say. Tafoya said he agreed to pay Person 20, in exchange for assurance he'd keep his city job and get state work from Person 20 after the election, according to his plea agreement.",
      "Tafoya admitted to federal tax evasion and bribery charges in 2023, but prosecutors kept the plea agreement secret until last month since Tafoya had agreed to participate in the ongoing investigation.",
      "\"I have no idea who Person 20 is, but I am completely confident that the U.S. Attorney's Office would not include these declaratory statements about Person 20's actions unless they were very confident they could prove the truth of those statements in a court of law,\" said McGregor Scott, a twice-appointed former U.S. Attorney based in Sacramento.",
      "CBS News California asked Rubio directly if she was \"Person 20.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you what that person is, but all I know is that I'm not talking to anyone, and right now, that's just been speculation and innuendo,\" Rubio responded.",
      "CBS News California then asked Rubio if she denies being \"Person 20.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying that,\" she responded. \"I'm just saying that you read the report, and whatever is happening there is happening there, but I think that people would have to reach out to me in order for me to be part of any of this.\"",
      "Campaign contribution records compiled by CalMatters reveal that Robert Tafoya, the City Attorney who pleaded guilty to tax evasion and bribing \"Person 20\", donated at least $18,000 to Senator Rubio. Her campaign later returned $7,000.",
      "Rubio denied to CBS News California that she has ever taken any bribes.",
      "\"There are 120 legislators here and in the state House, and every single one of them accepts donations, contributions. That's the way the legal system is set up ... This is a system that actually the State of California set up. It's a fair political process that reviews all the contributions and you have to report it legally and everything is done through a process,\" Rubio said.",
      "Her spokesperson later added via email, \"There is no case against Senator Rubio, and there is no violation being investigated by the Senate or Assembly. All fundraising guidelines set for legislators by the FPPC were clearly followed.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles is overseeing the case. A spokesperson declined to comment about who Person 20 is or say when \u2013 or if \u2013 charges would be filed against them.",
      "Senate President Pro Tem\u00a0Mike McGuire's office told our CalMatters reporting partners that leadership is waiting for more information from federal prosecutors before making a decision about reappointing Rubio to her previous position as committee chair.",
      "\"We have requested and are awaiting additional information from the U.S. Attorney's Office before finalizing any decisions,\" McGuire's office told CalMatters in an email.",
      "Bill Essayli, a Republican Assembly member from Corona, requested the Assembly and Senate ethics committees to take up investigations after the LA Times report last month.",
      "Essayli spent about four years as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office that unsealed Tafoya's plea agreement.",
      "Essayli said he has no first-hand knowledge about this case since he left that job in 2018, but he said the allegations outlined in the plea agreement are troubling enough for the Legislature to act on its own without waiting for prosecutors. His ethics complaint also doesn't identify Rubio by name.",
      "\"When the Biden DOJ actually makes specific allegations like that against a sitting legislator, I don't think we can wait as a public body for that investigation to play out \u2013 criminal investigations can take years to develop,\" Essayli told CalMatters. \"Meanwhile, this individual is still sitting in office. They still wield power in the name of the public, and they could be engaged in the same activity.\"",
      "Erin V. Peth, the chief counsel for the Senate Ethics Committee, told CalMatters Essayli's complaint is under review but provided no other details.",
      "No woman California legislator has ever been indicted on public corruption charges while in office. Several male Assemblymembers and senators have been charged with such crimes over the years.",
      "In 2010, state charges were filed against Los Angeles County Democratic Sen. Roderick Wright for voter fraud, perjury, and other crimes stemming from him lying about actually living in his district. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown later pardoned Wright.",

      "Also in 2016, a federal judge sentenced Sen. Ron Calderon of Montebello to 42 months in federal prison for receiving over $150,000 in bribes. His brother, Assemblymember Tom Calderon, was sentenced to a year in prison for laundering his brother's bribe money.",
      "Following the Yee and Calderon indictments, voters in 2016 approved Proposition 50, which gives legislators the authority to suspend a disgraced colleague without pay. Doing so requires a two-thirds vote of the lawmaker's chamber.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 13:30:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous Purdue bankruptcy settlement was struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2024. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions of dollars that would have gone to victims was stuck, and we had to go back to square one,\" said Cheryl Juaire, a mother who lost two sons to opioid addiction, at a press conference with James announcing the settlement.",
      "\"Three and a half years ago, in the midst of this case, I lost my second son Sean, also to an overdose. I buried him in the midst of an ongoing mediation,\" she said. \"I truly hope that no one ever has to feel the devastation I have felt in losing two of my three children.\"",
      "Juaire noted that the new deal is \"even more than the original deal\" but emphasized that \"this will only happen if the parties that stood in the way the last time will not do so again.\"",
      "James has secured up to $250 million for New York from the settlement to support opioid treatment and recovery programs. She negotiated the settlement along with attorney generals from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.",
      "\"I will continue to go after the companies that caused the opioid epidemic and fight to get justice for those who have suffered,\" said James.",

In an interview that aired Wednesday on Fox News, Mr. Trump threatened to potentially withhold federal funding, blasting California's water management and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. The president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he doesn't think the federal government should give California \"anything\" until it sends more water down to the southern part of the state.",
      "\"I don't think we should give California anything until they let water flow down,\" the president told Fox News on Wednesday.",

      "Fires across the L.A. area have killed at least 28 people, destroyed more than 15,000 structures and charred some 63 square miles. The Palisades and Eaton wildfires continue to burn, and the Hughes Fire in Castaic, which broke out Wednesday, has put more than 50,000 people under evacuation orders and warnings in the northern Los Angeles County community, authorities say.",
      "Mr. Trump told NBC he wanted to visit sooner than this week, but \"thought it would be better if I went as president.\" Few details have been released about his trip so far, and Newsom's team said Wednesday that they only know about the trip from \"sources,\" according to The Associated Press.",
      "Newsom invited Mr. Trump to visit in the aftermath of the fires, and said this week he looks forward to the president's visit. Mr. Trump, who has called him \"Gavin Newscum\" on social media, has long been critical of Newsom's approach to forest and brush management in California.",
      "\"Governor Gavin Newscum should immediately go to Northern California and open up the water main, and let the water flow into his dry, starving, burning State, instead of having it go out into the Pacific Ocean,\" Trump wrote recently on his Truth Social platform. \"It ought to be done right now, NO MORE EXCUSES FROM THIS INCOMPETENT GOVERNOR.

      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Saudi Arabia's crown prince said Thursday the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Trump put a price tag on returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said.",
      "The readout didn't elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which were the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports, as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump's call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first such call to be reported.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Mr. Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017.",
      "\"The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Mr. Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \"If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 - we'll up it for all the inflation - I think I'd probably go.\"",
      "The 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom.",
      "Mr. Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",
      "The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues.",

      "Ali Alfarajalla, a Baghdad-born realtor in Dearborn, Michigan, normally votes for Democrats, but this election was a different story.",
      "\"If 50,000 Palestinians dead under the rubble isn't enough to sway me from Democratic Party, I don't know what is,\" Afarajalla said.",
      "More than half the population in Dearborn is Middle Eastern or North African. In Wayne County, which encompasses the inner-ring suburb as well as Detroit, nearly 8% of the population is Arab American \u2014 the highest percentage in the U.S.",
      "Last November, the majority voted Democrat, except at the top of the ticket. President Trump came to Dearborn\u00a0looking for votes and it worked. He won the city and took Michigan in a startling reversal for Democrats.",
      "\"The voters here were deeply unimpressed with Kamala Harris and appalled by the Biden administration,\" said Diana Abouali, director of the National Arab American Museum.",

      "Abouali says the results show how angry Dearborn was at the Biden-Harris White House, mostly over its support for Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip. The community voted for Trump, despite the president's past action in banning travel from some majority Muslim countries and worries about his proposal to deport millions of immigrants.",
      "\"For some reason they felt that Trump was the candidate for them,\" Abouali said, adding that \"like most Americans, Arab Americans have very short-term memories.\"",
      "Amer Zahr, a Palestinian standup comedian, refused to vote for Harris.",
      "When asked if he voted in anger, Zahr said, \"Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. The most important thing was them losing, so that we could make our presence known.\"",

      "\"We get it...We understand anyone who has this illusion that Donald Trump is going to bring anything good for the specific interests of our community, I think, is lying to themselves,\" Zahr said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Trump administration officials are considering deploying as many as 10,000 soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border and using Department of Defense bases to hold migrants awaiting deportation as they plan their dramatic crackdown on illegal immigration, according to an internal government memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "In an executive action Mr. Trump signed upon taking office on Monday, he declared a national emergency along the southern border and ordered the Defense Department to provide troops and resources \"to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control\" of the border. He also instructed the military to help build border barriers to repel migrants.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the president had signed another executive order to deploy 1,500 troops to the southern border, where 2,500 soldiers are already stationed under federal orders. Texas and other states have also deployed National Guard soldiers to the border in recent years, including to fortify it with razor wire.",
      "But the internal Customs and Border Protection memo dated Jan. 21 indicates there's a plan to dispatch \"~10,000 soldiers\" to help the agency's mission at the southern border. The Trump administration, according to the document, has submitted an \"[u]nrestrained request\" for the Pentagon to surge resources and personnel to assist CBP with technology and infrastructure.",
      "The memo also says the Defense Department \"may\" convert its bases into \"holding facilities,\" presumably to help CBP detain migrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally.",
      "Additionally, the memo shows the Trump administration is planning to dramatically expand detention capacity at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is expected to be at the center of Mr. Trump's promised mass deportations.",
      "According to the document, ICE officials want 14 new detention facilities with the capacity to hold up to 1,000 migrants each and another four able to accommodate as many as 10,000 immigrant detainees each.",
      "During a briefing with reporters, a senior U.S. military official said the 1,500-troop deployment would involve dispatching 1,000 Army personnel and 500 Marines, as well as helicopters, to the California and Texas border. The official said the troops would not engage in law enforcement, as federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. Instead, the official said they would be tasked with helping CBP and erecting border barriers, to curtail illegal crossings.",
      "The Department of Defense also announced it would \"provide military airlift to support\" deportation flights for more than 5,000 migrants detained along the U.S.-Mexico border by CBP. Officials said the Department of Homeland Security would offer in-flight law enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to greatly expand the role of the U.S. military in border enforcement \u2014 historically limited to operational and administrative duties \u2014 is part of a larger campaign to seal U.S. borders to migrants and asylum-seekers.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed U.S. immigration agents along the borders with Mexico and Canada to swiftly and summarily deport migrants crossing into the country illegally, denying them the opportunity to request asylum, according to CBP officials and internal documents.",
      "Those directions are being implemented in accordance with an unprecedented order issued by Mr. Trump that suspended the entry of unauthorized migrants into the country, based on the argument they are \"invading\" the U.S. and threatening public health and national security.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was allowed to take the drastic step through powers in the U.S. Constitution and a law known as 212(f) that empowers presidents to bar the entry of foreigners whose arrival is deemed to be \"detrimental\" to U.S. interests.",
      "While Mr. Trump made immigration a top issue in the campaign, his administration inherited a relatively calm southern border, with illegal crossings there at a four-year low. Unlawful crossings into the U.S. plunged in 2024 from the record highs in the previous three years due to a Mexican crackdown on migrants. They fell further after the Biden administration enacted restrictions on asylum last June.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the far-right group the Oath Keepers, visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday, days after his lengthy prison sentence was commuted by President Trump.",
      "Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years in prison in May 2023 for seditious conspiracy in one of the longest sentences for crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He was among the more than 1,500 defendants who were granted clemency on Monday, hours after Mr. Trump took office. Rhodes was released from federal custody on Tuesday, according to his lawyer.",
      "Speaking in a House office building Wednesday, Rhodes told reporters he was there to meet with House Republicans and advocate for a pardon for James Brown, a fellow Oath Keeper who was convicted of weapons charges in a separate federal case. Rhodes said he was not invited by any member of Congress and had not stepped foot in the Capitol.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Rhodes and his fellow Oath Keepers planned for violence ahead of the Capitol attack and celebrated their actions in the aftermath.",
      "Before Rhodes' sentencing, prosecutors said he \"pushed the idea among Oath Keepers members and others that with a large enough mob, they could intimidate Congress and its members and impose the conspirators' will rather than the American people's: to stop the certification of the next President of the United States.\"",
      "They added that Rhodes has called for \"violent opposition to the authority of the government of the United States for well over a decade\" and \"continues to advocate for political violence.\"",
      "In a recording four days after Jan. 6 that was played at his trial, Rhodes said his \"only regret is they should have brought rifles\" and that he would \"hang f****** Pelosi from the lamppost.\" Rhodes said Wednesday he regretted that comment, and that he was \"drunk and pissed off.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:04:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors have asked federal judges in Washington to dismiss pending indictments against defendants charged as a result of conduct on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's order issuing sweeping pardons to defendants convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol has been met with sharp condemnations from federal judges in Washington, D.C., who presided over the cases and are now dismissing charges at the request of federal prosecutors in the new administration.",
      "The judges publicly voiced their discontent in a trio of separate orders issued Wednesday, two days after Mr. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants and ordered any pending prosecutions to be dismissed just hours after he was sworn into office for a second term.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's order, prosecutors in Washington have been seeking to end ongoing cases. The Justice Department said earlier this month that there were roughly 300 pending cases related to the Capitol assault. Nearly 60% of those defendants were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement or obstructing those officers during a civil disorder, which are felonies, it said.",
      "Citing the years spent reviewing evidence and adjudicating hundreds of cases involving defendants charged with violent and nonviolent criminal offenses, the judges rebuked efforts to downplay the events of Jan. 6.",
      "One order issued by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversaw the election interference case against Mr. Trump that was dismissed after his election in November, states that \"no pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\"",
      "\"In hundreds of cases like this one over the past four years, judges in this district have administered justice without fear or favor,\" Chutkan wrote. \"The historical record established by those proceedings must stand, unmoved by political winds, as a testament and as a warning.\"",
      "The dismissal of the case, she said, \"cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"",
      "Chutkan's order came in the case against John Banuelos, an Illinois man who was arrested in March and faced five charges, including obstruction of law enforcement and entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Prosecutors said he was seen on security footage in a crowd of rioters who breached a police line on the Capitol grounds, and court documents allegedly show an image of Banuelos with what appears to be a firearm in the waistband of his pants. Security footage from the attack later appears to show him scaling scaffolding around the inaugural stage, pulling the gun from his waistband and firing two shots in the air, prosecutors said. Banuelos pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "Another order from U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell rebuffs Mr. Trump's claim that the Jan. 6 prosecutions represented a \"grave national injustice\" and that clemency would begin a \"process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "\"No 'national injustice' occurred here, just as no outcome-determinative election fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election,\" Howell wrote, quoting Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"No 'process of national reconciliation' can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity. That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law.\"",
      "The judge said she had presided over \"scores\" of cases involving defendants charged for their conduct outside and inside the Capitol building and said charges were \"fully supported\" by videos, photos, admissions by defendants themselves during plea hearings and the testimony of law enforcement and congressional staff who were at the Capitol.",
      "\"[T]his court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement,\" Howell wrote.",
      "She added that the cases reflect the work of prosecutors, law enforcement officers and defense attorneys \"to defend our democracy and rights and preserve our long tradition of peaceful transfers of power \u2014 which, until January 6, 2021, served as a model to the world \u2014 all while affording those charged every protection guaranteed by our Constitution and the criminal justice system.\"",
      "Howell was granting the government's request to dismiss a nine-count superseding indictment against Nicholas DeCarlo and Nicholas Ochs, who had earlier entered into plea deals and admitted to throwing smoke bombs at police officers and property damage and theft.",
      "Ochs founded the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, according to court documents. The two entered the Capitol and smoked cigarettes in the Crypt \u2014 which is located just below the Rotunda \u2014 filings show, and DeCarlo shouted \"Where's Nancy?\" a reference to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as they made their way through the building.",
      "A third order from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the government's request to toss out an indictment charging Dominic Box with seven felony and misdemeanor counts. He was found guilty of six counts last year, including civil disorder and disorderly conduct. Kollar-Kotelly wrote that Box was among the first group of rioters who entered the Capitol building on Jan. 6 and went on to overrun police officers in the Crypt.",
      "He was set to be sentenced on Feb. 21.",
      "Like her colleagues on the district court, Kollar-Kotelly said the events of Jan. 6 are preserved through videos, trial transcripts, jury verdicts and judicial opinions analyzing the evidence.",
      "\"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies,\" she wrote.",
      "Dismissal of charges, pardons and commutations of sentences, the judge said, \"will not change the truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\"",
      "Kollar-Kotelly also praised the Capitol Police and local law enforcement who responded to the attack at the Capitol to protect lawmakers and staff, the vice president and his family, and the Capitol building.",
      "\"For hours, those officers were aggressively confronted and violently assaulted. More than 140 officers were injured. Others tragically passed away as a result of the events of that day,\" she wrote. \"But law enforcement did not falter. Standing with bear spray streaming down their faces, those officers carried out their duty to protect.\"",
      "Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump had vowed to issue pardons to Jan. 6 defendants, who he has called \"hostages\" and political prisoners.\" But the scope of the pardons came as a surprise to some, as they were \"full, complete and unconditional.\"",
      "The president also commuted the sentences of 14 defendants, including high-ranking members of the far-right groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Some, like Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, were serving sentences after they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes.",
      "Howell and Chutkan were nominated to the court by former President Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Kollar-Kotelly was selected by former President Bill Clinton and has served since 1997.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security has terminated its advisory committees, wiping out decades of institutional experience and abruptly ending a sweeping investigation into the Chinese-linked hack of U.S. telecom companies, sources familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News.",
      "According to a memo signed by Acting DHS Secretary Benjamine C. Huffman, and obtained by CBS News, the decision to disband multiple advisory committees is being made \"in alignment with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) commitment to eliminating the misuse of resources and ensuring that DHS activities prioritize our national security.\"",
      "\"I am directing the termination of all current memberships on the advisory committees within DHS, effective immediately,\" the memo, dated Jan. 20, stated.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House approved the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday, signing off on the Senate's changes to the legislation aimed at expanding the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "The House passed the legislation in a 263 to 156 vote. It now heads to President Trump's desk, where it's expected to be the first piece of legislation he signs in his new term.",
      "The bill is named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. It would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. The legislation also includes a provision that empowers state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "\"This legislation would simply say that we have to detain some of the worst people that are here illegally,\" Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said on the House floor Wednesday.",
      "Some Democrats spent floor debate ahead of the vote focused on the pardons Mr. Trump granted to people convicted for their actions related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, arguing it was hypocritical for Republicans who supported the pardons to push this bill.",
      "\"These are the people who want you to believe, want us to believe, that they are keeping violent criminals off the streets,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said.",
      "The House approved a version of the legislation earlier this month in a 264 to 159 vote, with 48 Democrats joining Republicans. It then went to the Senate, where an amended version passed with bipartisan support on Monday.",
      "The Senate's changes expanded the legislation's scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. Democrats had also hoped to further amend the legislation, seeking to protect DACA recipients and eliminate the provision that empowers state attorneys general, among other things. Still, 12 Senate Democrats ultimately backed the legislation, propelling it to passage.",
      "The support from Democrats comes after the measure stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate last year, when the House first approved it. Democrats have appeared more willing to engage on the measure in the new Congress, following the 2024 election, in which immigration was a key issue.",

    "summary": "No president has ever exercised this constitutional power, but \"this remains a significant possibility in the eyes of the White House,\" one source said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is threatening to use his powers to adjourn Congress so he can make recess appointments for at least some of his top Cabinet nominees and their deputies, enabling them to begin running the largest federal departments.",
      "Mr. Trump most recently raised the prospect of plunging the executive and legislative branches into uncharted constitutional territory during his White House meeting Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, mulling the option if Democrats opt to slow-walk or delay his top national security and public health nominees, according to two people familiar with the meetings.",
      "\"This remains a significant possibility in the eyes of the White House,\" one of the people familiar with the meetings said, emphasizing this is not expected to happen this week, but remains under active consideration.",
      "Mr. Trump has signaled he wants the Senate to move quickly to confirm his top Cabinet picks, and Republican senators have said for weeks they want to move swiftly, particularly on his top national security appointments. On Monday night, the Senate unanimously confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state, but votes on John Ratcliffe to serve as CIA director, Pete Hegseth to serve as defense secretary, and Kristi Noem to serve as homeland security secretary, are still in the queue for consideration.",
      "Procedural issues are delaying those votes, with Democrats slowing consideration of Ratcliffe and Republicans warning they'll hold a final up-or-down vote on him over the weekend, if necessary.",
      "It is unclear how long Mr. Trump would recess Congress, given that a possible government shutdown looms in mid-March and Republican leaders have set an April goal of passing massive economic, tax and immigration legislation that would authorize Mr. Trump's plans to cut inflation and taxes and dramatically overhaul border security policy.",
      "How can Trump adjourn Congress?",
      "The second clause of Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution gives the president the power to convene the House and Senate in certain cases. While presidents over the course of U.S. history have frequently summoned both chambers for special sessions, or the Senate to vote on key nominees or treaties, no president has ever exercised his constitutional power to adjourn the two chambers.",
      "The lack of precedent means any Trump decision to adjourn the Senate would likely face immediate legal challenge ultimately resulting in appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Here's one example of how it would work: The House is scheduled to leave Washington for up to 10 days starting Friday, so the two parties can hold their annual policy retreats. The GOP-controlled House could pass a resolution formally adjourning for that length of time and send the resolution to the Senate. The upper chamber, where at least 60 votes would be needed to consider a consent resolution, would either also adjourn or fail to agree to do so. Under the Constitution, both houses of Congress must agree to adjourn for more than three days. If the Senate does not agree, the president could try using his adjournment power to send the Senate home, launching the executive and legislative branches into uncharted constitutional territory.",
      "Talk about flexing this never-used power dates back to the last year of the first Trump presidency, when Democrats were blocking hundreds of executive and judicial nominees. Conservative activists began pushing the White House to consider the adjournment powers, something Mr. Trump never used. Now, emboldened by his second victory and far more familiar with the powers of the presidency, Mr. Trump is actively discussing the option.",
      "The president raised the prospect of recess appointments in an advisory way to Thune on Tuesday, the sources said, who would prefer that Mr. Trump avoid this move to preserve and protect institutional prerogatives. On Tuesday after the Mr. Trump meeting, the Senate majority leader expressed public skepticism and said any move by Mr. Trump to adjourn Congress should be blamed on Democrats.",
      "\"I think we're going to find out here pretty quickly whether or not the Democrats want to help us get through some of these nominations in a way that gets us back on track with the way it was done prior to the last two presidencies,\" he said.",
      "Both parties have spent much of the 21st century using what had been obscure procedural tactics to delay or slowly derail presidential nominees for Cabinet posts, regulatory agency boards and federal judgeships.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "Any president can appoint someone to a position requiring Senate confirmation whenever the chamber is in recess. Back when the country began and traveling to and from Washington by horse or train took far longer, recess appointments were a far more urgent need. Now, with Congress able to function year-round, it's more of a political tactic.",
      "Any nominees appointed to a position during a congressional recess must be confirmed by the end of the next calendar year, meaning if Mr. Trump were to make recess appointments early this year, they could serve in their roles until December 2026. Once a new congressional session begins, a president can renominate recess appointees for Senate confirmation \u2014 or issue a fresh recess appointment for them.",
      "The biggest legal test of the power came in 2014, when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled President Obama had violated the recess appointments clause by naming three picks to the National Labor Relations Board in 2012. The justices said the Senate was not actually in a formal recess when Obama acted.",

      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",

      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomers discovered supersonic winds on a giant gas planet located over 500 light-years from Earth.",
      "In a study released Tuesday in Astronomy & Astrophysics astronomers who have been studying weather on the planet since 2016 said findings show this \"is the fastest wind ever measured in a jetstream that goes around a planet.\"",
      "\"This is something we haven't seen before,\" said Lisa Nortmann, a scientist at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, and lead author of the study.",
      "The team said they mapped the weather on the planet WASP-127b using the\u00a0CRIRES+ instrument\u00a0\u2014 which consists of both a spectrograph and an adaptive optics system \u2014 on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope.",
      "Findings showed WASP-127b, which is slightly larger than Jupiter but has only a fraction of its mass, had jet winds move at nearly six times the speed at which the planet rotates. In comparison, the fastest wind ever measured in the solar system was found on Neptune, moving at only 0.5 km per second, scientists said.",
      "The team mapped a surprisingly complex weather system on the planet by tracking the speed of molecules \u2014 they observed a double peak, indicating that one side of the atmosphere is moving towards us and the other away from us at high speed. This indicates that there is a powerful wind current going around the planet.",
      "Researchers concluded that powerful jetstream winds around the equator would explain this unexpected result, and shows the planet has complex weather systems like Earth and other planets in our solar system.",
      "\"Understanding the dynamics of these exoplanets helps us explore mechanisms such as heat redistribution and chemical processes, improving our understanding of planet formation and potentially shedding light on the origins of our own Solar System,\" says David Cont from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, and a co-author of the paper.",
      "Of the exoplanets discovered so far, only a few dozen have been directly imaged, according to\u00a0NASA. Scientists hope that further research will reveal if the young planets formed at their current location or migrated from somewhere else \u2014 and how they might interact with each other.",

    "story": [
      "Meta is denying claims circulating on social media that it forced Facebook and Instagram users to follow President Trump's official accounts, saying the changes some users noticed were standard practices tied to the transition of the POTUS account from the previous administration to the incoming one.",
      "The company also said that it is working to resolve an issue on Instagram that temporarily blocked certain political terms, including \"Democrats\" and \"Republican,\" from search results.",
      "Some Facebook and Instagram users reported on Monday that their accounts automatically followed President Trump, Vice President Vance, and first lady Melania Trump's accounts under the @POTUS, @VicePresident, and @FLOTUS handles, respectively. Some said they never followed the accounts in the first place, and when they tried to unfollow the pages they were prevented from doing so.",
      "Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the company did not make people's accounts follow the official presidential Facebook and Instagram accounts. Instead, people who had previously followed the official POTUS account saw it updated to reflect President Trump taking office.",
      "\"This is the same procedure we followed during the last presidential transition,\" Stone said, adding that people may experience delays when they try to follow or unfollow \"as these accounts change hands.\"",
      "Meta's public affairs director Nkechi Nneji told CBS News, \"Meta doesn't make anyone follow any account and we never have.\" Nneji said people might have forgotten that they opted to follow the official White House accounts during previous administrations.",
      "Katie Harbath, Facebook's former public policy director for global elections from 2011 to 2021, said her team was involved in helping establish the company's first presidential social media transition as Obama left office in 2017.",
      "The Trump administration followed the same protocols again in 2021 when they passed the accounts over to the Biden administration. The process allows for each incoming president to have a clean slate for their social media profiles.",
      "\"That would give them the opportunity to set up the page how they want, make sure it's got the cover photo, all that jazz,\" Harbath told CBS News. \"Then it was decided that under the assumption that people are following the institution \u2014 regardless of who's in it \u2014 that the followers would be mirrored over, copied over to the new page.\"",
      "In general, when users want to unfollow an account on Facebook, they can click the ellipsis on that profile page and press the \"unfollow\" or \"block\" button.",
      "Additionally, some Instagram users reported being unable to see results for \"Democrat\" and other political words when they searched them, but that they were able to see results for \"Republican.\"",
      "Stone responded to the claims on Tuesday, saying a technical issue was \"affecting people's ability to search for a number of different hashtags on the platform \u2014 not just those on the left.\" Nneji told CBS News on Wednesday that technical issues with searches for political and non-political terms had mostly been resolved on the mobile app.",
      "CBS News searched variations of \"Democrat\" and \"Republican\" on the mobile version of Instagram on Wednesday and returned millions of results.",
      "However, on the desktop version of Instagram, the search returned no results for \"Republican\" and \"Democrats,\" but did yield results for \"Republicans\" and \"Democrat.\" Additionally, there were no results for other words, like \"Constitution,\" on the desktop version, but over a million results on the mobile app.",
      "Mr. Trump's personal Facebook and Instagram accounts were\u00a0suspended\u00a0following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, after the company said his posts incited violence. His accounts were\u00a0reactivated\u00a0in 2023.",
      "The timing of the latest issues raised concerns among some Facebook and Instagram users. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended President Trump's inauguration on Monday, along with other tech leaders including X owner Elon Musk and Amazon executive chair Jeff Bezos.",
      "Zuckerberg announced the end\u00a0of Facebook's third-party fact checking program on Jan. 7 because of what he said were concerns of bias and the over-enforcement of rules. The platform will instead adopt a community approach similar to X's Community Notes.",
      "Zuckerberg also announced the platform would start phasing in more recommendations for political content, reversing a decision made in February 2021 when Zuckerberg said he received feedback that people \"don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience.\"",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said in a statement on Meta's website that the shift was \"an attempt to return to the commitment to free expression.\"",
      "\"That means being vigilant about the impact our policies and systems are having on people's ability to make their voices heard, and having the humility to change our approach when we know we're getting things wrong,\" Kaplan said.",
      "Corynne McSherry, legal director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights organization, told CBS News social platforms are not transparent enough about how their platforms work for users.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "story": [
      "Monterey County supervisors on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in response to last week's major fire at the Vistra lithium battery plant in Moss Landing.",
      "The emergency declaration came during a special meeting where officials gave updates on the fire and ongoing response. While the fire has burned itself out, there are still a lot of questions from local leaders and neighbors about what's next.",
      "\"This was the beginning,\" said Josh Contreras as he showed photos he took of the incident from his houseboat.",
      "The images show a fireball on the horizon, not even a mile away.",
      "\"I walked up the docks, and then I took more photos,\" he said. \"Because you could see the flames, probably almost as tall as the towers that stand here.\"",
      "The fire at the Moss Landing Vistra Power Plant, located about 90 miles south of San Francisco,\u00a0broke out last Thursday afternoon, escalating in the early evening to the point where the incident\u00a0triggered evacuations for about 1,200 Monterey County residents\u00a0in the area and shut down a section of Highway 1 in both directions.",
      "Concerned over the potentially toxic runoff if fire crews turned hoses on the burning lithium batteries, officials instead are allowing the to burn itself out.",
      "Officials\u00a0said the fire was largely out as of late Friday morning\u00a0during a press conference, but it flared up significantly for a few hours that afternoon before dying down again. Officials were eventually able to lift the evacuation orders by early Friday evening. The stretch of Highway 1 near the plant remained closed until Sunday.",
      "Now that the fire is out, he is one of the many people living in the area what lies in the future for the facility.",
      "\"If they do battery packs, they should keep it in more deserted areas,\" Contreras said.",
      "\"This technology is ahead of the government's ability to regulate it,\" Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church said during the emergency meeting Tuesday. \"And the industry's ability to control it.\"",
      "Supervisors were asking similar questions about the fire. A representative from Vistra said were just getting access to the burned-out lithium battery facility. The incident was enough for Church, who last week likened the fire to a \"Three Mile Island\" event for the emerging industry -- to draw this conclusion:",
      "\"Battery storage is essential for the future. And that's the direction we're going,\" Church noted. \"But -- as I said last night and I've tried to emphasize -- we just can't put that above safety. That's got to be the priority at this point.\"",
      "Church is calling for the Vistra facility to remain closed until an independent investigation can determine the cause of the incident.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we're on a pretty steep learning curve with battery safety still,\" said Dustin Mulvaney, a professor of environmental sciences at San Jose State University. \"And we're still figuring out ways that these batteries catch on fire. We're still figuring out how to best suppress them.\"",
      "Mulvaney  said the Moss Landing facility fire will be a wake-up call for the entire industry, right down to the people who insure the batteries. A lot of people will want to know what went wrong, and where, in a plant that is a hodgepodge of lithium battery technology.",
      "\"That site is actually an example of different ways to design it,\" Mulvaney explained. \"Because it was built in different phases. They took advantage of different opportunities to put things in different places. But this example will cause the industry to reflect on how they built these things. Because they have to be better neighbors to the community.\"",
      "Those who live in the community are reflecting on what it means to have this plant as a neighbor.",
      "\"Yeah. It should be out in the desert,\" said plant neighbor Julie Nieman. \"Somewhere in Nevada, out in the desert where people aren't around. Why would you put it where people live, in this beautiful area by the ocean?\"",
      "With the exception of one closed roadway beside the plant, things in Moss Landing are pretty much back to normal. The parks and beaches have to reopened, though some people have raised additional questions about the impact the fire had on the environment, particularly the sensitive Elkhorn Slough Reserve. The wetlands area is home to a number of endangered sea otters.",

      "For 14-year-old Ben Cohen-Vigder, accidentally losing his smartphone on the school bus last February ended up gaining him so much more.",
      "\"I was without my phone for like two days and I realized how my days were so much longer and full,\" Ben said.",
      "It was so much better that the 8th grade lacrosse goalie made the radical choice to get a flip phone, giving him the ability to communicate without all the smart features \u2014 and distractions.",
      "A growing number of experts are sounding the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023 advisory on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating \"tech-free zones\" and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile, several states have taken steps to ban cellphones in schools.",
      "Swapping smartphones for flip phones",
      "Ben said he used to average up to five hours of screen time per day. Once he switched to a flip phone, it went down to about 30 minutes. So, CBS News asked four of Ben's friends, Carson, Ranita, Jamison and Maya \u2014 all 8th graders in New Jersey \u2014 to try flip phones for a week. Maya said her average screen time at the beginning of the week was more than 10 hours, spent mostly watching TV and on Tiktok.",
      "They were curious but skeptical about the experiment. Jamison said he wasn't doing as well as he wanted to in school and thought his phone use could be a \"big factor in that.\" Although Ranita plays three sports, she admitted wasting time on her phone, watching 30 minutes of scrolling turn into an hour without noticing. Carson agreed to participate, but the avid basketball player was nervous. Maya, who loves studying English and just started rowing, was hoping the trial would help her sleep better at night.",
      "The day CBS News sat down with the teens and took their iPhones and iPads and gave them flip phones, the reactions were a mix of laughing, shaking and confusion.

      "Carson didn't make it and asked for his phone back within 24 hours, saying he sat staring at the wall until he had basketball practice after school. The others stuck it out, sending in mostly positive reviews in video diaries taken on their parents phones throughout the experiment.",

Half of American teenagers aged 12 to 18 had four hours or more of daily screen time during a period between July 2021 and December 2023. Almost 23% had three hours of daily screen time, 17.8% had two hours, 6.1% had one hour, and only 3% had less than one hour, according to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:19:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "Washington \u2014 TikTok began restoring service to users in the United States following a temporary and voluntary shutdown that lasted less than a day. The company said Sunday that it was in the process of reinstating access after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to try to pause the ban by executive order on his first day in office.",
      "\"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\" TikTok said in a statement. \"It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"",
      "STATEMENT FROM TIKTOK:In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170\u2026",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's China-bases parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "Users in the U.S. who opened the app late Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",

      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",
      "\"On the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Prelogar, who said, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"And whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Sotomayor continued, referring to the penalties facing app stores and web hosting services.",

We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:20:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Nearly 60% of Americans don't have enough money put away to handle common financial emergencies, according to Bankrate.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's a busted refrigerator, car trouble or medical issues, unexpected costs are a part of life. But even such routine curveballs often spell serious financial trouble for many Americans.",
      "That's according to a new Bankrate report that surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults about their ability to handle a surprise bill. Despite the country's current\u00a0low unemployment rate, the annual study found that 59% of Americans in 2025 don't have enough savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense.",
      "\"We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,\" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. \"Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation, the impacts of which are still being felt.\"",
      "A key issue in the 2024 presidential election, inflation and the rising\u00a0cost of everyday items\u00a0continues to impact Americans. Grocery inflation during the height of the coronavirus epidemic reached a\u00a0peak of 13.5% in 2022, while the overall rate of inflation for all products and services topped out at 9.1%.",
      "Although inflation has cooled to an annual rate of 2.9% as of December, prices for food, shelter and many other items remain elevated. Consumers also have found that many common products, from snacks to paper towels, have gotten smaller, a retailing tactic\u00a0known as \"shrinkflation\u00a0aimed at cutting a manufacturer's costs.",
      "In his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, President Trump said he would direct his cabinet \"to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\"",
      "Whether the Trump administration can engineer such a feat remains to be seen, while polls suggest that many Americans are skeptical that prices will return to earth. Economists also warn that Mr. Trump's policies, which could include steep new tariffs on U.S. imports and the deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary.",
      "Younger Americans worry most",
      "To be sure, the meteoric rise in the cost of food, housing and health care over the past several years has made it hard for many households to make ends meet, let alone save money. Bankrate's survey shows that 73% of Americans said they're saving less for unexpected expenses, compared with 68% in 2024.",
      "\"Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings,\" according to the Bankrate report.",
      "Younger Americans tend to have the strongest concerns about their savings. A whopping 80% of Gen Zers worry about being able to cover immediate expenses if they were to suddenly lose their primary source of income, compared with 72% for Millennials and Gen Xers. Some 58% of Baby Boomers say they regularly fret about having enough money put away, a particular concern given that many are already retired.",
      "Borrower nation",
      "Only 41% of Americans said they would be able to tap their savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to Bankrate's report. That's down 3% from 2024 and the lowest the percentage since 2021 (39%)",
      "Another 25% said they would use a credit card to pay for a $1,000 bill, 13% said they would turn to a family member for the money and 5% said they would take out a personal loan. In total, about 43% of respondents told Bankrate they would have to borrow money to pay for an emergency expense of $1,000.",
      "That's a concern given consumers collectively owe a record $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0show. Meanwhile, credit card rates continue to soar, hovering round 24%.",
      "\"The cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\" Hamrick said. \"They are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\"",
      "Another 13% of Americans said they would pay for a surprise $1,000 debt by curbing their spending, On a positive note, while 36% of adults said their credit card debt exceeded what they had in emergency savings, Bankrate found that more than half of survey respondents, at 55%, had more emergency savings in 2024 than credit card debt. That's the highest percentage since 2018.",
      "Asked how much they have in emergency savings, 28% of respondents said they had enough to cover six months of expenses; 16% said they had enough to cover three to five months; 29% had enough to cover less than three months' worth of bills; and 27% said they had no emergency savings at all.",
      "Tips for saving now",
      "For people who consider themselves among the roughly one-third of Americans who want to reduce their debt and boost their emergency savings in 2025, Bankrate offers three tips:",
      "Calculate how much you need to save.\u00a0As a general target, experts recommend saving three to six months' worth of expenses in case of emergencies. To figure out how much to put away, add the total amount you spend each month on food, housing, gas and other bills. So if your monthly bills amount to $2,000 a month, you'll need $6,000 in savings to stay afloat in case of an emergency, such as a job loss.",
      "Open a savings account just for emergencies.\u00a0Opening an online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can help you save for unexpected emergencies.",

      "As he signed the order \u2014 which will also lead to the release of files pertaining to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as King \u2014 Mr. Trump called it \"a big one,\" and he said \"a lot of people are waiting for this for a long \u2014 for years, for decades.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0 Trump is ordering the director of national intelligence and attorney general to come up with a plan within 45 days to release all the RFK and MLK files. They will have just 15 days to propose a plan within 15 days to release the JFK files, though the president's nominees for both those roles have not yet been confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The civil rights icon was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, as he stood on the balcony of the old Lorraine Motel. King, who was 39 years old, was rushed to a hospital, where he died of a bullet wound to the neck, as CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite reported that day.",
      "Why is Trump releasing the MLK Jr. assassination files?",
      "Mr. Trump said at a rally in Washington, D.C., on the eve of his inauguration that he would make the files public to signal a restoration of \"transparency and accountability to government.\"",
      "He said his administration would \"reverse the overclassification of government documents, and in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, as well as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and other topics of great public interest.\"",
      "What is known about the MLK Jr. assassination?",
      "Ray, a repeat offender who had served time in prison for robbery convictions, had been on the run for 11 months, having escaped from the Missouri State Penitentiary, where he had been serving a 20-year sentence.",
      "On the afternoon of April 4, 1968, Ray rented a room under an assumed name at a Memphis rooming house near the Lorraine Motel. In early May, he was indicted, and an international manhunt ensued. Ray was captured on June 8, 1968, at Heathrow Airport, in London. He was extradited and returned to the U.S. the following month and pleaded guilty, receiving a sentence of 99 years.",
      "There were allegations that the FBI was complicit in King's assassination, too, however, so a select committee conducted its own investigation. The National Archives noted that the committee \"recognized that FBI files were potentially tainted,\" but it never uncovered evidence to show any complicity by the bureau. However, the committee \"did note major deficiencies in the scope and method of the FBI's postassassination investigation,\" the archives said.",
      "The FBI conducted surveillance of King for years, targeting him with a counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO. The archives noted that a Senate select committee investigated and published a report exposing the \"full scope of the attempt by the FBI to discredit Dr. King.\"",
      "The Justice Department launched a task force to probe the FBI's harassment and investigations of King, as well as his assassination and the criminal investigation. It was also assigned to determine whether those FBI efforts might have had an effect on King's assassination. The task force ultimately concluded that Ray acted along but also found that the FBI's actions involving COINTELPRO's efforts to undermine King should not have been continued and were \"very probably...felonious.\"",
      "What MLK Jr. assassination files have already been released?",
      "The National Archives website houses information from the select committee's investigation of King's assassination, encompassing its handling of Ray and the FBI's surveillance of King, as well as the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and of his brother, Robert F. Kennedy.",

In 1977, a federal judge ordered the FBI to turn the material over to the archives and ordered it sealed for 50 years. The documents are not to be made public until February 2027.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate confirmed John Ratcliffe as CIA director on Thursday as Republicans work to approve officials to the top posts in President Trump's administration amid delays by Democrats.",
      "The Senate confirmed Ratcliffe in a 74 to 25 vote, making him the second of Mr. Trump's nominees to be approved by the upper chamber. He was sworn in by Vice President JD Vance on Thursday afternoon.",
      "Senate Democrats slowed Ratcliffe's confirmation after his nomination advanced out of committee earlier this week, forcing procedural maneuvers to extend consideration of his nomination in recent days.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Republican whip, celebrated earlier Thursday that the Senate was poised to confirm Ratcliffe's nomination, calling it \"a win for our national security,\" while noting that it \"should have been done two days ago.\"",
      "\"But Democrats unnecessarily delayed this important vote,\" Barrasso continued. \"John Ratcliffe is undeniably qualified for the job, he's going to lead the CIA without bias, and with the safety of the American people being his priority.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, objected to a time agreement that would have allowed the Senate to quickly vote on Ratcliffe's nomination, expressing \"serious concerns\" about Ratcliffe's ability to distance himself from Mr. Trump's political interests and urging that it wasn't too much to ask for senators to have time to debate the nomination on the floor.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term. At that time, Mr. Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Mr. Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Testifying last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ratcliffe said he's devoted his professional life to national security \"for roughly a quarter of a century.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "He pledged that if was confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee during his time in Congress and was a staunch defender of Mr. Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference. Democrats criticized Ratcliffe for declassifying Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about members of their party during the 2016 race, intelligence that Ratcliffe acknowledged might not be true.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday morning that he would \"respectfully vote no\" on Ratcliffe's confirmation, saying he's \"deeply worried that Mr. Ratcliffe will be unable to stand up to people like Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"I have my doubts that Mr. Ratcliffe will be able to hold firm,\" the New York Democrat added.",
      "Despite the concern from Democrats, Ratcliffe is considered to be a more traditional choice than some of Mr. Trump's other nominations after previously serving in a Senate-confirmed position. The Senate also generally prioritizes nominees serving in national security roles when a new administration begins.",
      "Ratcliffe told the intelligence committee that the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" saying that the challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day 1 to take them head-on.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Seattle granted a request for a temporary restraining order sought by four states to block Trump's executive order against birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked President Trump's new executive order that seeks to eliminate birthright citizenship.",
      "At a hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour called Mr. Trump's order \"blatantly unconstitutional\" and said he will grant the request for a temporary restraining order sought by four Democrat-led states that challenged it: Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon.",
      "The judge's order will remain in place while legal proceedings continue and is an early blow to the unilateral efforts undertaken by Mr. Trump to crack down on immigration, which he promised to do on the campaign trail and began to pursue almost immediately after he was sworn in for a second term Monday.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said the department \"will vigorously defend President Trump's [executive order], which correctly interprets the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation's laws enforced.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that his administration will appeal the decision, but declined to respond further.",
      "Kwame Raoul, the Illinois attorney general, said the state is pleased the court blocked the president's executive order.",
      "\"The right of an individual born in this country to be a citizen of this country was enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution more than 150 years ago following the Civil War. No president has the authority to override the Constitution. Period,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The president's order targeting birthright citizenship was among a wave of executive actions he signed just after his inauguration. The order directs federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents such as passports to children born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally or under temporary visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's move was swiftly challenged by the four states and a separate group of 18 others, as well as advocacy groups.",
      "In a four-page order issued after the hearing, Coughenour wrote that the president's executive action harms the states by forcing their agencies to \"lose federal funding and incur substantial costs to provide essential and legally required medical care and social services to resident children\" subject to his measure. He found the states' residents are also harmed by \"depriving them of their constitutional right to citizenship and all the associated rights and benefits.\"",
      "Citing his four decades on the bench, Coughenour said he \"can't remember\" a case that presented a question \"as clear as this.\"",
      "Coughenour was the first judge to convene a hearing on the issue, during which he considered the request from the four states to temporarily block implementation of the order.",
      "The judge, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1991, said he would have a difficult time imagining members of the bar finding Mr. Trump's order to be constitutional.",
      "The four states argued Mr. Trump's order seeking to end birthright citizenship violates the 14th Amendment, which states that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"",
      "\"Through the order, babies being born today aren't considered American citizens anymore,\" Lane Polozola, a lawyer representing Washington state, argued during the hearing, adding that hundreds of thousands of children across the country will be impacted by Mr. Trump's action.",
      "Polozola said the removal of birthright citizenship is \"off limits.\"",
      "But Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer who defended the order, said it would be \"wildly inappropriate and premature\" to grant a temporary restraining order at this moment that blocks implementation of the measure. He predicted that the challenge to Mr. Trump's measure will eventually wind up before the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",

    "story": [
      "The nomination of Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump's pick for Defense Secretary, advanced in a procedural vote Thursday afternoon, 51-49. Both Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted \"no\" in a procedural vote on Hegseth's confirmation Thursday.",
      "Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday she is \"unable to support\" Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense, becoming the first Republican to state her opposition to President Trump's nominee ahead of his Senate confirmation vote.",
      "Collins of Maine soon followed in saying she won't vote for Hegseth, citing his views on women in combat.",
      "Murkowski had been seen on Capitol Hill as a possible \"no\" vote and had tough questions for Hegseth about his views on women in combat, about his character, and about his lack of an FBI background check.",
      "\"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook,\" Murkowsi said in a lengthy statement Thursday. \"Given the global security environment we're operating in, it is critical that we confirm a Secretary of Defense, however, I regret that I am unable to support Mr. Hegseth.\"",
      "Murkowski also expressed skepticism over Hegseth's leadership experience, saying his \"limited managerial experience involved running two small non-profit organizations that had decidedly mixed results.\"",
      "\"After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against Pete Hegseth's nomination for Secretary of Defense,\" Collins said in a statement. \"While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job.\"",
      "Hegseth fielded tough questions from Democrats over his views on\u00a0women in the military\u00a0and an\u00a0allegation of sexual assault\u00a0during his confirmation hearing. After Trump announced his nomination, reports surfaced of an alleged sexual assault, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of veterans' organizations Hegseth ran. To control the damage and prove his mettle, Hegseth barnstormed the Capitol for meetings with mostly Republican senators.",
      "Murkowski praised his military service and his advocacy for veterans but said those factors \"do not alleviate my significant concerns regarding his nomination.\"",
      "She pointed to his record in leading two veterans' organizations, stating that his leadership \"was marked with accusations of financial mismanagement and problems with the workplace culture he fostered.\"",
      "And Murkowski, noting he had \"recently revised his statements on women in combat since being nominated,\" said she is still \"concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join.\"",
      "Hegseth needs a simple majority in the Senate to be confirmed, and in the event of a tie, Vice President JD Vance can break it. He can afford to lose no more than three Republicans.",
      "Hegseth won over a key Republican, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who told an Iowa radio station soon after his confirmation hearing that he had her support.",
      "Murkowski said she's carefully reviewed Hegseth's writings and other materials and received \"substantial feedback\" from constituents, veterans and other organizations.",
      "\"After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense,\" she wrote.",

    "story": [
      "As interest rates climbed, major banks charged borrowers more for mortgages and auto loans, yet never increased payouts to savers, despite telling lawmakers they would do so, say two U.S. senators in letters to seven CEOs, shared exclusively with CBS News.",
      "In March 2022, the Federal Reserve started raising the federal funds rate, with banks following suit by hiking rates for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. But those increases were not matched with high interest rate payouts on savings accounts at banks including Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, according to the lawmakers.",
      "\"This tactic \u2014 charging borrowers more, paying savers a little, and pocketing interest paid by the Federal Reserve \u2014 has enabled U.S. banks to rake in record profits of $1 trillion and JPMorgan alone to make record profits of $49.6 billion in 2023,\" according to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island), the authors of the letters. Meanwhile, \"savers have struggled to keep up with inflation,\" they added.",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and his counterparts at half a dozen other financial institutions\u00a0testified\u00a0before the Senate Banking Committee in September of 2022 that their respective banks expected to increase rates for savers, albeit at a slower pace. While interest rates on the accounts JPMorgan keeps at the Fed rose from 3.15% to 4.65%, JPMorgan's customers continue to earn .01% on their savings, the lawmakers stated.",
      "\"These banks pledged in front of the United States Congress they would meaningfully pass on higher savings rates to their customers after hiking the cost of loans to pad their profits. Families across the country are struggling with inflation \u2014 these CEOs need to keep their word, not double-dip at the expense of their customers' savings,\" Warren told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "\"Experts have called megabanks' current net interest income a 'Goldilocks situation,' where banks have benefitted from higher Federal Reserve interest rates and kept deposit rates low,\" Warren and Reed noted in their letters, which called on the CEOs to explain what portion of their compensation had been based on their banks' \"interest-rate profiteering over the last two years.\"",

    "summary": "The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous Purdue bankruptcy settlement was struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2024. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions of dollars that would have gone to victims was stuck, and we had to go back to square one,\" said Cheryl Juaire, a mother who lost two sons to opioid addiction, at a press conference with James announcing the settlement.",
      "\"Three and a half years ago, in the midst of this case, I lost my second son Sean, also to an overdose. I buried him in the midst of an ongoing mediation,\" she said. \"I truly hope that no one ever has to feel the devastation I have felt in losing two of my three children.\"",
      "Juaire noted that the new deal is \"even more than the original deal\" but emphasized that \"this will only happen if the parties that stood in the way the last time will not do so again.\"",
      "James has secured up to $250 million for New York from the settlement to support opioid treatment and recovery programs. She negotiated the settlement along with attorney generals from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.",

      "Fishermen helped Coast Guard crewmembers rescue four Americans who were stranded on a life raft in the Atlantic Ocean north of the Dominican Republic, officials said Wednesday.",
      "David Potts, John Potts, Andrew Cullar and Russel Case were sailing the Mariposa from St. Croix to Texas, with plans to make a stop in Key West, the Coast Guard said in a news release, which included dramatic video of the rescue. They had to abandon ship after the boat struck a rock, rolled, struck another rock and began sinking.",
      "Early Tuesday morning, Coast Guard watchstanders at the San Juan Command Center received a possible distress alert from an emergency positioning radio beacon. The beacon was about 180 miles northwest of Puerto Rico. The watchstanders directed an aircraft to launch from Air Station Borinquen in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to search for signs of distress.",
      "The watchstanders also issued a call asking vessels in the area to be on the lookout for possible distress. The El Coqu\u00ed, a 720-foot container ship that was traveling from San Juan, Puerto Rico to Jacksonville, Florida, diverted to search the area.",
      "The Coast Guard aircrew located the life raft quickly. They also spotted a fishing vessel, the Bonanza, in the area, with several smaller boats. The Coast Guard conducted a series of low passes to get the attention of the Bonanza's crew. The Bonanza's crew were then steered to the life raft.",
      "The fishermen were able to approach the life raft and rescue the survivors. The Bonanza crew then transported the survivors to the El Coqu\u00ed. The El Coqu\u00ed continued on its journey to Jacksonville, with the survivors on board.",
      "The ship is expected to arrive in Jacksonville on Thursday. The Coast Guard said there were no reported medical concerns from the four men.",

      "More than two years after recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally, Google-owned Fitbit will pay a $12.2 million penalty for failing to alert consumers that the products can overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday.",
      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",
      "Fitbit discontinued production of its Ionic model, which was used to track activity, heart rate and sleep, in 2020.",
      "\"Customer safety continues to be our top priority, and we're pleased to resolve this matter with the CPSC stemming from the 2022 voluntary recall of Fitbit Ionic,\" said a spokesperson for Google, which purchased\u00a0Fitbit for $2.1 billion\u00a0in 2019.",
      "About 1 million of the recalled smartwatches were sold in the U.S. at retailers including Best Buy, Kohl's and Target, as well as online at Amazon.com and Fitbit.com from September 2017 through December 2021. The products retailed for between $200 and $330 each. Another 693,000 were sold internationally, according to the company.",
      "The 2020 recall came eight years after Fitbit\u00a0recalled\u00a0its Fitbit Force activity-tracking wristband after the company received roughly 9,900 reports of the wristband irritating skin and 250 reports of blistering.",
      "In addition to the $12.25 million civil penalty, the settlement agreement requires Fitbit to maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Act. The company also agreed to submit an annual report regarding its compliance program and internal controls, the CPSC stated.",

    "story": [
      "Two Native Hawaiian brothers who were convicted in the 1991 killing of a woman visiting Hawaii allege in a federal lawsuit that local police framed them \"under immense pressure to solve the high-profile murder\" then botched an investigation last year that would have revealed the real killer using advancements in DNA technology.",
      "Albert \"Ian\" Schweitzer, who had been incarcerated for more than two decades for the killing of Dana Ireland, was released in 2023 based on new evidence. Ireland, 23, a tourist from Virginia, was visiting a remote part of the Big Island when she was found along a fishing trail, raped and beaten and barely alive. She died at a hospital.",
      "Schweitzer was one of three men who spent time behind bars over her killing, but he always maintained his innocence. His brother Shawn Schweitzer took a deal to plead guilty to manslaughter and kidnapping - and receive credit for about a year served and five years of probation - after a jury convicted his brother in 2000.",
      "The brothers' lawsuit insists they \"had nothing to do with the crime\" and that investigators never found physical evidence linking them to Ireland's murder.",
      "The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Honolulu. It names as defendants Hawaii County, the county police chief, as well as former detectives and a prosecutor who handled the case. Both the county and the police chief say they won't comment on pending litigation.",
      "The lawsuit includes officers who have since died but retired public defender Alexander Silvert told HawaiiNewsNow that's not unusual.",
      "\"It is important to name everybody individually,\" Silvert told the station.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the misconduct continued into last year, when advancements in DNA technology led to the identification of a new possible suspect who killed himself after police took a DNA swab from him.",
      "Police took no steps to arrest 57-year-old Albert Lauro Jr., who lived less than 2 miles from where Ireland's body was found, even when they knew DNA connected him to the crime scene evidence, lawyers for the Schweitzers said.",
      "\"Instead, Defendants released Mr. Lauro, allowing a man who had been hiding a secret for more than two decades to return home free to do whatever he wanted to do,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "William Harrison, one of the Honolulu attorneys for the brothers, said the Hawaii Innocence Project\u00a0warned the police department\u00a0not to release Lauro, HawaiiNewsNow reported.",
      "\"We told them that he would either run or he would commit suicide and you know, our words came true,\" Harrison said.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for claims including denying the brothers their constitutional right to due process, conspiracy and malicious prosecution.",
      "Harrison said Wednesday a separate effort is ongoing to seek compensation from the state for their wrongful convictions. Ian Schweitzer is entitled to $50,000 for every year spent in prison as a result of his wrongful conviction, Harrison said, noting Shawn Schweitzer spent a year in jail.",

    "story": [
      "Attorneys for a man charged with murder in connection with the killings of four University of Idaho students are asking a judge to throw out most of the evidence in the case because they say it all hinges on an unconstitutional genetic investigation process.",
      "Bryan Kohberger's defense team also contends that the search warrants in the case were tainted by police misconduct. They will make their arguments during a two-day hearing starting Thursday morning, part of which will be closed to the public. If they are successful, it could throw a major wrench in the prosecution's case before the trial starts in August.",
      "Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, who were killed in the early morning of Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys say law enforcement violated his constitutional rights when they used a process called Investigative Genetic Genealogy, or IGG, to identify possible suspects.",
      "\"There would be no investigation into him without that original constitutional violation,\" attorneys Jay Weston Logsdon and Ann Taylor wrote in a court filing. They later continued, \"Without IGG, there is no case, no request for his phone records, surveillance of his parents' home, no DNA taken from the garbage out front. Because the IGG analysis is the origin of this matter, everything in the affidavit should be excised.\"",
      "The IGG process often starts when DNA found at the scene of a crime doesn't yield any results through standard law enforcement databases. When that happens, investigators may look at all the variations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, that are in the DNA sample. Those SNPs, or \"snips,\" are then uploaded to a genealogy database like GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA to look for possible relatives of the person whose DNA was found at the scene.",
      "In Kohberger's case, investigators said they found \"touch DNA,\" or trace DNA, on the sheath of a knife that was found in the home where the students were fatally stabbed. The FBI used the IGG process on that DNA and the information identified Kohberger as a possible suspect.",
      "Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson and the rest of the prosecution team say there is nothing unconstitutional about the use of IGG, noting that Kohberger's relatives voluntarily provided their own DNA to a genetic genealogy service. They've also argued in court filings that case law is clear: Defendants have no reasonable right to privacy for DNA that is left at the scene of a crime.",
      "The defense team also says that once Kohberger was identified as a possible suspect, law enforcement officers either purposely or recklessly lied or omitted crucial information when they asked the court to issue search warrants for his apartment, his parents' house, his car, his cellphone and even for his own DNA. They want all of that evidence kept out of the trial as well.",
      "Specific details about the alleged police misconduct are hidden from public view, however; 4th District Judge Steven Hippler has kept most of those court filings, along with many of the court documents on the IGG evidence, under seal. Part of the hearing starting Thursday will be held behind closed doors because the judge says he doesn't want potential jurors \"tainted\" by hearing about any evidence that might not be allowed in trial.",
      "On Wednesday, a coalition of news organizations including The Associated Press asked the judge to reconsider the secrecy.",
      "\"In any criminal case, I would submit that it's of extreme public interest to know whether a law enforcement officer sworn to tell the truth ... made reckless or false statements\" during an investigation, the news organizations' attorney, Wendy Olson, said during a hearing on Wednesday. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that the public and the press have a First Amendment right to open court proceedings, she said, and that open courts also help to protect the rights of the accused.",
      "\"Openness and transparency are more important than ever in maintaining and restoring confidence in our government institutions,\" Olson said.",
      "The judge was unswayed.",
      "\"I don't think much has changed in terms of the need to protect the jury pool here, given the intense media scrutiny that has and continues to follow this case,\" Hippler said. \"We will be challenged under the best of circumstances in obtaining a jury that has not been overly exposed to this ... and in particular, exposed to evidence that may not come into this trial.\"",
      "The judge said no one would be allowed into the courtroom but that the open portions of the hearing would be livestreamed from the court's YouTube page.",
      "\"He deserves to die,\" victim's mother says",
      "In November, Kristi and Steve Goncalves, the parents of Kaylee Goncalves, said the details of the case show the death penalty is merited.",
      "\"You've got four victims, all in one house - that's more than enough,\" Steve Goncalves said.",

      "\"It's the key sector that comes up time and time again,\" Brown said, noting that harvesting delicate fruit is more labor-intensive than, for example, growing cereal crops. That means mass deportations could lead to price hikes in the fruit aisle.",
      "\"The inflationary impact could affect food overall, but particularly fresher fruits, rather than the ingredients in more processed foods,\" he said.",
      "Construction companies, including businesses focused on home renovations and landscaping, have the next highest share of undocumented workers and would also likely face a labor shortage if the government clamps down.",
      "\"With regard to home improvement projects those prices, they might become unaffordable to the point where people feel they can't do them anymore. And the lack of supply will be a big issue there, too,\" Brown said.",
      "Restaurants and food service businesses, which employ large numbers of undocumented workers, could be at particular risk if deportations flare. A shortage of workers would likely force such enterprises, including millions of small eateries around the U.S., to raise their wages to attract new employees. But that would also lead to hikes in menu prices, potentially driving away customers.",
      "\"They don't necessarily have the ability to bid up wages, so it might be that those places just shut down because they don't have the labor,\" Brown said.",
      "\"Removing large numbers of immigrants would drastically reduce the labor force, which could lead to rising wages, but potentially just higher prices for food, building and repairing homes, hotel stays and more things Americans hope to see lower prices for,\" added Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "That's because there are some jobs where even higher pay generally fails to attract U.S. born workers, like farming. \"Wages might not rise and instead we'd just see a short-term lack of availability of workers for harvesting crops,\" she said.",
      "Bier of the Cato Institute notes that removing undocumented workers could also have a ripple effect on legally employed workers. For example, the construction industry has an estimated 2 million undocumented workers, but their bosses are mostly Americans.",
      "\"A lot of immigrants do jobs that support jobs held by Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"The same thing is true in hospitality. Americans are more likely to be in management and supervisory roles, so if you pull a bunch of workers you're supervising, there will be fewer jobs for those supervisors and you'll see everyone leveling down,\" Bier added. \"The economic effects are going to be much more diffuse than people expect.\"",

      "The team mapped a surprisingly complex weather system on the planet by tracking the speed of molecules \u2014 they observed a double peak, indicating that one side of the atmosphere is moving towards us and the other away from us at high speed. This indicates that there is a powerful wind current going around the planet.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is preparing to travel to Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala and other Central American countries, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The trip, expected to be his first overseas as the top U.S. envoy, will include a stop in Panama to meet with leaders there as President Trump is calling for the U.S. to retake operational control of the Panama Canal. His stops in other Central American counties are likely to focus on establishing formal agreements with those countries to take back nationals deported from the U.S. as part of new Trump administration immigration policy that is expected to result in a significant uptick in deportations. Several Latin American governments, including Guatemala, have signaled they are open to establish new agreements.",
      "Rubio's confirmation this week as the first Latino Secretary of State has been closely tracked across the hemisphere by governments intrigued by his ascension and eager to earn more attention from American officials, especially its top diplomat with a personal connection to the region and a long work history of public criticism towards communist and socialist governments.",
      "One person familiar with the planning, granted anonymity to speak candidly about ongoing planning, said Rubio \"is probably coming not next week but the first week of February.\"",
      "The government of Panama has not announced any expected visit but its president has issued sharply-worded statements ahead of and on Inauguration Day refuting President Trump's claim that China is now controlling the Panama Canal. He vowed the key transit point would stay under Panamanian control and the U.S. would not retake it.",
      "The trip to Panama comes as Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address that former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, \"foolishly\" returned control of the Canal to Panama.",
      "\"We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\"",

    "story": [
      "A teenager who stabbed three young girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England was sentenced Thursday to more than 50 years in prison for what a judge called \"the most extreme, shocking and exceptionally serious crime.\"",
      "Judge Julian Goose said 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana \"wanted to try and carry out mass murder of innocent, happy young girls.\"",
      "Goose said that he couldn't impose a sentence of life without parole, because Rudakubana was under 18 when he committed the crime.",
      "But the judge said he must serve 52 years, minus the six months he's been in custody, before being considered for parole, and \"it is likely he will never be released.\"",
      "Rudakubana was 17 when he attacked the children in the seaside town of Southport in July, killing Alice Da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. He wounded eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, along with teacher Leanne Lucas and John Hayes, a local businessman who intervened.",
      "The attack shocked the country and set off both street violence and soul-searching. The government has announced a public inquiry into how the system failed to stop the killer, who had been referred to the authorities multiple times over his obsession with violence.",
      "Rudakubana faced three counts of murder, 10 of attempted murder and additional charges of possessing a knife, the poison ricin and an al-Qaida manual. He unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty on all charges on Monday.",
      "But he wasn't in court to hear sentence passed on Thursday.",
      "Hours earlier he had been led into the dock at Liverpool Crown Court in northwest England, dressed in a gray prison tracksuit. But as prosecutors began outlining the evidence, Rudakubana interrupted by shouting that he felt ill and wanted to see a paramedic.",
      "Goose ordered the accused to be removed when he continued shouting. A person in the courtroom shouted \"Coward!\" as Rudakubana was taken out.",
      "The hearing continued without him.",
      "Prosecutor Deanna Heer described how the attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when 26 little girls were \"gathered around the tables making bracelets and singing along to Taylor Swift songs.\"",
      "Rudakubana, armed with a large knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher.",
      "The court was shown video of the suspect arriving at the Hart Space venue in a taxi and entering the building. Within seconds, screams erupted and children ran outside in panic, some of them wounded. One girl made it to the doorway, but was pulled back inside by the attacker. She was stabbed 32 times but survived.",
      "Gasps and sobs could be heard in court as the videos played.",
      "Heer said two of the dead children \"suffered particularly horrific injuries which are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.\" One of the dead girls had 122 injuries, while another suffered 85 wounds.",
      "The prosecutor said Rudakubana had \"a longstanding obsession with violence, killing, genocide.\"",
      "\"His only purpose was to kill. And he targeted the youngest and most vulnerable in society,\" she said, as relatives of the victims watched on in the courtroom.",
      "Heer said that when he was taken to a police station, Rudakubana was heard to say: \"It's a good thing those children are dead, I'm so glad, I'm so happy.\"",
      "The killings triggered days of anti-immigrant violence across the country after far-right activists seized on incorrect reports that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the U.K. Some suggested the crime was a jihadi attack, and alleged that police and the government were withholding information.",
      "Rudakubana was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Christian parents from Rwanda, and investigators haven't been able to pin down his motivation. Police found documents about subjects including Nazi Germany, the Rwandan genocide and car bombs on his devices.",
      "In the years before the attack, he had been reported to multiple authorities over his violent interests and actions. All of the agencies failed to spot the danger he posed.",
      "In 2019, he phoned a children's advice line to ask \"What should I do if I want to kill somebody?\" He said he had taken a knife to school because he wanted to kill someone who was bullying him. Two months later, he attacked a fellow student with a hockey stick and was convicted of assault.",
      "Prosecutors said Rudakubana was referred three times to the government's anti-extremism program, Prevent, when he was 13 and 14 \u2014 once after researching school shootings in class, then for uploading pictures of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to Instagram and for researching a London terror attack.",
      "But they concluded his crimes should not be classed as terrorism because Rudakubana had no discernable political or religious cause. Heer said \"his purpose was the commission of mass murder, not for a particular end, but as an end in itself.\"",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said this week the country must face up to a \"new threat\" from violent individuals whose mix of motivations test the traditional definition of terrorism.",
      "\"After one of the most harrowing moments in our country's history, we owe it to these innocent young girls and all those affected to deliver the change that they deserve,\" Starmer said after the sentencing.",
      "Several relatives and survivors read emotional statements in court, describing how the attack had shattered their lives.",
      "Lucas, 36, who ran the dance class, said that \"the trauma of being both a victim and a witness has been horrendous.\"",
      "\"I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died?\" she said.",
      "A 14-year-old survivor, who can't be named because of a court order, said that while she was physically recovering. \"we will all have to live with the mental pain from that day forever.\"",
      "\"I hope you spend the rest of your life knowing that we think you're a coward,\" she said.",
      "The prosecutor read out a statement from the parents of Alice Da Silva Aguiar, who said their daughter's killing had \"shattered our souls.\"",
      "\"We used to cook for three. Now we only cook for two. It doesn't seem right,\" they said. \"Alice was our purpose for living, so what do we do now?\"",

    "story": [
      "The chief prosecutor of the United Nations' International Criminal Court announced Thursday that he was seeking arrest warrants for the two most senior leaders of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime for crimes against humanity over the group's treatment of women and girls.",
      "Prosecutor Karim Khan said that after a thorough investigation and review of evidence, his office found \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that Taliban Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and the group's Chief Justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani bear \"criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds,\" under the treaty that founded the ICC, known as the Rome Statute.",
      "Khan said his office had concluded that both men are \"criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women, as well as persons whom the Taliban perceived as not conforming with their ideological expectations of gender identity or expression, and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women.\"",
      "The statement said the alleged crimes were committed between \"at least\" from the Taliban's retaking of control over Afghanistan in August 2021 \"until the present day,\" all across the country.",
      "\"This ongoing persecution entails numerous severe deprivations of victims' fundamental rights, contrary to international law, including the right to physical integrity and autonomy, to free movement and free expression, to education, to private and family life, and to free assembly,\" said Khan.",
      "There was no immediate reaction to Khan's request by Taliban leadership.",
      "Since regaining control of Afghanistan, the Taliban has imposed a long list of harsh laws targeting women and girls. The measures have seen women pushed out of public life and drawn condemnation from much of the international community, including allegations of gender-based apartheid.",
      "Under the pretext of Islamic Sharia law, the measures have deprived girls and women of formal education from the age of 12, the right to visit public parks or travel alone, or even to meet with a doctor unless accompanied by a male chaperone.",
      "Last month, the Taliban imposed a ban on women training to become midwives and nurses \u2014 another devastating blow in a country that already has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. According to data from the World Bank, 620 women die for every 100,000 live births in Afghanistan due to pregnancy-related complications.",

      "organization Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Thursday that she hoped the request for ICC warrants against the senior Taliban figures would put the group's \"systematic exclusion of women and girls from public life and targeting of LGBT people back on the international community's radar.\"",
      "Evenson said the Taliban's gender-based repression had \"accelerated with complete impunity\" since the summer of 2021, and that \"with no justice in sight in Afghanistan, the warrant requests offer an essential pathway to a measure of accountability.\"",
      "She also called on the ICC prosecutor to revisit his decision \"to deprioritize investigation of abuses by the forces of the former Afghan government and U.S. personnel\" who were based in the country for two decades. The probe into the actions of U.S. troops was launched by Khan's predecessor.",
      "Khan said the request for international arrest warrants highlights the ICC's commitment to holding those responsible for gender-based crimes accountable, with more arrests and warrant fillings for other senior Taliban members expected to follow as the court's investigation into the situation in Afghanistan continues.",
      "\"The judges of the International Criminal Court will now determine whether these applications for arrest warrants establish reasonable grounds to believe that the named individuals committed the alleged crimes. If the judges issue the warrants, my Office will work closely with the Registrar in all efforts to arrest the individuals,\" Khan said, adding that, \"as in all situations, I request States Parties to fully cooperate with the Court and help it in enforcing any judicial order.\"",
      "While the ICC has the power to issue arrest warrants \u2014 and has done so recently for both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's former defense chief and a senior Hamas leader \u2014 it does not have any means of independently enforcing such warrants.",
      "It is down to individual countries that are signatories to the court's founding treaty to decide whether to take wanted individuals into custody on ICC warrants, as and when they enter those country's territories.",
      "The United States is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, and is thus not obligated to detain anyone on an ICC warrant.",
      "Even if the ICC does issue warrants for Akhundzada or other Taliban leaders, it is highly unlikely that they would try to visit any country where they could risk arrest. Virtually the entire world has declined to acknowledge the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government in the wake of their reassertion of control over the country.",
      "Khan himself has faced accusations that he tried for more than a year to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her against her will.

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 09:55:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Israel says troops fired on masked gunmen in Gaza, but it remains committed to the ceasefire as it continues a new offensive in the West Bank.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Testing the bounds of a fragile ceasefire in its fifth day, Israel's military said Thursday that forces had opened fire in the southern Gaza Strip on masked, armed suspects who posed a threat to their safety. The Israel Defense Forces, in a statement, reported incidents east of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, and in the area of the Kerem Shalom border crossing, through which aid trucks have been delivering more food, water and medical supplies since the ceasefire took effect.",
      "The IDF said it had killed one militant with the Islamic Jihad group and that while Israel remained \"determined to fully maintain the terms of the [ceasefire] agreement in order to return the hostages,\" it was also \"prepared for any scenario and will continue to take all necessary actions to thwart any immediate threat to IDF soldiers.\"",
      "There was no immediate response to the incident from Gaza's Hamas rulers.",
      "Hours before the IDF confirmed the operation in southern Gaza, newly-sworn-in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and told the Israeli leader that \"maintaining the United States' steadfast support for Israel is a top priority for President Trump,\" according to a readout of the call.",
      "Rubio made a series of calls to foreign ministers around the world, but Netanyahu was the first head of state he spoke with, according to readouts provided by the State Department. The two men also discussed freeing the remaining 94 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, of whom seven are Israeli-Americans, and addressing threats from Iran, though the State Department offered no specifics.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry has not reported any new deaths since the ceasefire took hold, but the official toll has continued to rise as rescue and recovery teams, and ordinary citizens, find more bodies and, in some cases, piles of bones, in the rubble of the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "The ministry said that, as of Thursday, its tally showed more than 47,200 people had been killed during the war that was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which saw militants kill approximately 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others. In Gaza, the remains of more than 160 people have been recovered since the ceasefire began on Sunday, the ministry said.",
      "Thousands more bodies are still believed to be under collapsed buildings in the enclave, which was home to some 2.3 million people before the war. The media office of Gaza's Hamas-run administration said Thursday that about 14,000 people remained missing.",
      "Faster recovery efforts, along with the distribution of aid, have been hampered due to a lack of functioning heavy equipment in the strip and its decimated infrastructure, according to rescue workers and aid agencies.",
      "As of Wednesday, the U.N. said 808 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, including food, fuel and medical supplies, had entered the strip since the ceasefire took effect. But the ceasefire and hostage release agreement negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt called for 600 trucks to enter the territory every day.",
      "Hamas has said it will release four more hostages \u2014 Israeli women \u2014 on Saturday. The initial exchange on Sunday saw three captives set free in exchange for about 90 Palestinian prisoners, who were let out of an Israeli prison in the occupied West Bank. Israel is expected to free 200 more Palestinian detainees in the next exchange this weekend.",
      "Meanwhile, a \"large-scale\" military offensive launched by the IDF in the West Bank earlier this week continued overnight, focused in and around the sprawling Jenin refugee camp in the north of the Palestinian territory.",
      "The IDF says it has killed two men in the \"Iron Wall\" operation who were linked to the Hamas-allied Islamic Jihad group, claiming the men shot and killed three Israelis in a bus attack two weeks ago in the West Bank.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank, which is not controlled by Hamas like Gaza, said Wednesday that 10 Palestinians had been killed amid the IDF's new operation.",
      "\"Iron Wall\" has been a major show of force by the IDF in Jenin, an area of the West Bank long considered by Israel to be a stronghold of Iranian-backed militant groups. Since the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, the IDF has redirected its focus \u2014 and firepower \u2014 to the West Bank.",
      "One of President Trump's many initial moves as he began his second term this week was to withdraw Biden-era sanctions imposed on Israeli settlers deemed a threat to security in the West Bank.",
      "Domestically, for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the West Bank offensive may be aimed at least partly at placating a segment of his support base \u2014 including far-right members of his own cabinet \u2014 who have been infuriated by the ceasefire deal with Hamas.",
      "Israel's former National Security Minister, the right-wing nationalist Itamar Ben-Gvir, resigned in protest over the deal, saying it was giving in to terror.",
      "If the country's Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right cabinet member, were to resign, then Netanyahu's fragile coalition government would fall apart. Early national elections would then have to be called in the country, which could imperil Netanyahu's own long grip on political power.",

      "Mr. Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said.",
      "The readout didn't elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which were the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports, as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump's call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first such call to be reported.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Mr. Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017.",
      "\"The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Mr. Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \"If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 - we'll up it for all the inflation - I think I'd probably go.\"",
      "The 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom.",
      "Mr. Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",
      "The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues.",
      "Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia's western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars' worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Britain's Prince Harry has settled his lawsuit against the U.K. newspaper group owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, News Group Newspapers, his lawyer told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Harry and a former senior U.K. lawmaker sued News Group in 2019 over alleged unlawful activities carried out by both tabloid journalists and private investigators employed by its newspapers The Sun and the no-longer-in-circulation News of the World. It was one of a number of lawsuits Harry has brought against newspapers in Britain.",
      "\"NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun,\" the media company said in a statement read out in court Wednesday. The statement also included an apology for the activities of journalists and private investigators working for the News of the World.",
      "\"NGN further apologizes to the Duke for the impact on him of the extensive coverage and serious intrusion into his private life as well as the private life of Diana, Princess of Wales, his late mother, in particular during his younger years. We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the Duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships and family, and have agreed to pay him substantial damages,\" the statement said.",
      "News Group has faced numerous lawsuits over allegations of phone hacking and illegal information gathering, and it has settled more that 1,300 involving politicians and celebrities. It has always denied, however, that The Sun newspaper was involved in any illegal activities, or that senior figures were aware of anything illegal and tried to cover it up.",
      "Harry had previously said he wanted to go to trial to get to the truth, rather than to get a payout, after other claimants settled out of court.",
      "In court documents that emerged in 2023, Prince Harry claimed that his own brother, heir to the British throne Prince William, quietly received \"a very large sum of money\" in a 2020 phone hacking settlement with Murdoch's U.K. newspaper group.",
      "\"After endless resistance, denials and legal battles by News Group Newspapers, including spending more than a billion pounds in payouts and in legal costs (as well as paying-off those in the know) to prevent the full picture from coming out, News UK is finally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law,\" said a statement read outside the court Wednesday on behalf of Prince Harry and the British lawmaker who brought the suit with him. \"The truth that has now been exposed is that NGN unlawfully engaged more than 100 private investigators over at least 16 years on more than 35,000 occasions. This happened as much at The Sun as it did at the News of the World, with the knowledge of all the Editors and executives, going to the very top of the company.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Emma Jones, a board member of the advocacy group Hacked Off, which has worked with Harry on his lawsuit, said proceedings had been scheduled to resume that morning, but that both sides had appealed for extra time as the settlement talks were underway.",
      "Jones said a \"huge amount of money is going to be passing hands,\" but she said she did not know the exact amount.",
      "She said Harry also wanted \"some sort of admission\u2026 that implicates NGN (News Group). An admission, in a way, of what went on,\" Jones said.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 08:56:44 -0500",
    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe must \"wake up\" and spend more on its defense as Trump returns, but how realistic is the suggestion?",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump cemented his return to the White House, French President Emmanuel Macron told his European counterparts\u00a0this week to \"wake up\" and spend more on the continent's defense to reduce the continent's reliance on the United States for security.",
      "\"What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?\" Macron said Monday, addressing members of the French military.",
      "President Trump has often criticized America's NATO allies for failing to meet domestic defense spending targets. At a February 2024 campaign rally in South Carolina, he said he'd encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO allies who don't meet the target.",
      "In the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump repeated a demand he first made in January that NATO \"needs to pay 5%.\" Under a 2014 agreement made by the group, the alliance's more than 30 member states committed to aim to spend at least 2% of the value of their domestic economies on defense every year. During his first term in office, Mr. Trump pressured America's allies to meet that threshold, and some have increased their military spending since that time, but many still do not make the 2% bar.",
      "In his remarks just two days after the U.S. election in November, Macron called on Europeans \"to believe in our sovereignty and strategic autonomy\" and to decrease reliance on U.S. military hardware and defense leadership.",
      "CBS News has spoken with analysts and former officials from several European countries and NATO following the U.S. election. The experts, from Poland, Italy, Germany, the U.K. and the NATO alliance itself, vary in their assessments of the feasibility of Macron's broad vision, but they largely agree that Europe can and should cooperate more closely and spend more money on defense.",
      "The direct quotes below have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Poland - Professor Katarzyna Pisarska",
      "Chair, Warsaw Security Forum",
      "Speaking on Macron's comments:",
      "You have to remember that Macron's vision is not really a detail-oriented, ready-to-go project. It is an idea that has been discussed in Europe, and throughout the last two years, but the general direction is that we are not building anything that would be competitive to NATO. Rather, we would be creating capabilities, especially defense capabilities, that would help and strengthen the European defense pillar of NATO.",
      "The idea that we would go alone without the United States has been rejected by almost all, if not all, EU and NATO member states.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "Poland currently buys 80% of all its military stocks from the United States. It's heavily dependent on American air missile defense systems. These are not things that you can detangle or unbundle from overnight. So the majority of countries \u2014 especially from the NATO eastern flank \u2014 will tell you we will absolutely not go alone without the United States. There is no way that France, and even less so Germany, can step up to deliver the type of technological capabilities that are needed to substitute for the Americans on the ground here in Europe.",
      "Discussion has moved in the direction that it has been moving pre-Trump election: Europe has to step up with NATO, start producing more, start spending more, also developing its own capabilities. We also need to have a number of different defense elements that we procure and create by ourselves, and that should be also understandable to our American partners, although when I spoke with congressmen in April, not all of them understood that it is okay for Europeans to spend money on European equipment and not only on American or Korean equipment.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "Maybe President Emmanuel Macron has some idea since [the U.S. election] that he can yet again push the idea that European strategic autonomy is really complete independent from the United States. But I will say it again: From countries that are on the forefront of this war [in Ukraine], for countries that will have to be the first battleground of this war, which is the NATO eastern flank, that is not negotiable.",
      "We will have to do more and we will be doing more. I think what is unclear in the United States is that Europe already delivers 50% of military aid to Ukraine and 90% of financial and refugee aid to Ukraine. So stepping up has already happened to a large extent.",
      "It has to happen more. We need to have more troops. We have to be prepared to defend ourselves, but having America as an ally, not a competitor, I think this is what is very important to understand.",
      "U.K. - Alistair Burt",
      "Former Member of U.K. Parliament and minister of state for the Middle East at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and minister of state at the Department for International Development",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "We have known for some time that the United States, under whatever leadership, would be asking Europeans to spend more on their defense, and what Trump's election has done has catalyzed that now. I think you have to take people at their word, and what Trump has said about NATO in the past and what people have said about European defense, rings true. I think he's [Macron] making the point that in the end, it's up to us. You're either a supplicant or you're making the weather. And there's no reason why we should just roll over and take the world as President Trump is going to try and define it. It will still, I'm absolutely certain, be in the interests of the West to act together, but we cannot take that for granted any longer, and I think Macron is right to seize upon it.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "I noticed that Macron's speech sort of offered the invitation to those outside the EU to be part of this wider European political community that the United Kingdom has made very clear it intends to be part of. I think the United Kingdom does have a role to play in this. Clearly our military is a very important part of NATO and will always be, but I would very much believe it is in the United Kingdom's interest to act with the wider European community. It bolsters them, strengthens them, and it's in our own interests. We at least have begun to spend more on defense. Other states will have more catching up to do but I do see it in the U.K.'s political and economic and military interests to be active in relation to what Macron has been saying.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "All the rhetoric has been absolutely right, we cannot afford to let Russia win. You have the Baltic states very anxious, you have [countries] with Russian enclaves that could allow Putin to say, there are Russian people here, so we will defend their interests just as we purported to do in Ukraine. How would [those countries] feel if there was some sense that Ukraine was not being supported?",
      "On the other hand, if you take out the United States' economic and military support that is asking a great deal of the rest of us to make up. I think the rhetoric is very, very clear, in that everybody has said we will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes, and there can't be any weakening in that. The moment you've got any possibility of that weakening, then you're effectively giving the game away.",
      "If there is to be some sort of U.S.-brokered negotiation [for Ukraine], clearly [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy wants to be in the strongest possible position. And to do that, he's got to be able to enter those negotiations with the clear determination of the rest of Europe behind him to say whatever happens, we won't let you down, but if it goes on for two, four, five years, who knows?",
      "I don't think Europe can say anything other than what it's saying, and again, I think you have to take us at our word.",
      "NATO - Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff",
      "Former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "Let's nail this for once and for all: There is one effective military alliance in Europe - a political-military alliance in Europe, in the trans-Atlantic region \u2014 and it's called NATO. NATO has a command structure. It has a doctrine. It practices regularly. It is used to moving and commanding military forces at real scale. What is the point of trying to create something where we've got 70 years, 75 years of experience with NATO? Now, of course, the problem is, what happens if America, under Trump, either pulls out of NATO, which is unlikely, or reduces its support to NATO, which is possible?",
      "The solution to that, frankly, is not to start blathering on about new formations under the European Union. It's to lean into NATO and damn well start spending money. Why is Trump and why are America likely to pull a rug from under NATO, if they do? Because the French, the Germans, the British, the Spanish, the Italians, have simply not pulled their weight in defense spending terms for most of the 75 years of NATO's existence, or certainly, at least the last, certainly the last 30 years. So, lean into NATO and really double down on NATO and double down on defense spending.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "There is one good thing, though, that the European Union can do, which is defense industries. If they can get a grip of European defense procurement in order to offset the current dependence on the Americans in order to standardize weaponry. It is ridiculous for the British to continue with its own cottage industry of making tanks, when actually the rest of Europe buys Leopard IIs, which is a perfectly good tank, from Rheinmetall [in Germany].",
      "This is going to require some real political boldness, and it is going to require a pooling and a sharing of sovereignty. It's going to require individual nations like Britain to say, okay, we're not going to make a tank. We'll buy the Leopard II.",
      "On NATO:",
      "If you start building large numbers of European [non-NATO] headquarters, they've got to come from somewhere - a European command structure. What it means is that NATO will suffer. You know, I was the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, one of many Brits that go back to Montgomery. The Germans have the Chief of Staff. The Chairman of the Military Committee is a Dutchman at the moment, and he or she rotates the commanders of the joint force commands. Europe has a leading role in NATO. Europeans have leading roles in NATO. But it all comes down to really leaning in and being able to produce the troop numbers, the ships, the planes, that NATO needs to really provide an effective deterrence.",
      "Germany - Norbert Roetgen",
      "Former Chair, Bundestag (German parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "I think this definitely now is the hour of Europe, a European moment, when we have to prepare that, quite probably, America, under the Trump presidency, will stop any financial or military support for Ukraine. But perhaps we also are going to see the attempt to strike a deal between Trump and Putin, so this now means that European security definitely has to become European. So either we stand up or we give up.",
      "However, I think we, the Europeans, are not prepared, despite all the evidence that this had to be expected. Europeans are not prepared, so we have to quickly catch up. It's possible, and the political will is what is lacking most, but we will have to act in a very pragmatic way.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "We have to act in a very pragmatic way to quickly and more substantially support Ukraine, and this means that we have to compensate for the American support in terms of weapons and ammunition delivery and, in the short term, this would mean that the Europeans would have to buy weapons and ammunition on the international market, and in the mid- and longer term we will have to enhance our capabilities to better coordinate, to create bigger markets in order to scale our economies in the area of defense.",
      "Up to now, there is no sufficient political will to do what is necessary to support Ukraine in order to enable Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression. Otherwise, the military situation on the battleground would be different. We are going to see that the United States is not contributing as they have done in the past, so there is a lack of political will, and there is only one way to change this course, and this is by doing more.",
      "This would mean that all European member states like Poland, Germany and France come together and invite other countries; for example, Britain\u2014 we should go beyond the EU because it's about the entire European architecture of security\u2014 come together. And when they come together, they should bring with them substantial additional contributions in terms of money and in terms of weapons and ammunition, and this should be done in the short term. And then they should devise a plan on how to make this a structured effort and what is necessary to be done to better coordinate, to enhance the support necessary for the defense of Ukraine. It should be done very substantially in terms of money and weapons. There are no further words needed. What is needed are deeds.",
      "On NATO:",
      "Of course, it's in the European strategic interest to be a strong part of NATO, to keep the Americans in Europe. This is not against anybody, but it is only to contribute in a stronger way to what is at the heart and what is the core of NATO, and that is European security.",
      "Italy - Natalie Tocci",
      "Director, Istituto Affari Internazionali, and former special adviser to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "He's been saying this for a long time, and in a sense the vision was right back then, and it's even more right now. He started talking about European strategic autonomy in 2017, and there wasn't a lot of appetite and traction behind the idea, given that it has traditionally been mistakenly interpreted as something that runs counter to the transatlantic relationship. So obviously now with Trump, a good idea that was good back then becomes politically relevant today.",
      "From the general concept of the idea to the action, there's a big gap, and he hasn't put forward any new concrete ideas in that respect.",
      "Generally what tends to happen is Macron says something, everyone else criticizes him, but no one really puts forward an alternative vision. So God bless Macron for at least kind of having an idea, and I think in this particular case it's even a good idea, and I do think that the election of Donald Trump is going to galvanize some action, but I'm very skeptical that the kind of action that is going to be insufficient relative to what we have to do.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "We're basically talking about 100 billion euros a year ($104 billion) for several years alongside all member states beginning to spend between 2-and-4% of GDP. This is not going to happen overnight.",
      "There's no antagonism between the EU and NATO, because, frankly speaking, as we're in the midst of a war, we can't really afford to have sort of academic conversations about the EU and NATO. What the EU can contribute is on providing the regulatory and financial incentives for Europeans to do more on defense together.",
      "However, I think there is a lot there to be worked on, and especially if some of these countries begin or increasingly pursue projects collectively. If you think about France, Italy on air defense, think about the Italian-German project on a new tank, there's a lot there that can be worked on.",
      "Does it mean that Europeans would have all defense capacities? Probably not, or certainly not in the short term, so there's still a lot of dependence on the US and US defense industry.",
      "This is not a question of just completely being self-reliant on your own defense industry, but certainly there's a lot more the European defense industry can do and a lot more that governments can do to support that consolidation and cooperation within the defense industry in Europe.",

      "In a statement released by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said IDF and police forces \"launched an extensive and significant military operation to eradicate terrorism in Jenin.\"",
      "Dubbing the operation \"Iron Wall,\" Netanyahu called it \"another step towards achieving the goal we set \u2014 strengthening security\" in the West Bank and acting \"methodically and resolutely against the Iranian axis wherever it sends its arms.\"",
      "Throughout the 15-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Jenin has been a focus of Israeli raids into the occupied territory. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, launched its own raid into the area late last year.",
      "Violence in the West Bank has surged during the war in Gaza, with Israel saying it is operating to stamp out Iranian-backed militancy. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 800 people have been killed in Israeli raids in the West Bank there since the war began after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Several Israelis have also been killed recently in attacks by Palestinians.",
      "The IDF launched its new operation hours after President Trump rescinded Biden-era executive orders that had authorized U.S. sanctions against people who undermine peace in the occupied West Bank, mainly targeting Israeli settlers",
      "The Biden administration used the executive order to impose a handful of sanctions on extremist settlers accused of using violence against Palestinians who live in the West Bank.",
      "Israeli settlements and smaller outposts across the West Bank are illegal under international law. The U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice, ruled last summer that Israel should stop settlement activity and end what it called the \"illegal\" occupation \u2014 a ruling that was not legally binding, and which was condemned by the Israeli government.",
      "Settlers have celebrated the incoming Trump administration, believing it will take a more favorable approach to illegal settlements in the Palestinian territory.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel's territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.",
      "After Mr. Trump's reelection in November, Israel's far-right minister of finance suggested the country would look to annex the occupied West Bank in 2025.",
      "Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a member of Israel's far-right Religious Zionist Party, said at the time that he believed Israel could work with the second Trump administration to promote annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I am convinced that we will be able to work closely together with President-elect Trump and all members of the incoming administration, to promote the common values and interests of the two countries, to strengthen the strength and security of the State of Israel, to expand the circle of peace and stability in the Middle East out of strength and faith and on the basis of recognition in the unquestionable historical belonging of the whole Land of Israel to the people of Israel,\" he said in a social media post.",
      "The settlements seen as a barrier to a potential two-state solution, the longstanding U.S.-backed policy that envisions the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, because the more Israeli Jews live in the occupied territory, the less likely it seems that Israel would ever abandon control of the land for it to become part of a Palestinian state.",

    "summary": "The world reacts as President Trump moves to pull the U.S. out of the WHO and the Paris Climate Accords on Day 1 of his second term.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 In President Trump's speech after he was sworn into office for a second term Monday, he outlined a number of policies that would change the U.S.' relationship with the rest of the world. In addition to immediately clamping down on immigration across the southern border, Mr. Trump signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "While some international leaders congratulated Mr. Trump, others were unhappy with his first actions as president. Below is a look at reactions from around the world to Mr. Trump's initial moves.",
      "Reaction to Trump announcement on U.S. withdrawal from WHO",
      "The WHO is the United Nations agency responsible for global public health. It has nearly 200 member states and plays a lead role in coordinating international responses to disease outbreaks and other health matters. Mr. Trump's announcement started a year-long notice period for the U.S. to formally withdraw from the WHO and halt all financial contributions to the body.",
      "Speaking Monday, Mr. Trump accused the WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, saying the agency had failed to act free of \"inappropriate political influence of WHO member states\" and had required \"unfairly onerous payments\" from the U.S., disproportionate to what some other, larger countries, such as China, were paying.",
      "\"The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the Organization,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,\" Tedros said. \"We hope the United States will reconsider and we look forward to engaging in constructive dialogue to maintain the partnership between the USA and WHO, for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Germany's health minister as saying Tuesday that Berlin would try to convince Mr. Trump to change his mind on the WHO, while China's foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters \"the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.\"",
      "\"China will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,\" spokesman Guo Jiakun said, according to the AFP news agency, adding that Beijing would \"work towards building a shared community of health for humanity.\"",
      "Reaction to Trump saying U.S. will pull out of Paris Climate Accords",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's announcement that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Climate Accords \u2014 a move that will take a year to complete and that he initiated during his first term, too \u2014 U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said anyone not embracing clean energy would miss out on \"massive profits, millions of manufacturing jobs and clean air.\"",
      "The Paris agreement is a legally binding treaty to address climate change that was adopted by 196 parties in 2015. Its goal is to prevent \"the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\" and try \"to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\"",
      "\"Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse, destroying property and businesses, hitting nationwide food production, and driving economy-wide price inflation,\" Stiell said, according to Reuters, adding that there was still room for the new Trump administration to change course.",
      "\"The door remains open to the Paris agreement, and we welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries,\" Stiell said.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union's governing European Commission, said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Europe would \"stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.\"",
      "She vowed that the the 27-nation EU bloc would adhere to the terms and goals of the Paris agreement, which she said \"continues to be the best hope for all humanity.\"",
      "\"Unusual fear\" in Europe",
      "Georgios Samaras, a lecturer in public policy at King's College London, said European leaders would need to decide how to position themselves in regard to Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "\"I've spoken to colleagues in the European Union, and there is unusual fear right now in the commission, because they don't know what's next,\" Samaras told CBS News. \"I believe that Trump is going to choose his allies very carefully, and those who don't bend the knee will face the consequences of Trump's agenda.\"",
      "\"The EU will either find a way to communicate with Trump or, similarly, they might be targeted,\" he predicted.",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened the EU with tariffs, but Von der Leyen sent him her \"best wishes.\"",
      "\"The EU looks forward to working closely with you to tackle global challenges,\" the EU leader said in a social media post. \"Together, our societies can achieve greater prosperity and strengthen their common security. This is the enduring strength of the transatlantic partnership.\"",
      "Reaction from other global voices to Trump's inauguration",
      "The initial reactions from many world leaders were congratulatory, despite simmering tension between Mr. Trump and some longstanding U.S. allies.",
      "\"For centuries, the relationship between our two nations has been one of collaboration, cooperation and enduring partnership,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been repeatedly attacked in recent weeks by Trump appointee Elon Musk on social media, said. \"With President Trump's longstanding affection and historical ties to the United Kingdom, I know that depth of friendship will continue.\"",
      "In his final days in office, former President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsored terrorism. Mr. Trump immediately reversed that move, which Cuba's president Miquel Diaz-Canal called, \"an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.\"",
      "Mr. Trump again threatened in his inaugural address to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino responded shortly after his speech, reiterating in a statement that \"the Canal is and will continue being Panamanian, and its administration will continue being under Panama's control with respect to its permanent neutrality.\"",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Mr. Trump's executive orders paving the way for U.S. troops to be sent to the southern border and designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum said that the orders were similar to policies under Mr. Trump's previous administrations and that Mexico was, therefore, prepared.",
      "\"They can act in their territories within the framework of their constitution. What we say is: Stay away from our sovereignty, from our independence. We can coordinate, but we are a free, independent and sovereign country and we are going to seek coordination,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "She also criticized Mr. Trump's order to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "\"For us and for the whole world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump did not immediately impose new tariffs on China, as he'd indicated he might, and he recently delayed a ban on Chinese-owned TikTok that was conceived under his previous administration and passed under Biden's administration.",
      "\"China stands ready to work with the new U.S. government under the strategic guidance of the two presidents,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Guo said Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. \"Economic ties between China and the US are essentially mutually beneficial despite differences and disputes. China believes there is space for cooperation and dialogue in this trade area and both countries can engage in more talks.\"",
      "In a video statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that \"the best days of our alliance are yet to come.\"",
      "\"Your first term as President was filled with groundbreaking moments,\" Netanyahu said. \"I'm confident that we will complete the defeat of Iran's terror axis and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for our region.\"",
      "In Iran, the semi-official student news agency cited the country's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Kazem Gharibabadi as saying Tehran, as in the past, was ready to engage in direct negotiations with the new U.S. administration with the aim of getting sanctions lifted.",
      "\"If there will be also the same intention on the other side, the talks will take place and can reach a conclusion,\" Gharibabadi said.",
      "On the streets of Tehran, Iranians who spoke with CBS News voiced apprehension, given Mr. Trump's previous hard line on policy regarding their country and the devastating impact of the sanctions already in place.",
      "Kimia, a 26-year-old art graduate who declined to give her full name told CBS News that she hoped Mr. Trump would resume his \"maximum pressure\" tactic against her country's leaders, to force it to change its domestic policies and allocate more resources for the good of the Iranian people \"rather than other countries.\"",
      "But others voiced hope that Mr. Trump might usher new negotiations with Iran's relatively new, reform-minded\u00a0President Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "\"This time, I believe President Trump and Iranian President Mr. Pezeshkian can have a positive negotiation, and there is hope that it will end up well for the Iranian people,\" said Mayan, a 29-year-old master student in Tehran.",
      "At a Russian security council meeting hours before Mr. Trump was sworn in, President Vladimir Putin praised the new administration for aiming to restore direct communication channels that Moscow says the Biden White House interrupted.",
      "\"Naturally, we welcome this stance and extend our congratulations to the President-elect of the United States of America on his inauguration,\" Putin said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also congratulated Mr. Trump on Monday.",
      "\"President Trump is always decisive, and the peace through strength policy he announced provides an opportunity to strengthen American leadership and achieve a long-term and just peace, which is the top priority,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "It is unclear how Mr. Trump will handle the war in Ukraine after vowing on the campaign trail to end the conflict there quickly. The U.S. has been providing huge amounts of military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In a separate video message, Zelenskyy said the new American administration offered a good opportunity to achieve peace.",

      "Deep-sea sea bugs, or the Bathynomus\u00a0species, have been eaten regularly in Vietnam since 2017, according to the researchers, who published their findings in the science journal ZooKeys. The crustaceans, members of the isopod family, are fished from deep water, usually in the South China Sea, and sold in restaurants and other eateries. The study was exploring the sudden popularity of the crustaceans.",

All isopods are characterized by hard, protective exoskeletons and seven pairs of legs, but they're usually incredibly small, about 2.5 centimeters. The new species had evolved to be much larger, around 30 centimeters, the researchers said.

I just noticed that my left testicle had swelled up, and I went to see the doctor, and he said that we needed to do some tests, ultrasound, a blood test. And they discovered that it was at a pretty advanced stage, and did the surgery and\u00a0found that some of the cancer cells had gone through the veins and arteries to the kidneys.\"",

Either curbing runaway production or convincing China, the 2nd largest film market in the world, to expand its quota of imported Hollywood films would be a win for the American film industry.

      "\"This marks a continued (albeit gradual) political shift across Hollywood, in terms of ideology and alignment. The last two prominent, conservatives to come out of the industry: Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the decades since, Hollywood has leaned decided liberal; this arguably peaked during the Obama years, when actors, athletes, and musicians lined up to endorse and support the 44th President of the United States. I wouldn't say this realignment is akin to a light switch (meaning immediate in its pace and effect) but it certainly seems like the early stages of a dimmer switch.\"",

      "He noted that some of the biggest studio leaders in Hollywood, like Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger, weren\u2019t the ones selected for the position, meaning it\u2019s not so much \"a switch in the studio system in those productions, but bringing more of an awareness to those other filmmakers or those filmmakers who may be making outside [films] of the mainstream,\" specifically faith-based productions.",

      "\"At the end of the day, the industry is all about making a profit,\" Duenas added. \"If that type of contest equates to clicks, streams, and butts in seats, Hollywood will shift its content without hesitation.

      "\"I got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised,\" Gibson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can. Any chance the position comes with an Ambassador\u2019s residence?\"",
      "Duenas added, \"Realistically, the ambassadors' involvement could really rub a lot of heavy hitters, including studios, producers, actors, directors, and writers, the wrong way. This could even deepen existing divides within the industry, as Hollywood is very proud of its liberal stance, and the last thing they want is lectures about how to do business from conservatives.\"",
      "Voight was vocal in his support of his new role, declaring he\u2019s seen a \"slow deterioration\" of Hollywood over his nearly seven-decade career.",
      "\"I\u2019m old enough to have touched some years of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and I\u2019ve seen its slow deterioration since,\" he said. \"Today, we are in pretty bad shape. Very few films are made here now, but we are fortunate to have an incoming President who wants to restore Hollywood to its former glory, and with his help, I feel we can get done.\"",

      "The \"Midnight Cowboy\" star\u2019s mention of \"very few films\" being made in Los Angeles has been an ongoing issue following the triple hit of the COVID-19 pandemic, the dual writers and actors strikes in 2023, and now the fires that ravaged large portions of the city.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the industry is all about making a profit. If that type of contest equates to clicks, streams, and butts in seats, Hollywood will shift its content without hesitation.\"",
      "\"Will we see a shift in production location?\" Eldridge said. \"In the immediate sense, yes, but that will be due in large part to the utter devastation caused by the Los Angeles fires. If the Writers Guild strike delayed production by an entire year, there's no telling when Hollywood will get back to 'business as usual' based on the images we've seen on TV over the last week.\"",
      "He continued, \"But the inevitable outsourcing of production won't be caused by the fires themselves; several years ago, states like Georgia and Texas began giving significant tax incentives to filmmakers in order to move production to their states. California might be home to Hollywood, but it's also home to one of the most prohibitive (and arguably, punitive) tax structures in the entire country. We had already seen the beginning of a slow migration of production out of California; I think these fires will only serve to fast-track that creative exodus.\"",

      "\"If there is a switch at the state level government, there may be something that happens there. But even at the state level, I think that's a decision on working with major studios versus your mini studios or even your independent films on what can be done within California versus what is easier to do or cheaper to do or more efficient to do in these other locations.\"",
      "Duenas said, \"While they could advocate for bringing production back to California, I don\u2019t know how much credit they would get, as things are already moving in that direction for 2025. Plans for tax incentives are already in the works to bring more production back from other states and countries, which would be huge for California and the enormous number of people this industry provides income for in the Golden State.\"",

      "\"This matter is in active litigation in federal court. Releasing this video to the media, rather than presenting it as evidence in court, is another example of an unethical attempt to manipulate the public. It is also a continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign. While they are focused on misleading media narratives, we are focused on the legal process. We are continuing our efforts to require Mr. Baldoni and his associates to answer in court, under oath, rather than through manufactured media stunts.\"",
      "\"Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively\u2019s discomfort. They will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching.\"",

      "However, Baldoni insisted Lively \"falsely\" accused him in an attempt to repair her reputation following the fallout around the movie's press tour after she took control of the film.",

And rather than admit and take accountability for her own mishaps, she chose to blame Plaintiffs, in a malicious and unforgivably public manner.\"",
      "\"When she and Reynolds could not force Baldoni and Wayfarer to read a statement she and her representatives prepared, extorting them to \u2018take accountability\u2019 in defense of Lively\u2019s actions, she lay in wait for months, preparing to publicly attack Baldoni by falsely claiming that he had sexually harassed her.\"",
      "Justin Baldoni sued Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds for civil extortion, defamation and more. (Cindy Ord/Getty Images)",
      "Lively's team slammed Baldoni's lawsuit in a statement.",
      "\"This latest lawsuit from Justin Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and its associates is another chapter in the abuser playbook,\" the statement provided by Lively's legal team read. \"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim. This is what experts call DARVO. Deny. Attack. Reverse Victim Offender.\"",
      "The statement continued, in part: \"Their response to sexual harassment allegations: she wanted it, it\u2019s her fault. Their justification for why this happened to her: look what she was wearing.\u00a0In short, while the victim focuses on the abuse, the abuser focuses on the victim. The strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint, and it will fail.\"",

      "\"Obesity is a complex problem and has different significance at the individual level,\" the report's lead author Francesco Rubino, chair of bariatric and metabolic surgery at King\u2019s College London, United Kingdom, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Obesity is a \"spectrum,\" he said, rather than a \"single, distinct clinical entity.\"",

A reboot loop can be caused by an issue with your computer's power supply, a malware infection, overheating or even hardware drivers. Here are the different things to check if your Windows 11 laptop or desktop keeps restarting.",
      "Fix #1 - Boot your PC in safe mode",
      "Step to boot your PC in safe mode (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When you are troubleshooting any problem on your PC, you should boot your computer in safe mode. If your PC is in safe mode and no longer experiences the restart loop, this means that the default Windows 11 settings and drivers aren't causing the issue. This allows you to narrow down the sources of problems causing your Windows 11 PC to crash, making it easier to troubleshoot. Here's what you need to do to boot in safe mode:",

      "WINDOWS 11 TIPS AND TRICKS YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU NEEDED",
      "Fix #2 - Remove any new software",
      "If your automatic rebooting problem began after installing a new app, uninstall that app and monitor your PC. If you still notice your PC restarting, there's a chance that the app has infected your system settings before you uninstalled it. To fix this, you'll need to restore the system. To do a system restore, you should first boot your PC in safe mode and then follow these steps:",

      "Fix #3 - Make sure your computer isn't overheating",
      "An overheating laptop or desktop will try to prevent damage to critical hardware components by shutting itself down. This is one of the leading causes of a Windows 11 PC getting stuck in a restart loop. If you've noticed your desktop giving off a lot more heat than usual or a laptop feeling hot to the touch, chances are you have an overheating issue.",
      "A computer's CPU and GPU generate the most heat, so I recommend monitoring those hardware pieces to see if they are overheating. You don't need any additional software to monitor the temperatures of your GPU, as some temperature readings are built into Windows 11. Here's how to check your hardware temperatures in Windows 11:",

      "Visual to show overheating on PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Unfortunately, the built-in temperature reading doesn't read your CPU temperature, and you'll need to manually go into the UEFI/BIOS to check the temperature without installing any additional software. However, there's a multitude of free-to-use apps that manufacturers have developed to measure your CPU temperature, including Core Temp, HWMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor.",
      "When you open one of these monitoring tools, you'll be able to view your PC's stats, including CPU and GPU temperatures and loads. If your CPU or GPU is running too hot, try cleaning the components to remove dust. For custom-built desktops, adding more exhaust fans to the case can improve airflow and cooling. Persistent overheating, especially in older laptops, may indicate that it's time to consider upgrading your machine.",
      "TAKE YOUR WINDOWS PC'S SECURITY TO THE NEXT LEVEL",
      "Fix #4 - Check for issues with your PC's power supply",
      "Image of a PC\u2019s power supply (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A computer will randomly restart when it has a failing power supply unit (PSU). If you have an issue with your power supply, you'll know if your computer won't restart or turn on. In addition to causing shut-offs and restart loops, a faulty power supply can also cause a blue screen of death error. In severe cases, you might even smell a burning scent or witness smoke coming from your PC's power supply exhaust vent. If you use a laptop with PSU issues, you cannot send your computer to a repair shop or the manufacturer for repair.",
      "Desktop PC owners have it a bit easier, assuming they have a pre-built PC that can be altered easily. If you do have a desktop, turn off and unplug your computer before going into the case to investigate if dust build-up is affecting your PSU. If your PSU fails, you must purchase and install a new one.",
      "Fix #5 - Scan your PC for viruses",

      "10 USEFUL WINDOWS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS YOU NEED TO KNOW",
      "Fix #6 - Disable automatic restart",
      "Step to disable automatic restart (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "If you have automatic restart enabled in Windows 11, your PC will restart every time it encounters a system failure. You can easily disable this future within the Windows 11 command prompt. Here's what you need to do:",

      "Fix #7 - Repair your system files",
      "Step to repair your system files (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "An issue with your Windows 11 system files may be causing your PC to constantly restart. If you think a corrupted system file is why your PC keeps restarting, there's a quick and easy fix you can do within the Windows Powershell. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool that will scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a system file has been modified, it will automatically replace the file with the correct version. Here's how to run the SFC command:",
      "Open the Windows Powershell\u00a0(or Command Prompt)Type in sfc /scannowPress EnterLeave the command prompt window open until the command completes, which could take some time",
      "Open the Windows Powershell\u00a0(or Command Prompt)",
      "Type in sfc /scannow",
      "Press Enter",
      "Leave the command prompt window open until the command completes, which could take some time",
      "If there's no problem with your Windows system files, after the scan, you'll see a message that says, \"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.\" If you instead see a message saying, \"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them,\" you should try running SFC again but in safe mode.",
      "Fix #8 - Check for RAM issues in the command prompt",
      "Your PC might be restarting itself because it doesn't have access to enough random access memory (RAM). Windows 11 may become unstable without enough RAM in your computer, causing the OS to randomly reboot. You can use the built-in Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 11 to check your computer for issues related to RAM. Here's what you need to do:",
      "Press the Windows Key\u00a0and RType mdsched.exe in the text boxClick OKSelect Restart Now and Check for Problems",
      "Press the Windows Key\u00a0and R",
      "Type mdsched.exe in the text box",
      "Click OK",
      "Select Restart Now and Check for Problems",
      "When your PC restarts, the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool will check for any RAM-related issues; if the test detects an error, take note of the error code. You can check the error code online to find the correct fix for that specific error.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These are the best fixes for a computer that is constantly restarting. While you can perform these fixes at home, it might be your best bet to send your computer to a repair shop or back to the manufacturer if you continue having an issue with your Windows 11 PC being stuck in a restart loop after these fixes. It also may be time to invest in a new laptop if you are experiencing a system slowdown and random restarting on your Windows 11 PC, but I would recommend trying to fix the problem first before buying a new machine.",

Scammers often target jobseekers randomly, hoping someone takes the bait. If you didn't apply, it's likely a scam. Always confirm directly with the company before proceeding.",
      "2. Verify recruiter credentials:\u00a0Always double-check the recruiter\u2019s details before responding to an email or clicking any links. Verify their email address, LinkedIn profile and company association. Legitimate companies will use official email domains, not free services like Gmail or Yahoo.",
      "3. Avoid downloading unsolicited files:\u00a0Be cautious of emails asking you to download any files or applications. Legitimate recruitment processes rarely require you to install software. If unsure, contact the company directly to confirm the request.",
      "4. Inspect links before clicking:\u00a0Hover over any links in the email to see their actual URL. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate sites but have subtle differences. If a link looks suspicious, avoid clicking on it.",
      "5. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Use strong antivirus or endpoint protection software to detect and block malicious downloads. Regularly update your security tools to ensure they can handle new threats effectively.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals always manage to come up with new ways to exploit people. While this particular scam is more focused on using your computer\u2019s resources than stealing data, it is still very dangerous. It shows that if a hacker can easily install software on your PC, they can also go ahead and steal your financial information and other personal data. Always verify the emails you receive, and try not to download anything you don\u2019t trust.",

      "Defense attorney Anne Taylor described conflicting statements from the eyewitness, whom Fox News Digital has chosen not to name, including alleged admissions that she had memory problems and wasn't sure if she was dreaming.",
      "Judge Steven Hippler did not hand down an order on two of the defense motions heard in the public section of a full-day hearing Thursday. Kohberger is back in court Friday morning.",

      "Bryan Kohberger, second from left, slouches as his attorney Anne Taylor argues that the DNA evidence used to aid in his arrest was illegally obtained. (Idaho Judicial Branch)",
      "Among the issues, Taylor argued that authorities should have gotten warrants before running DNA searches with Othram and the FBI, as well as before they took a trash can from outside the suspect's family home in Pennsylvania.",
      "\"I struggle with the idea that DNA left at a crime scene, that there's any expectation of privacy,\" Judge Steven Hippler told Taylor.",
      "However, he also grilled prosecutors as to why he should allow evidence that appeared to have been obtained in violation of an interim FBI policy.",
      "Prosecutors said it's because there's no expectation of privacy.",
      "And the interim policy itself \"clearly says this interim policy does not impose any legal limitations on otherwise lawful investigative or prosecutorial activities,\" Idaho Deputy Attorney General Jeff Nye told the court.",
      "As for the trash pull, he said it was lawfully obtained from Kohberger's family's trash bins, which were placed in the street, picked up by the local trash company and then delivered to authorities.",

      "Hippler told the sides he would take the matter under advisement and moved on to the next phase of the hearing, Taylor's arguments against the validity of a number of warrants in the case.",
      "She claimed that detectives misled the magistrate judge in a probable cause affidavit for warrants early on in the case and attacked the credibility of the surviving roommate who told police she saw a man with \"bushy eyebrows\" after hearing sounds of a struggle. She also claimed an FBI map of Kohberger's suspected movements was misleading and showed him traveling in the wrong direction.",
      "Hippler asked if DNA itself found at the scene isn't enough to support probable cause on its own.",
      "\"Isn't that probable cause every day and twice on Sunday?\" he asked.",
      "\"Not in this context,\" Taylor argued.",

      "Latah County Deputy Prosecutor Ashley Jennings countered that the defense could not back up its claim that investigators lied in their warrant affidavits.",

      "\"As the State points out, there is no dispute this is a high-profile case, particularly in Idaho,\" he wrote in his order. \"It was transferred to Ada County from Latah County on Defendant's motion to change venue. Defendant argued in that motion that the small size of the jury and the extensive, inflammatory media coverage prevented him from receiving a fair trial in Latah County. While Ada County has a larger jury pool to pull from than Latah County, the State is concerned that the risk of exposing that jury pool to evidence \u2014 particularly evidence that may not be deemed admissible at trial \u2014 remains significant.\"",
      "It was among 12 suppression motions filed by Kohberger's defense to be heard Thursday, marking the first time Kohberger has been back in court in over two months, when his defense team asked a Boise judge to \"sanction\" prosecutors over \"inadequate disclosures\" through the discovery process. He did not appear in person at a closed-door hearing earlier this week.",

      "His team is attempting to have nearly all the evidence collected by police against Kohberger thrown out by challenging the legality of search warrants.",
      "They are arguing the probable cause on which the search warrants were based was established primarily by the police use of investigative genetic genealogy (IGG), which they believe amounts to a violation of Kohberger\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.",
      "\"These are the sorts of decisions that really help determine someone\u2019s guilt at trial,\" said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago attorney who has been following the case. \"The attempt at keeping out much of this evidence likely won\u2019t be successful, but if this DNA evidence comes through to the jury, I think it\u2019s game set and match for him.\"",

      "SEATTLE \u2014 A federal district court judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship \u2014 the first skirmish in what promises to be a protracted legal battle over the new administration\u2019s agenda.",
      "Senior U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour heard 25 minutes of arguments\u00a0and then issued an order from the bench blocking the policy from taking effect for 14 days. There will be a further briefing on a preliminary injunction to permanently block the executive order while the case proceeds.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "\"I\u2019ve been on the bench for over four decades,\" Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee, said. \"I can\u2019t remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.\"",
      "The case comes as four states (Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon) sought to block the order before it is supposed to take effect in late February. It's one of five lawsuits filed by Democratic attorneys general and immigrant rights organizations challenging the order \u2014 which seeks to limit automatic birthright citizenship to children of U.S. citizens and green card holders \u2014 as unconstitutional.",
      "We\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at\u00a0tips@nbcuni.com\u00a0or\u00a0contact us\u00a0through one of these methods.",
      "The Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment has long been understood to grant automatic citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil except the children of foreign diplomats. An answer to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1857 Dred Scott decision, which held that people descended from slaves were not citizens, the amendment begins with the sentence: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and the federal government now seek to impose a modern version of Dred Scott,\u201d lawyers representing the four states wrote in a court filing. \u201cBut nothing in the Constitution grants the President, federal agencies, or anyone else authority to impose conditions on the grant of citizenship to individuals born in the United States.\u201d",
      "If implemented, Trump\u2019s order would cause the plaintiff states to lose federal funding that supports programs like Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the lawyers argue. In addition to the \u201csubstantial financial losses,\u201d the states would have to immediately bear the burden of modifying their administration of those programs to account for the change, the lawyers added.",
      "\u201cAbsent a temporary restraining order, children born in the Plaintiff States will soon be rendered undocumented, subject to removal or detention, and many stateless,\u201d the lawyers continued. \u201cThey will be denied their right to travel freely and re-enter the United States. They will lose their ability to obtain a Social Security number (SSN) and work lawfully as they grow up. They will be denied their right to vote, serve on juries, and run for certain offices. And they will be placed into positions of instability and insecurity as part of a new, Presidentially-created underclass in the United States.\u201d",
      "In their filings, Justice Department lawyers told Coughenour that the birthright citizenship order is an \u201cintegral part\u201d of Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress this nation\u2019s broken immigration system and the ongoing crisis at the southern border.\u201d",
      "Not only does Trump have the authority to issue the order, they argue, but the states lack standing to sue based on their alleged economic harms.",
      "\u201cA third party, including a state, has no legally cognizable interest in the recognition of citizenship by the federal government of a particular individual \u2014 let alone economic benefits or burdens that are wholly collateral to citizenship status,\u201d Justice Department litigator Brad Rosenberg wrote.",
      "While most of the Justice Department's filing focuses on technical arguments about why the states cannot sue, Rosenberg previews some of the arguments that could come into play as this and other cases move forward: how, in the Justice Department's view, courts have incorrectly interpreted the 14th Amendment for more than 100 years.",
      "\u201cAmple historical evidence shows that the children of non-resident aliens are subject to foreign powers \u2014 and, thus, are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and are not constitutionally entitled to birthright citizenship,\u201d Rosenberg wrote.",
      "Ultimately, the case is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. A Justice Department spokesperson said Thursday that it \"will vigorously defend President Trump\u2019s EO, which correctly interprets the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the Court and to the American people.\""

      "The price of bitcoin briefly surged on the news, but fell back to daily lows as traders took stock of the move.",
      "The idea of a strategic reserve of digital tokens like bitcoin has long been floated in cryptocurrency circles, but gained traction this summer, when both Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, discussed it at the annual Bitcoin conference.",
      "Trump reaffirmed his intention to create a reserve in a CNBC interview in December, stating it was incumbent upon the United States to be a leader in cryptocurrency technology, especially relative to China.",
      "Advocates have called for the creation of a reserve on the grounds that bitcoin is the new \"digital gold.\" Just as the United States holds gold reserves, crypto advocates say, it should own bitcoin, as well.",

      "Hours before Trump's order on Thursday, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., a longtime bitcoin advocate, released a statement upon her appointment as chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets calling for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve, which she said would \"strengthen the U.S. dollar\" and maintain the United States' status as a financial innovator.",
      "During his presidential campaign, Trump heavily courted the crypto community, which eventually became his largest donor group.",

      "Just before Trump took office, questions arose about the extent to which he intended to directly benefit from pro-crypto measures.  Last Friday, he launched his own digital token, $TRUMP. Although the token has no intrinsic value as a \"memecoin,\" its price was rapidly bid up as investors quickly viewed it as a means for tracking the success of the Trump administration. Yet less than 48 hours later, first lady Melania Trump issued her own coin, causing a substantial number of people in the cryptocurrency community, including previous Trump supporters, to criticize the launches as a means of personally benefiting from their positions.",
      "When it comes to conflicts of interest, Trump is in largely unchartered territory. It is not clear if he owns any bitcoin directly \u2014 though Vice President JD Vance owned $250,000 to $500,000 worth, according to disclosure forms. Trump voluntarily released an ethics document just before taking office that said he would limit his involvement in the Trump Organization while in office.",
      "Also in Thursday's order, Trump reversed a Biden administration directive to research a U.S. digital currency, often called a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Such currencies been adopted and researched by some governments around the world, but they have also been viewed with scrutiny and skepticism by some who cite privacy and surveillance concerns.",
      "Trump's order, which said CBDCs \"threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States,\" prohibits the establishing, issuing or circulating a CBDC in the United States."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she said. \u201cYou decide not to take your kids to Target so that they won\u2019t ask you for a bunch of stuff that you won\u2019t be able to afford, because you\u2019re trying to plan for whatever happens.\"",
      "Despite her preparations, the woman said she was still surprised and upset by how quickly Trump\u2019s order was implemented. When she received news of her leave, her superiors did not tell her why, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you decide to become a civil employee, your goal is to really help the American people. And anyone who\u2019s in this line of work knows that the goal is to always help all people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening that we\u2019ve become pawns in this grapple for control. But, again, this is what the American people voted for.\u201d",
      "A man who leads an LGBTQ Employee Resource Group in a Cabinet-level agency, and who asked that his name not be used due to fear of retaliation, said that his group helped the agency create internal policy for employees who transition genders. The policies included protocol for how to change a trans employee\u2019s internal records to accurately reflect their new gender identity and name. As of Wednesday evening, the once-public policy was no longer available on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "\u201cSo now an employee who\u2019s going through a transition will have to figure out the entire process themselves \u2014 they\u2019re creating the wheel over and over for each individual,\u201d he said. \"Without the policy, it essentially puts all of the burden on the employee to try to figure it out.\u201d",
      "The man added that since Trump\u2019s re-election in November, many LGBTQ workers at the federal agency told him they plan on going back into the closet at work. He said many have said, \"My plan is to be invisible for the next four years.\"",
      "The reverberations of the memo and executive order have extended throughout the federal government. The Wilson Center, a Washington think tank overseen by trustees appointed by the president, sent a letter to employees closing all diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility offices and related contracts. Citing the order, the letter said that the programs \u201cdivided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination.\u201d",
      "Trump issued a separate order directing the Federal Aviation Administration to end DEI efforts. An accompanying fact sheet about Trump's actions stated they had led to hiring of people with \u201csevere intellectual\u201d disabilities, psychiatric issues, and complete paralysis.\" It further ordered performance reviews of all FAA employees.",
      "Trump also rescinded a 1965 order signed by then President Lyndon Johnson prohibiting discrimination in hiring by federal contractors.",
      "Trump and his allies have labeled DEI programs as discriminatory.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on ending the scourge of DEI from our federal government and returning America to a merit based society where people are hired based on their skills, not for the color of their skin. This is another win for Americans of all races, religions and creeds,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "Many of the civil rights and diversity laws and programs were implemented because, for decades, few people of color, people with disabilities and veterans held the tax-supported jobs.",
      "In 2023, white people still were the majority of federal workers at 59.5% and men outnumbered women 55% to 45%, according to an analysis of federal data by the Partnership for Public Service, a group that focuses on drawing talented people to the federal workforce and improving how government works. Seventy-four percent of senior executive level positions are held by white workers, while 26% are held by people of color, the analysis found.",
      "In the U.S. today, 58.4% of the population is non-Hispanic white and 50.5% is female.",
      "Ramiro Cavazos is president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber, which has worked to increase the number of Hispanics and Latinos in political roles and the federal government.",
      "Cavazos dismissed the orders as political messaging. He questioned whether Trump's orders will have much staying power when they bump up against the realities of workforce demographics. Hispanics are the fastest-growing worker group, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\u201cWe are the only workforce that is out there,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, they know who the workforce is going to come from.\u201d",
      "'There is a lot of fear'",
      "The repercussions of Trump\u2019s executive orders were being felt even among workers not placed on paid leave.",
      "\u201cRight now there is a lot of fear,\u201d said one federal worker who did not want to be named to protect the worker's job. Some employees have stopped participating in messaging apps or email strings that connect workers of similar racial or ethnic backgrounds, the worker said.",
      "\u201cIt feels like we are in Cuba,\u201d said the worker, whose job was not eliminated but whose duties include providing access to resources to minority communities.",
      "The worker said colleagues were concerned about using social media or their phones, even personal ones, for fear they are being monitored or tapped.",
      "A man who works in a federal agency, and who asked that his name not be published due to fears of retaliation, said a leadership training his team was assembling was scrapped in response to the new orders. The training was designed to teach managers how to handle working with multigenerational staff.",
      "\u201cEveryone has to completely fall in line. There\u2019s no real room for dissent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long couple of years.\u201d",
      "The OPM memo also instructed agency and department heads to provide lists of DEI offices in their divisions and its employees. An email was sent to all federal workers threatening \"adverse consequences\" if they fail to report colleagues whose DEI duties may have been obscured or disguised.",
      "The more than two-decade federal employee who became a DEI adviser was moved to a civil rights office in December. At 5 p.m. on Wednesday, he was notified in an email that he\u2019d be placed on leave with benefits immediately, that his email would be suspended and he\u2019d get updates when they were available.",
      "He said DEI is being used \u201cas a convenient scapegoat for more grievance politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe way in which DEIA is talked about and presented and used as some kind of boogeyman in conservative politics is absolutely incorrect on its face as to what DEIA means, what we do, how beneficial those programs are to, not just minority communities within the workforce, but to everyone,\u201d the worker said.",
      "\u201cDEI policies benefit everyone. A rising tide raises all boats,\u201d he said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden had promoted diversity, equity and inclusion during his administration and addressed it in executive orders.",
      "In a 2023 order, he required every government agency to create a DEI team and ordered an oversight committee to steer the DEI work. Trump has rescinded that and other orders.",
      "Jes\u00fas Soriano, president of the American Federal Government Employees Local 3403 and a federal worker, noted that the federal workforce has a lower pay gap across genders, races and other groups compared to the private sector. \u201cWe are able to provide professional service to the government under an oath of office, regardless of what we look like,\u201d he said.",
      "The government still has a lot of work to do to ensure the workforce represents the people it serves, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is another way for President Trump to undermine the merit-based civil service and then turn hiring and firing decisions into loyalty tests,\u201d Soriano said.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 21:27:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Panama\u2019s control of the canal that bears its name should not be returned to the United States despite President Donald Trump\u2019s calls of \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Panamanians say.",
    "story": [
      "Panama\u2019s control of the canal that bears its name should not be returned to the United States despite President Donald Trump\u2019s calls of \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Panamanians say.",
      "Although most people thought the matter was closed when Panama officially took control of canal operations from the United States in 1999, the issue reared its head during his campaign when he suggested the engineering marvel that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans was being run by China and should return to U.S. control.",
      "Trump repeated that claim in his inaugural speech this week, saying, \u201cChina is operating the Panama Canal,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Panama during a Latin-American and Caribbean tour that starts late next week.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Panama\u2019s President Jose Raul Mulino dismissed the notion as he and other Panamanian leaders tried to gain international support this week for keeping the canal under their nation\u2019s authority.",
      "Among those leaders is Jorge Luis Quijano, a former canal administrator, who insists Panamanians are running the waterway, not the Chinese. He also disputed Trump\u2019s complaint that U.S. ships pay more to pass through the canal than other countries.",
      "\u201cA ship with a Panamanian flag pays as much as an American-flagged ship,\u201d Quijano said, adding that rates are based on a vessel\u2019s size, and large container ships may pay as much as $1.2 million to pass through the 51-mile waterway that cuts through the Isthmus of Panama.",
      "Quijano said he started working at the canal in 1975 after graduating as an engineer from Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, when the United States still controlled it. He said Americans were the supervisors when he started, but Panamanians eventually became the managers and \u201cthe Americans retired.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw the whole movie,\u201d Quijano said jokingly about witnessing the transition over the 44 years he worked at the canal, eventually becoming vice president of operations and leading a reconstruction effort that expanded the channel\u2019s capacity in 2016.",
      "Humberto Arcia, 72, who lived two miles from the canal in the Chorrillo neighborhood as a child, said he will never forget the price Panamians paid for the right to run the canal in their own country.",
      "The Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty signed in 1903 gave the United States the right to build and manage the Panama Canal. Construction began in 1904 after a failed attempt by a French construction team to build the ambitious passage.",
      "The massive project took the lives of more than 5,000 construction workers, 350 of them U.S. citizens, until its completion in 1914. Most of the workers were from Caribbean nations.",
      "Panama\u2019s relationship with the United States was marked by riots and demonstrations opposing\u00a0American involvement in the Central American nation\u2019s affairs and control over the canal.",
      "In 1964, anti-American riots broke out in Panama because the Panamanian flag was not allowed to fly next to the U.S. flag at Balboa High School in the U.S.-controlled Canal Zone that was attended by American students, according to the U.S. National Archives. The Canal Zone was a 10-mile concession of the United States where canal employees and their families lived.",
      "The protests escalated and students from multiple high schools outside the Canal Zone marched to its entrance, where at least 20 people were killed in clashes with the U.S. military, National Guard and Canal Zone Police during three days of riots. The protests are commemorated each year on Jan. 9, a national holiday, known as the Day of Martyrs.",
      "Arcia, a retired banker and attorney, remembers hearing relatives of the students talk about their loss when he lived near the Canal. \u201cTheir suffering changed the lives of their families forever,\u201d he said.",
      "The riots were a turning point in Panama\u2019s history, but it wasn\u2019t until 1977 that President Jimmy Carter and the Panamanian military leader Omar Torrijos signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaty that would eventually lead to Panamanian oversight.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority assumed full control on Dec. 31, 1999.",
      "U.S. historian David McCullough wrote in his book \u201cThe Path Between the Seas\u201d: \u201cThe fifty miles between the oceans were among the hardest ever won by human effort and ingenuity, and no statistics on tonnage or tolls can begin to convey the grandeur of what was accomplished. Primarily the canal is an expression of that old and noble desire to bridge the divide, to bring people together. It is a work of civilization.\u201d",
      "The Panama Canal was designated one of the seven wonders of the modern world in 1994.",
      "Today, the canal is one of the United States\u2019 most important trade routes and the top revenue source for Panama. The canal generates yearly revenues above $5 billion to the country\u2019s coffers, according to the U.S. State Department.",
      "The ships that pass through generate income, but the canal also attracts businesses that create jobs in industries such as logistics, insurance and banking, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).",
      "Panamanians said the canal is part of their national identity.",
      "Panamanian business consultant Marjorie Miller said her great-grandfather, John Miller, moved to Panama from Jamaica to work at the canal. U.S. Census Bureau records show he lived in the American labor camp known as the Red Tank with other canal workers.",
      "\u201cI always knew how important the canal was to our country because of my ancestors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Panama Canal is Panama. It is our greatest asset.\u201d",
      "Miller said she is frustrated by comments posted by Panamanians on social media about how the United States could probably do a better job running the canal than Panama.",
      "\u201cThe comments come from ignorance,\u201d she said, adding that many younger people in her country lack the historical knowledge to understand the importance of the canal for the country.",
      "Miller also said that Trump\u2019s comments about China\u2019s involvement in the canal\u2019s operations may have arisen because Panama broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2017 and established ties with China instead.",
      "\u201cWe were friends one day, and now we are hearing, \u2018We want your canal,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big change when the U.S. is our greatest trading partner.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Mao Ning, said at a Wednesday news briefing that Trump\u2019s comments about China and the canal are baseless.",
      "\u201cPanama\u2019s sovereignty and independence are not negotiable, and the Panama Canal is not under direct or indirect control by any power,\u201d Ning said. \u201cChina does not take part in managing or operating the canal. Never ever has China interfered. We respect Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the Canal and recognize it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "Quijano, the former vice president of operations, said he doubts the United States could easily run the canal because it takes 12 years of training for an engineer to learn the complicated system of locks and water elevators that route giant ships through the canal.",
      "\u201cIf he thinks he is going to take it back and then we are going to run it for him, the answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us just need to respect the treaties and the sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "Arcia, who grew up near the canal, said Trump needs to change his tone toward Panama: \u201cWhat we always want is a beautiful relationship of equality, not submission.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON\u2014 President Donald Trump signed an executive order pardoning 23 anti-abortion-rights activists Thursday, one day before he is expected to address thousands of anti-abortion-rights demonstrators at their annual march in Washington.",
      "\u201cTwenty-three people were prosecuted, they should not have been prosecuted,\u201d Trump said at the Oval Office signing ceremony Thursday, noting that \u201cmany of them\u201d are elderly. \u201cThis is a great honor to sign. They will be very happy.\u201d",
      "Some are in jail, White House staff secretary Will Scharf told Trump as he stood next to him. None of their names were immediately released. Conservatives have charged the Biden administration with using a 1994 law protecting abortion clinics, providers and patients to target peaceful protesters.",
      "Congress enacted the\u00a0Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in response to an increase in violence against abortion providers and their patients, with the aim of allowing people to safely access such services. It also protects First Amendment religious rights. Property damage can be prosecuted under the statute.",

    "summary": "The Senate voted to advance Pete Hegseth's nomination to be Trump's defense secretary, putting him on a path to final confirmation at the end of the week.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to advance Pete Hegseth's nomination to be President Donald Trump's defense secretary, putting him on a path to final confirmation at the end of the week.",
      "The vote was 51-49, with just two Republicans \u2014 moderate Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 voting with all 47 Democrats to try to block Hegseth. He needed a simple majority to advance to a final vote.",
      "Shortly before the vote, Murkowski became the first Republican to publicly oppose Hegseth's nomination, saying some of the behavior he has admitted to demonstrates a \"lack of judgment\" and is \"unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces.\"",
      "After the vote, Collins said she had raised concerns directly to Hegseth about his comments that women should not serve in combat roles.",
      "In his confirmation hearing, Hegseth walked those comments back, telling senators he supports women's serving in combat as long as standards remain high. But Collins said in her statement she is \"not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\"",
      "Still, Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who has guided Hegseth through the process, declared after the vote that Hegseth will be confirmed Friday. Asked about Murkowski and Collins\u2019 opposing him, Wicker said,\u00a0\u201cI was not surprised, and I do understand.\u201d",
      "Thursday's vote was a significant step forward for Hegseth, whose nomination just last month appeared to be on the verge of collapse after multiple news reports detailed allegations of alcohol abuse, a sexual assault and the financial mismanagement of organizations that he led.",
      "Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor and Army combat veteran, has denied all of those allegations.",
      "The GOP-led Senate voted to end debate on his nomination after eleventh-hour revelations that a former sister-in-law of Hegseth\u2019s had said in a sworn affidavit that was shared with senators that  he had demonstrated \u201cerratic and aggressive behavior over many years\u201d and had made his ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth, \u201cfear for her safety\u201d while they were married. The former sister-in-law, Daniella Hegseth, also wrote in the affidavit that \u201cSamantha once told me that Hegseth grabbed her groin without consent at their home.\u201d",
      "The affidavit was submitted in response to a request for information from Sen. Jack Reed, of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.\u00a0The existence of the affidavit was first reported by NBC News.",
      "Daniella Hegseth said she \u201cdid not personally witness physical or sexual abuse by Hegseth.\u201d Samantha Hegseth said in a statement that there was no physical abuse during the marriage. A lawyer for his ex-wife did not respond to the previously unreported allegation.",
      "Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Pete Hegseth, wrote in an email: \u201cAs NBC is well aware, the actual participant, Samantha has denied these false allegations, yet NBC continues to irresponsibly report false allegations by an uninvolved third party as if they were fact.\u201d",
      "Despite Thursday's vote, Hegseth is still not in the clear. Four GOP senators\u2019 joining all 47 Democrats on the final vote would result in Hegseth\u2019s falling short of the majority he needs to be confirmed.",
      "While Sens. Shelly Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Mike Rounds, R-S.D., confirmed they would vote in favor of Hegseth and Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, reiterated her support for him Thursday, several others remained on the fence.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he would vote to advance Hegseth's nomination and appeared to be leaning in favor of final passage as he investigated the myriad allegations against Hegseth.",
      "\"I'm still examining the record. ... I go through extensive due diligence,\" Tillis said Thursday. \"I have talked to numerous people. I have spent hours on the phone. I have yet to find one instance of a firsthand account with corroboration to support the allegations. If I find that, then it would influence my vote.",
      "\"But I've completed due diligence, and I've looked for it, and I haven't found it,\" he said.",
      "Wicker, the Armed Services chairman, foreshadowed just how close a final vote on Hegseth might be, suggesting that Vice President JD Vance may be needed to break a 50-50 tie.",
      "\u201cIf I were JD Vance, I\u2019d stick around,\u201d\u00a0Wicker said.",
      "Speaking in opposition to Hegseth's nomination, Reed said on the Senate floor that he believed the FBI's initial background check into Hegseth was rushed and incomplete. He added that the FBI has had to give him two additional briefings on Hegseth since then, including Wednesday night.",
      "\"Before Mr. Hegseth's hearing, I was alarmed that investigators had neglected to contact critical witnesses and whistleblowers, and I urged them to reopen the investigation,\" Reed said in his floor speech. \"During my experience on the Armed Services Committee, it is unprecedented that the FBI has returned to my office two more times, as recently as last night, to provide additional information on the nominee.",
      "\"Frankly, I still do not believe the background investigation is complete,\" he said."

      "One day after he spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, President Donald Trump pushed the kingdom Thursday to increase its U.S. investment, saying he would ask the Saudis to \u201cround out\u201d their promised $600 billion \u201cto around $1 trillion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019ll do that because we\u2019ve been very good to them,\u201d Trump said in virtual remarks to business and foreign leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. During Wednesday's call, Trump's first with a foreign leader since his inauguration Monday, the crown prince, the kingdom's de facto head, told Trump he would invest at least $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, according to a readout provided by the Saudi government.",
      "Trump, addressing the crowd at Davos on Thursday, also said he would push Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the price of oil.",
      "\u201cYou got to bring it down, which, frankly, I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t do before the election,\u201d he said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t show a lot of love by them not doing it. I was a little surprised by that.\u201d",
      "Crude oil prices fell after Trump's remarks, while U.S. stocks jumped.",
      "In a rollicking address, Trump ticked through the sweep of actions he has taken to yank back much of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency and launch his own agenda, covering everything from Middle East peace to a new official policy charging that \u201cthere are only two genders, male and female.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished more in four days \u2014 we have really been working four days \u2014 than other administrations have accomplished in four years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "We\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at\u00a0tips@nbcuni.com\u00a0or\u00a0contact us\u00a0through one of these methods.",
      "And he didn\u2019t shy away from pressing his interlocutors directly.",
      "After a question from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Trump charged that financial institutions, including Bank of America, had refused banking services to conservatives.\u00a0He also warned the business and foreign leaders before him that \u201cif you don\u2019t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.\u201d",
      "Bank of America pushed back against Trump's claims in a statement, saying, \u201cWe welcome conservatives and have no political litmus test.\u201d",
      "JPMorgan Chase said, \u201cWe have never and would never close an account for political reasons, full stop.\u201d",
      "Trump has littered his return to Washington with promises to drive a multibillion-dollar surge of investments in the U.S. economy, shore up American industry and level new tariffs in trade negotiations.",
      "He has threatened steep tariffs on other countries, including Canada and Mexico, which he said could start as early as Feb. 1, and also threatened the European Union. And he has moved to quickly expand domestic energy production, kick off an immigration crackdown and pull the United States from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization.",
      "The virtual address and subsequent question session marked Trump\u2019s first major speech to foreign and business leaders since he assumed office. Trump\u2019s allies have long derided the global elites at Davos as working to undermine Trump\u2019s agenda, but he was given a warm welcome from the organizers and executives onstage, despite a rollout of policies in his first days in office that captured his nationalist tendencies.",
      "Later, Trump explained how he sees the U.S.-China relationship and said he wants Chinese President Xi Jinping to help him end the war in Ukraine, where, he said, too many millions of soldiers have died on a \u201ckilling field.\u201d He said Kyiv \u201cis ready to make a deal\u201d and suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin remains a holdout. \u201cYou are going to have to ask Russia,\u201d Trump said when he was asked whether a peace agreement could come together by this time next year.",
      "Trump said in September that if he were re-elected, he would end the nearly three-year-long war in Ukraine on Day One of his presidency or possibly before. But a peace deal seemed far off this week, and Trump threatened Wednesday to impose sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its allies if the war doesn't end soon.",
      "\"We can do it the easy way, or the hard way \u2014 and the easy way is always better,\" he said on Truth Social. \"It\u2019s time to 'MAKE A DEAL.'\"",
      "Asked at Davos about a call he held with Xi last week, Trump clarified that it wasn\u2019t him reaching out. Xi \u201ccalled me,\u201d Trump said, nodding to how he views a key relationship that has been complicated by trade talks and the Covid pandemic, which originated in China."

    "title": "Trump says China controls the Panama Canal \u2014 but here's how it really works",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:35:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts dispute President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the Panama Canal is controlled by China and overcharging U.S. ships.",
    "story": [
      "A quarter-century after the U.S. handed control of the Panama Canal to Panama, President Donald Trump wants to take it back.",
      "Early this month, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to regain control of the canal from Panama, one of the U.S.'s closest allies in Latin America, describing it as \u201cvital\u201d for national security.",
      "But his gripe is more with U.S. rival China, which he says is \u201coperating\u201d a critical waterway that serves as a transit point for almost 5% of the world's maritime trade.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump said Monday during his inaugural address. \u201cWe gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Panama strongly rebuked Trump\u2019s comments, with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino saying the canal \u201cis and will continue to be Panama\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Mulino also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that China controls the canal.",
      "\u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\u201d he said Monday in a statement in Spanish.",
      "China said it agreed with the Panamanian president, saying the canal \u201cis not under the direct or indirect control of any power.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina does not participate in the management or operation of the canal and has never interfered in matters related to it,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have always respected Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognized it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "The neutrality of the nearly 50-mile canal, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year, is enshrined in Panama\u2019s Constitution and is enforced by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what has made the Panama Canal so successful, and why it\u2019s still one of the main commercial arteries of the world \u2014 because of this neutrality,\u201d said Beatriz Garc\u00eda Nice, a Latin America program associate at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.",
      "The United States began building the canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The project was completed in 1914 as part of efforts to cut the transit time for U.S. commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.",
      "By the mid-20th century, control of the canal had become a source of tension between the U.S. and Panama, erupting into anti-American riots in 1964 that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. soldiers and more than 20 Panamanians.",
      "On Dec. 31, 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978 in what Trump has called \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d The U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Several international companies that now manage ports along the canal, including the Seattle-based SSA Marine, which operates a cargo terminal on the Atlantic side, won their rights in bidding processes that were described as fair and nondiscriminatory by U.S. officials at the time.",
      "In 1997, Hutchison Ports, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong that manages 53 ports around the world, won the rights to manage two ports \u2014 Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "The Trump administration argues that China could use those ports to turn the Panama Canal into a \u201cchoke point\u201d against the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf these companies control both ends of that canal in a time of conflict, and the Chinese tell them, \u2018Shut it down and don\u2019t let the U.S. go through there,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a big, big problem,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week during his Senate confirmation hearing, \u201ca big economic problem and a big national security and defense problem.\u201d",
      "Though at opposite ends of the canal, the ports are not gateways to the waterway \u2014 ships do not have to pass through them to enter the canal. Instead, the ports mostly serve as places to handle cargo.",
      "\u201cIt would take an act of war, effectively, for the Chinese to shut it down,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a port company to shut down a canal.\u201d",
      "Trump also claimed that the U.S. has been \u201covercharged\u201d for its ships to sail through the canal, saying that Panama was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the treaty.",
      "\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy,\u201d he said in the inaugural address.",
      "Because the waterway, which is fed by a freshwater lake, is seeing its water levels decrease because of a warming climate, the Panama Canal Authority has limited the number of ships that can pass through daily and raised fees for all ships regardless of the country they belong to.",
      "\u201cThe fees have been raised across the board in a professional, transparent manner, nothing less, nothing more,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cIt is simply like any different toll that is managed professionally and independently.\u201d",
      "Sabatini and Nice say the growing accusations could hurt U.S. relations with Panama, where China has been making inroads.",
      "\u201cWhat this is doing is questioning even further if the United States is a reliable partner, especially in face of the Chinese influence that is already in the region,\u201d Nice said.",
      "As for Trump\u2019s threat to use military force to retake the canal, Sabatini said such a drastic action would require Senate approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an international treaty, it was approved by the U.S. Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that the executive can unilaterally decide to revoke.\u201d",
      "Still, the Panama Canal Authority has launched an audit of Hutchison Ports, which Nice said was an attempt to placate Washington.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to not confront one of your biggest allies and are saying, \u2018If this is going to help and sort of bring down the temperature, then we will do it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchison Ports said it was fully cooperating with the audit and remained committed \u201cto excellence and ethics in each of our operations,\u201d Bloomberg News reported, citing a statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Trump also vastly overstated the number of Americans killed during construction of the canal, saying 38,000 lives were lost. About 5,600 out of 56,000 workers are believed to have died from injury or disease during the U.S. phase of construction, according to the Panama Canal Authority, most of whom were from the Caribbean.",
      "For many Panamanians, the canal\u2019s independence is a matter of pride.",
      "\u201cThe Canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999,\u201d President Mulino said. \u201cSince then until now, for 25 years, without interruption, we have managed and expanded it responsibly to serve the world and its commerce, including the United States.\u201d"

    "summary": "LONDON \u2014 A teenager who stabbed three young girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England was sentenced Thursday to more than 50 years in prison for what a judge called \u201cthe most extreme, shocking and exceptionally serious crime.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 A teenager who\u00a0stabbed three young girls to death\u00a0at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England was sentenced Thursday to more than 50 years in prison for what a judge called \u201cthe most extreme, shocking and exceptionally serious crime.\u201d",
      "Judge Julian Goose said 18-year-old\u00a0Axel Rudakubana\u00a0\u201cwanted to try and carry out mass murder of innocent, happy young girls.\u201d",
      "Goose said that he couldn\u2019t impose a sentence of life without parole, because Rudakubana was under 18 at the time of the crime.",
      "But the judge said he must serve 52 years, minus the six months he\u2019s been in custody, before being considered for parole, and \u201cit is likely he will never be released.\u201d",
      "Rudakubana was 17 when he attacked the children in the seaside town of Southport in July, killing Alice Da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. He wounded eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, along with teacher Leanne Lucas and John Hayes, a local businessman who intervened.",
      "The attack shocked the country and set off\u00a0both street violence and soul-searching. The government has announced a public inquiry into how the system failed to stop the killer, who had been referred to the authorities multiple times over his obsession with violence.",
      "Defendant disrupts the hearing",
      "Rudakubana faced three counts of murder, 10 of attempted murder and additional charges of possessing a knife, the poison ricin and an al-Qaida manual. He\u00a0unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty\u00a0on all charges on Monday.",
      "But he wasn\u2019t in court to hear sentence passed on Thursday.",
      "Hours earlier he had been led into the dock at Liverpool Crown Court in northwest England, dressed in a gray prison tracksuit. But as prosecutors began outlining the evidence, Rudakubana interrupted by shouting that he felt ill and wanted to see a paramedic.",
      "Goose ordered the accused to be removed when he continued shouting. A person in the courtroom shouted \u201cCoward!\u201d as Rudakubana was taken out.",
      "The hearing continued without him.",
      "Horror on a summer day",
      "Prosecutor Deanna Heer described how the attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when 26 little girls were \u201cgathered around the tables making bracelets and singing along to Taylor Swift songs.\u201d",
      "Rudakubana, armed with a large knife, intruded and\u00a0began stabbing the girls\u00a0and their teacher.",
      "The court was shown video of the suspect arriving at the Hart Space venue in a taxi and entering the building. Within seconds, screams erupted and children ran outside in panic, some of them wounded. One girl made it to the doorway, but was pulled back inside by the attacker. She was stabbed 32 times but survived.",
      "Gasps and sobs could be heard in court as the videos played.",
      "Heer said two of the dead children \u201csuffered particularly horrific injuries which are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.\u201d One of the dead girls had 122 injuries, while another suffered 85 wounds.",
      "A teenager obsessed with violence",
      "The prosecutor said Rudakubana had \u201ca longstanding obsession with violence, killing, genocide.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis only purpose was to kill. And he targeted the youngest and most vulnerable in society,\u201d she said, as relatives of the victims watched on in the courtroom.",
      "Heer said that when he was taken to a police station, Rudakubana was heard to say: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing those children are dead, I\u2019m so glad, I\u2019m so happy.\u201d",
      "The killings triggered days of\u00a0anti-immigrant violence\u00a0across the country after far-right activists seized on\u00a0incorrect reports\u00a0that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the U.K. Some suggested the crime was a jihadi attack, and alleged that police and the government were withholding information.",
      "Rudakubana was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Christian parents from Rwanda, and investigators haven\u2019t been able to pin down his motivation. Police found documents about subjects including Nazi Germany, the Rwandan genocide and car bombs on his devices.",
      "In the years before the attack, he had been reported to multiple authorities over his violent interests and actions. All of the agencies failed to spot the danger he posed.",
      "In 2019, he phoned a children\u2019s advice line to ask \u201cWhat should I do if I want to kill somebody?\u201d He said he had taken a knife to school because he wanted to kill someone who was bullying him. Two months later, he attacked a fellow student with a hockey stick and was convicted of assault.",
      "The definition of terrorism",
      "Prosecutors said Rudakubana was referred three times to the government\u2019s anti-extremism program, Prevent, when he was 13 and 14 \u2014 once after researching school shootings in class, then for uploading pictures of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to Instagram and for researching a London terror attack.",
      "But they concluded his crimes should not be classed as terrorism because Rudakubana had no discernable political or religious cause. Heer said \u201chis purpose was the commission of mass murder, not for a particular end, but as an end in itself.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said this week that laws might need updating to combat a \u201cnew threat\u201d from violent individuals whose mix of motivations test the traditional definition of terrorism, \u201cacts of extreme violence carried out by loners, misfits, young men in their bedrooms.\u201d",
      "Wrenching testimony from victims",
      "Several relatives and survivors read emotional statements in court, describing how the attack had shattered their lives.",
      "Lucas, 36, who ran the dance class, said that \u201cthe trauma of being both a victim and a witness has been horrendous.\u201d",
      "\u201cI cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died?\u201d she said.",
      "A 14-year-old survivor, who can\u2019t be named because of a court order, said that while she was physically recovering. \u201cwe will all have to live with the mental pain from that day forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope you spend the rest of your life knowing that we think you\u2019re a coward,\u201d she said.",
      "The prosecutor read out a statement from the parents of Alice Da Silva Aguiar, who said their daughter\u2019s killing had \u201cshattered our souls.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe used to cook for three. Now we only cook for two. It doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d they said. \u201cAlice was our purpose for living, so what do we do now?\u201d"

    "summary": "An artificial intelligence-powered weapon detection system failed to pick up the handgun a 17-year-old Nashville, Tennessee, student used in a school shooting Wednesday that killed a 16-year-old girl, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "An artificial intelligence-powered weapon detection system failed to pick up the handgun a 17-year-old Nashville, Tennessee, student used in a school shooting Wednesday that killed a 16-year-old girl, officials said.",
      "The software, called Omnilert, failed to detect the gun because of where cameras were in Antioch High School, Metro Nashville Public Schools spokesperson Sean Braisted said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.",
      "But the system was activated by police brandishing their weapons during the response to the shooting, Braisted said.",
      "Omnilert connects to the school's existing network of cameras and uses AI technology to detect weapons, he said, but \"in this instance, based on the shooter's location in proximity to the cameras, it wasn't close enough to get an accurate read and to activate that alarm.\"",
      "Metro Nashville Public Schools Director Adrienne Battle said, \"There is not one system that is 100% going to capture everything that a person may have on them.\"",
      "Omnilert works by turning security cameras \"into life-saving tools, protecting lives while reducing the operational, legal, and social costs of gun violence,\" its website says. It helps detect firearms and then triggers immediate alerts.",
      "\"These are designed to capture things that are on camera, and so we wanted to have a system that worked on multiple cameras throughout the network. It does work, but it's not going to work in every instance, in every spot, based on where that weapon might be visible,\" Braisted said. \"So that's why we have additional safety and security protocols.\"",
      "In addition to Omnilert, the school uses AI systems at the front door, it has security vestibules, and it uses school resource officers.",
      "\"It all works together as a system, but one system alone is not going to keep people safe,\" Braisted said. \"And there's also just the general public concerns around how a 17-year-old has a weapon.",
      "\"I mean, these are questions that are beyond the scope of Metro Schools but need to be addressed by the broader community,\" he said. \"But we are doing what we can as a district to install and equip our schools with the safety protocols and resources that we can use to be safe.\"",
      "The missed detection offers a lesson in the shortcomings of high-tech security solutions \u2014 and the risk of relying on them, experts said.",
      "\u201cThis highlights the challenges school districts face,\u201d said Donald Maye, head of operations at IPVM, a surveillance technology research company that investigates weapon-detection systems.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll make these announcements that they\u2019ve invested millions on a solution and then there are still many cases that can occur where the system is not going to be a factor in preventing violence,\u201d Maye said.",
      "Amy Klinger, director of programs for the nonprofit Educator\u2019s School Safety Network, said the most effective safeguards against violence are based on building trust among students, teachers and administrators to share early signs of potential threats \u2014 like erratic behavior or troubling social media posts.",
      "\u201cIn the vast majority of cases there is something of concern \u2014 behaviors, disclosures, conversations, warning signs \u2014 that if someone is paying attention you could pick up on,\u201d Klinger said. \u201cIf you combine that with technology, great. But you can\u2019t replace it with technology.\u201d",
      "Some have questioned why the school did not use metal detectors. Battle told reporters Thursday that research has shown there are pros and cons to using the detectors.",
      "\"There are lots of unintended consequences, mainly when you think about the types of learning environments we want for our students. I mean, the first person we want our students to interact with are their principals and their teachers and their fellow students,\" she said.",
      "A motive in the shooting is unclear. Nashville Police Chief John Drake said authorities are looking into \"some materials on the internet\" believed to be from the shooter, who was identified as Solomon Henderson. He shot and killed himself after the attack.",
      "Authorities said Henderson was an active student. They said he took the school bus before he later opened fire in the cafeteria, killing Josselin Corea Escalante. Another student was wounded when he was grazed in the arm."

      "President Donald Trump issued full and unconditional pardons Wednesday to two Washington, D.C., police officers who were convicted for their roles in a deadly chase of a young man on a moped in 2020 and subsequent cover-up, a case that led to protests in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Trump granted clemency to Metropolitan Police Department Officer Terence Sutton, who was sentenced in September to more than five years in prison. He faced a District of Columbia charge of second-degree murder, and federal charges of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice in the\u00a0October 2020 unauthorized pursuit that killed Karon Hylton-Brown, 20. Sutton was the first D.C. police officer to be convicted of murder for conduct while on duty.",
      "The same jury that found Sutton guilty also convicted Andrew Zabavsky, a lieutenant who supervised Sutton, of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice.\u00a0Zabavsky was sentenced to four years in prison. He was not accused of the more serious charge of second-degree murder. Trump granted Zabavsky clemency.",
      "Both men had been free pending the outcome of their appeals.",

      "\u201cThey were arrested, put in jail for five years because they went after an illegal,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cAnd I guess something happened where something went wrong, and they arrested the two officers and put them in jail for going after a criminal.\u201d",
      "Hylton-Brown was an American citizen, said David Shurtz, an attorney representing his estate.",

      "The Metropolitan Police Department thanked Trump \"for supporting its officers\u201d after the Sutton-Zabavsky pardons, adding in a statement that the prosecutions \u201cwere literally unprecedented.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever before, in any other jurisdiction in the country, has a police officer been charged with second-degree murder for pursuing a suspect,\u201d the department said.",
      "On the night of Oct. 23, 2020,\u00a0months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis had ignited widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice, Sutton used a police car to chase Hylton-Brown, who was driving a moped without a helmet on a sidewalk in northwest Washington, prosecutors said.",
      "Hylton-Brown ignored Sutton\u2019s attempt to stop him and drove off. Sutton chased Hylton-Brown for more than 10 blocks \u201cat unreasonable speeds,\u201d prosecutors said, and, at one point, drove the wrong way on a one-way street. Sutton followed Hylton-Brown into a narrow alley, turned off his car\u2019s emergency lights and siren and accelerated. When Hylton-Brown exited the alley, he was struck by another vehicle, according to prosecutors.",
      "\u201cAs Mr. Hylton-Brown lay unconscious in the street in a pool of his own blood, Sutton and Zabavsky, agreed to cover up what Sutton had done to prevent any further investigation of the incident,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement in September.",
      "The officers allowed the driver whose car struck Hylton-Brown to leave the scene within 20 minutes of the crash, then turned off their body-worn cameras, conferred privately and left, prosecutors said.",
      "Sutton drove his police car directly over the crash site, audibly crushing pieces of debris from the collision as he left, prosecutors said, and neither officer contacted the department\u2019s Major Crash Unit or its Internal Affairs Division to each initiate investigations.",
      "They also misled their commanding officer about the severity of the crash, denying that a police chase had even occurred and omitting any mention of Hylton-Brown\u2019s critical injuries, prosecutors said. According to prosecutors, Zabavsky also falsely implied that Hylton-Brown had been drunk and Sutton drafted a false police report.",
      "Hylton-Brown suffered severe head trauma and died two days later.",
      "\u201cThe jury in this case found the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for their roles in the murder of Karon Hylton Brown and a related cover up, affirming that what happened here was a serious crime,\u201d then-U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves said in September after the officers were sentenced. \u201cPublic safety requires public trust. Crimes like this erode that trust and are a disservice to the community and the thousands of officers who work incredibly hard, within the bounds of the Constitution, to keep us safe.\u201d",
      "The case spurred days of protests outside a police station in Washington.",
      "Shurtz, the attorney representing Hylton-Brown\u2019s relatives, said Trump\u2019s decision was \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cmisguided.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u00a0think it\u2019s one of the worst decisions Trump has ever made,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe he is being ill-advised.\u201d",
      "Shurtz believes police unions influenced the decision for the officers to receive pardons.",
      "Zabavsky\u2019s attorney, Christopher Zampogna, said in a statement that his client \u201cthanks President Trump for issuing his pardon unconditionally.\u201d J. Michael Hannon, Sutton\u2019s attorney, did not immediately return a request for comment."

      "Daniels rushed for 891 yards in the regular season, first all time among rookie quarterbacks.",

      "His 46 postseason completions are first all time among rookie quarterbacks. With six more passing yards, Daniels will pass Russell Wilson to rank first among postseason passing yards by a rookie.",
      "These feats have left little doubt that Daniels will be named the league\u2019s offensive rookie of the year, but there is still more history he could achieve \u2014 because on Sunday, Daniels has the chance to go where no rookie quarterback has ever gone. A win in Sunday\u2019s NFC title game in Philadelphia would send Daniels to the Super Bowl as the first rookie starting quarterback.",

      "Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley, a free-agent addition, spearheaded the league\u2019s second-best rushing attack, carrying the team to the NFC East title. And the defense, in its first season under veteran coordinator Vic Fangio, led the NFL in yards allowed per game.",
      "Now, Sirianni\u2019s team is on the precipice of a second Super Bowl appearance in three seasons. Philadelphia will be favored to advance against a young, up-and-coming Commanders team. The last time these teams faced off in Philly, the Eagles won, 26-18. Barkey rushed for 146 yards and two scores, while Washington was held to 264 yards.",

      "\u201cYou obviously hear it,\u00a0you gotta prepare for media, and I gotta do questions,\u201d Sirianni told Sports Illustrated\u2019s Albert Breer in December. \u201cBut I also gotta practice what I preach. And if I\u2019m gonna tell these guys not to listen, when the word is out that we\u2019re not any good, or the word\u2019s out that we\u2019re really good, then I need to do the same thing. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve tried to do. \u2026 My job is to lead this football team, along with the captains and the leaders we have, and put my head down and go to work.\u201d",
      "Has Sirianni earned more patience moving forward? It\u2019s not so simple.",

      "It\u2019s not impossible another poor stretch or more tension with Hurts could both become issues for Sirianni again in the future. But it would be hard for Philadelphia, or any team, to find a coach who wins as much as Sirianni does."

      "Yes, a wide range of movies were recognized with nominations, but some performances and efforts were overlooked \u2014 the dreaded, so-called \u201csnub.\u201d And where there\u2019s a snub, there may also be a surprise \u2014 a film or performance that earned a nomination pundits may not have seen coming.",

      "Snubs:",
      "The two-time Oscar winner is an Academy Awards favorite with a total of nine acting nominations, but he got shut out this year for \u201cGladiator II.\u201d As a matter of fact, the whole movie only picked up one nomination \u2014 costume design.",
      "Like Washington, Kidman is another perpetual Oscar darling with five nominations in her career, but no dice this time for her role in \u201cBabygirl.\u201d She had earned plenty of critical acclaim, nabbing best actress from the National Board of Review, but she couldn\u2019t get a nomination here.",
      "The former \u201cBaywatch\u201d star had generated some serious buzz for her performance as a dancer in a Las Vegas revue in \u201cThe Last Showgirl.\u201d She even earned a Golden Globe nomination for the part, but it didn\u2019t translate to Oscar recognition. Her co-star Jamie Lee Curtis also failed to pick up a nomination.",
      "It may be hard to believe, but Jolie hasn\u2019t been nominated since 2009 and her only other nomination came when she won in 2000 for \u201cGirl, Interrupted.\u201d It felt like her streak would be snapped thanks to her role as opera singer Maria Callas in \u201cMaria,\u201d but it was not to be.",
      "His role as an American in 1950s Mexico who becomes obsessed with a younger man in \u201cQueer\u201d had netted him multiple nominations from various outlets, but he couldn\u2019t score an Oscar nomination. The veteran actor, best known for playing James Bond, has yet to be nominated for an Academy Award in his career.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d is this year\u2019s most nominated film, with 14 nods, but Gomez, who is arguably the biggest star in the movie, was not among them.",

That couldn't sway voters, though, who didn't reward her with an Academy Award nomination.",

Now, she's picked up a nomination for best actress for \u201cThe Substance,\u201d which followed her Golden Globe win for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture, musical or comedy. The movie itself got plenty of other Oscar love, too, tallying five total nods, including ones for best picture and best director for Coralie Fargeat.",
      "Star Sebastian Stan is up for best actor for his portrayal of a younger Donald Trump in the controversial movie, which snagged a pair of nominations. Jeremy Strong earned the film's other nod, for best supporting actor.",

      "Torres is not a household name, but she may be soon. While Kidman and Jolie were left out in the Oscar cold, Torres is nominated for best actress for \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d building on her Golden Globe victory for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture, drama \u2014 in which she beat a field filled with such stars as Kidman, Jolie and Kate Winslet.",

      "\"I'd like the record to reflect that Jenna, she just likes to troll me,\" Savannah said before smiling. \"She looked right at me (while making the 'SNL' suggestion). When you announced your earring thing Jenna goes, 'Let's do that and it'll make Savannah jealous, which is one of my favorite things.'\""

    "story": [
      "A quarter-century after the U.S. handed control of the Panama Canal to Panama, President Donald Trump wants to take it back.",
      "Early this month, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to regain control of the canal from Panama, one of the U.S.'s closest allies in Latin America, describing it as \u201cvital\u201d for national security.",
      "But his gripe is more with U.S. rival China, which he says is \u201coperating\u201d a critical waterway that serves as a transit point for almost 5% of the world's maritime trade.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump said Monday during his inaugural address. \u201cWe gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Panama strongly rebuked Trump\u2019s comments, with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino saying the canal \u201cis and will continue to be Panama\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Mulino also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that China controls the canal.",
      "\u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\u201d he said Monday in a statement in Spanish.",
      "China said it agreed with the Panamanian president, saying the canal \u201cis not under the direct or indirect control of any power.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina does not participate in the management or operation of the canal and has never interfered in matters related to it,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have always respected Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognized it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "The neutrality of the nearly 50-mile canal, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year, is enshrined in Panama\u2019s Constitution and is enforced by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what has made the Panama Canal so successful, and why it\u2019s still one of the main commercial arteries of the world \u2014 because of this neutrality,\u201d said Beatriz Garc\u00eda Nice, a Latin America program associate at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.",
      "The United States began building the canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The project was completed in 1914 as part of efforts to cut the transit time for U.S. commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.",
      "By the mid-20th century, control of the canal had become a source of tension between the U.S. and Panama, erupting into anti-American riots in 1964 that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. soldiers and more than 20 Panamanians.",
      "On Dec. 31, 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978 in what Trump has called \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d The U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Several international companies that now manage ports along the canal, including the Seattle-based SSA Marine, which operates a cargo terminal on the Atlantic side, won their rights in bidding processes that were described as fair and nondiscriminatory by U.S. officials at the time.",
      "In 1997, Hutchison Ports, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong that manages 53 ports around the world, won the rights to manage two ports \u2014 Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "The Trump administration argues that China could use those ports to turn the Panama Canal into a \u201cchoke point\u201d against the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf these companies control both ends of that canal in a time of conflict, and the Chinese tell them, \u2018Shut it down and don\u2019t let the U.S. go through there,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a big, big problem,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week during his Senate confirmation hearing, \u201ca big economic problem and a big national security and defense problem.\u201d",
      "Though at opposite ends of the canal, the ports are not gateways to the waterway \u2014 ships do not have to pass through them to enter the canal. Instead, the ports mostly serve as places to handle cargo.",
      "\u201cIt would take an act of war, effectively, for the Chinese to shut it down,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a port company to shut down a canal.\u201d",
      "Trump also claimed that the U.S. has been \u201covercharged\u201d for its ships to sail through the canal, saying that Panama was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the treaty.",
      "\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy,\u201d he said in the inaugural address.",
      "Because the waterway, which is fed by a freshwater lake, is seeing its water levels decrease because of a warming climate, the Panama Canal Authority has limited the number of ships that can pass through daily and raised fees for all ships regardless of the country they belong to.",
      "\u201cThe fees have been raised across the board in a professional, transparent manner, nothing less, nothing more,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cIt is simply like any different toll that is managed professionally and independently.\u201d",
      "Sabatini and Nice say the growing accusations could hurt U.S. relations with Panama, where China has been making inroads.",
      "\u201cWhat this is doing is questioning even further if the United States is a reliable partner, especially in face of the Chinese influence that is already in the region,\u201d Nice said.",
      "As for Trump\u2019s threat to use military force to retake the canal, Sabatini said such a drastic action would require Senate approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an international treaty, it was approved by the U.S. Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that the executive can unilaterally decide to revoke.\u201d",
      "Still, the Panama Canal Authority has launched an audit of Hutchison Ports, which Nice said was an attempt to placate Washington.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to not confront one of your biggest allies and are saying, \u2018If this is going to help and sort of bring down the temperature, then we will do it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchison Ports said it was fully cooperating with the audit and remained committed \u201cto excellence and ethics in each of our operations,\u201d Bloomberg News reported, citing a statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Trump also vastly overstated the number of Americans killed during construction of the canal, saying 38,000 lives were lost. About 5,600 out of 56,000 workers are believed to have died from injury or disease during the U.S. phase of construction, according to the Panama Canal Authority, most of whom were from the Caribbean.",
      "For many Panamanians, the canal\u2019s independence is a matter of pride.",
      "\u201cThe Canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999,\u201d President Mulino said. \u201cSince then until now, for 25 years, without interruption, we have managed and expanded it responsibly to serve the world and its commerce, including the United States.\u201d"

      "Russia",
      "The president previously claimed he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. \u201cThis is only half a day. I have another half a day left,\u201d he said Monday.",
      "That idea sparked alarm in Europe, which worries that Trump could force Ukraine into a negotiation that favors Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has more recently stretched this timeline to as long as six months, which some have taken as a signal of support for Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, Trump appeared to criticize Putin \u2014 one of the authoritarian leaders he has spoken warmly about in the past, saying he is \u201cnot doing so well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not making him look very good,\u201d Trump said of how the war is going for Putin, adding that he was \u201cdestroying Russia by not making a deal.\u201d",

      "During his first term, Trump alarmed European leaders by suggesting he might not defend them against Russia unless they paid more toward defense. He reiterated his latest demand Monday for those countries to contribute 5% of their gross domestic products toward defense, more than double NATO's recommendation.",
      "He has also unnerved Denmark by suggesting he might take its autonomous territory of Greenland by force.",
      "Climate change",

      "The U.S. is by far the WHO\u2019s biggest financial backer, providing 18% of its $6.8 billion budget. Signing an executive order to leave the WHO, Trump said that China\u2019s lower contribution but higher population \u201cseems a little unfair to me.\u201d",

      "Instead, he brought to the negotiating table decades of experience clinching some of New York\u2019s biggest real estate deals, as well as opening up about his very personal loss during the arduous talks.",
      "Born in the Bronx, the billionaire real estate developer could hardly have a more different profile from those of the American diplomats who usually craft complicated international agreements.

      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani made a clear reference to Witkoff, who is Jewish and has done business throughout the Middle East, during a Wednesday press conference confirming that a Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal had been reached.",
      "\u201cWhat we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration transcending both administrations, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. to reach to that deal,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed, a key mediator in the talks, told the crowd of reporters and dignitaries, which included Witkoff himself. \u201cAnd I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us in the last couple of days, and they played a vital role in reaching to this moment.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official close to the negotiations also told NBC News that Witkoff had been \u201cvery helpful, in particular ironing out a couple of issues\u201d on the \u201cvery complex deal.\u201d They added that he had been \u201cworking seamlessly\u201d on the effort with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",

      "Witkoff brought \u201ca new energy and a new dynamic\u201d to the table, a person familiar with the negotiations said in a separate interview before the deal was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s very much engaged and his heart is in the right place.\u201d",
      "A Middle Eastern diplomat who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity said Witkoff, as well as being a tough negotiator, talked about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 at age 22, telling \u201cofficials he empathizes with parents who have lost children on both sides.\u201d",

    "summary": "Panama\u2019s control of the canal that bears its name should not be returned to the United States despite President Donald Trump\u2019s calls of \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Panamanians say.",

      "Panama\u2019s control of the canal that bears its name should not be returned to the United States despite President Donald Trump\u2019s calls of \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Panamanians say.",
      "Although most people thought the matter was closed when Panama officially took control of canal operations from the United States in 1999, the issue reared its head during his campaign when he suggested the engineering marvel that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans was being run by China and should return to U.S. control.",
      "Trump repeated that claim in his inaugural speech this week, saying, \u201cChina is operating the Panama Canal,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re taking it back.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Panama during a Latin-American and Caribbean tour that starts late next week.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Panama\u2019s President Jose Raul Mulino dismissed the notion as he and other Panamanian leaders tried to gain international support this week for keeping the canal under their nation\u2019s authority.",
      "Among those leaders is Jorge Luis Quijano, a former canal administrator, who insists Panamanians are running the waterway, not the Chinese. He also disputed Trump\u2019s complaint that U.S. ships pay more to pass through the canal than other countries.",
      "\u201cA ship with a Panamanian flag pays as much as an American-flagged ship,\u201d Quijano said, adding that rates are based on a vessel\u2019s size, and large container ships may pay as much as $1.2 million to pass through the 51-mile waterway that cuts through the Isthmus of Panama.",
      "Quijano said he started working at the canal in 1975 after graduating as an engineer from Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, when the United States still controlled it. He said Americans were the supervisors when he started, but Panamanians eventually became the managers and \u201cthe Americans retired.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw the whole movie,\u201d Quijano said jokingly about witnessing the transition over the 44 years he worked at the canal, eventually becoming vice president of operations and leading a reconstruction effort that expanded the channel\u2019s capacity in 2016.",
      "Humberto Arcia, 72, who lived two miles from the canal in the Chorrillo neighborhood as a child, said he will never forget the price Panamians paid for the right to run the canal in their own country.",
      "The Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty signed in 1903 gave the United States the right to build and manage the Panama Canal. Construction began in 1904 after a failed attempt by a French construction team to build the ambitious passage.",
      "The massive project took the lives of more than 5,000 construction workers, 350 of them U.S. citizens, until its completion in 1914. Most of the workers were from Caribbean nations.",
      "Panama\u2019s relationship with the United States was marked by riots and demonstrations opposing\u00a0American involvement in the Central American nation\u2019s affairs and control over the canal.",
      "In 1964, anti-American riots broke out in Panama because the Panamanian flag was not allowed to fly next to the U.S. flag at Balboa High School in the U.S.-controlled Canal Zone that was attended by American students, according to the U.S. National Archives. The Canal Zone was a 10-mile concession of the United States where canal employees and their families lived.",
      "The protests escalated and students from multiple high schools outside the Canal Zone marched to its entrance, where at least 20 people were killed in clashes with the U.S. military, National Guard and Canal Zone Police during three days of riots. The protests are commemorated each year on Jan. 9, a national holiday, known as the Day of Martyrs.",
      "Arcia, a retired banker and attorney, remembers hearing relatives of the students talk about their loss when he lived near the Canal. \u201cTheir suffering changed the lives of their families forever,\u201d he said.",
      "The riots were a turning point in Panama\u2019s history, but it wasn\u2019t until 1977 that President Jimmy Carter and the Panamanian military leader Omar Torrijos signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaty that would eventually lead to Panamanian oversight.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority assumed full control on Dec. 31, 1999.",
      "U.S. historian David McCullough wrote in his book \u201cThe Path Between the Seas\u201d: \u201cThe fifty miles between the oceans were among the hardest ever won by human effort and ingenuity, and no statistics on tonnage or tolls can begin to convey the grandeur of what was accomplished. Primarily the canal is an expression of that old and noble desire to bridge the divide, to bring people together. It is a work of civilization.\u201d",
      "The Panama Canal was designated one of the seven wonders of the modern world in 1994.",
      "Today, the canal is one of the United States\u2019 most important trade routes and the top revenue source for Panama. The canal generates yearly revenues above $5 billion to the country\u2019s coffers, according to the U.S. State Department.",
      "The ships that pass through generate income, but the canal also attracts businesses that create jobs in industries such as logistics, insurance and banking, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).",
      "Panamanians said the canal is part of their national identity.",
      "Panamanian business consultant Marjorie Miller said her great-grandfather, John Miller, moved to Panama from Jamaica to work at the canal. U.S. Census Bureau records show he lived in the American labor camp known as the Red Tank with other canal workers.",
      "\u201cI always knew how important the canal was to our country because of my ancestors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Panama Canal is Panama. It is our greatest asset.\u201d",
      "Miller said she is frustrated by comments posted by Panamanians on social media about how the United States could probably do a better job running the canal than Panama.",
      "\u201cThe comments come from ignorance,\u201d she said, adding that many younger people in her country lack the historical knowledge to understand the importance of the canal for the country.",
      "Miller also said that Trump\u2019s comments about China\u2019s involvement in the canal\u2019s operations may have arisen because Panama broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2017 and established ties with China instead.",
      "\u201cWe were friends one day, and now we are hearing, \u2018We want your canal,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big change when the U.S. is our greatest trading partner.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Mao Ning, said at a Wednesday news briefing that Trump\u2019s comments about China and the canal are baseless.",
      "\u201cPanama\u2019s sovereignty and independence are not negotiable, and the Panama Canal is not under direct or indirect control by any power,\u201d Ning said. \u201cChina does not take part in managing or operating the canal. Never ever has China interfered. We respect Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the Canal and recognize it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "Quijano, the former vice president of operations, said he doubts the United States could easily run the canal because it takes 12 years of training for an engineer to learn the complicated system of locks and water elevators that route giant ships through the canal.",
      "\u201cIf he thinks he is going to take it back and then we are going to run it for him, the answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us just need to respect the treaties and the sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "Arcia, who grew up near the canal, said Trump needs to change his tone toward Panama: \u201cWhat we always want is a beautiful relationship of equality, not submission.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threats aimed at strong-arming Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine have been badly received by some politicians and nationalists in Russia who say his tactics bode ill for a deal.",
      "Trump said on Wednesday he would likely impose new sanctions, taxes and tariffs on Russia, whose economy he said was failing, and on Moscow\u2019s allies, unless President Vladimir Putin struck a deal with him \u201csoon\u201d to end the conflict.",
      "In an apparent attempt to balance his threat with a compliment, Trump spoke of the need to never forget that Russia had helped the United States win World War II and incorrectly stated that the then Soviet Union had lost 60 million people in that conflict as opposed to the 26.6 million people estimated by the Russian authorities.",
      "Putin and Trump have yet to speak by phone since his inauguration and, with ties with the new administration at an early stage, the Kremlin played down Trump\u2019s threat, saying it \u201cdid not see any particularly new elements here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe carefully record all the nuances. We remain ready for dialogue, President Putin has repeatedly spoken about this \u2014 for equal dialogue, for mutually respectful dialogue,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",
      "Peskov took issue though with Trump\u2019s statement on World War II, saying it was the Soviet Union which had made the biggest contribution to victory over Nazi Germany. He also pointed out Trump\u2019s mistake on the number of war dead.",
      "Others spoke more plainly, saying that what they cast as Trump\u2019s heavy-handed attitude towards Russia made a peace deal less likely.",
      "Konstantin Kosachyov, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament, noted that Trump had not made any demands on Ukraine in the same post on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cIt confirms that his level of understanding of the causes, current state and prospects for resolving the Ukrainian crisis is approximately at the same level as his understanding of the course and outcome of World War II,\u201d Kosachyov said in a statement. \u201cThat is to say, lower than the skirting board, which cannot but be a cause for regret and concern.\u201d",
      "Influential war bloggers, read by millions of Russians and licensed by the authorities, expressed outrage.",
      "One of them, Voenkor Kotonok, said Trump\u2019s statement was \u201cinsulting, arrogant and self-satisfied.\u201d Another, war correspondent Alexander Kots, speculated that the Middle East ceasefire had given Trump a misplaced sense of omnipotence.",
      "\u201cRussia is not the Gaza Strip. And starting a dialogue with ultimatums is not the most far-sighted move on the part of a leader claiming to be a peacemaker. Moscow will never agree to any deals dictated by blackmail and threats,\u201d Kots wrote.",
      "Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said Trump\u2019s actions so far suggested he would not be able to bring peace to Ukraine, while Vladimir Solovyov, a high-profile state media talk show host, said Trump\u2019s threats proved he was an enemy.",
      "\u201cIs that any way to talk to great Russia?,\u201d an angry Solovyov told his listeners.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin speech writer now designated a \u201cforeign agent\u201d by Russia, was among those who said he thought Trump\u2019s strong-arm approach could backfire, a reference to the belief that Putin does not like to do anything under public pressure that could be interpreted as a sign of weakness.",
      "\u201cTrump could have afforded to take his time (on Ukraine), but he has decided not to drag things out and is slowly starting to apply pressure (on Russia),\u201d Gallyamov wrote on his blog.",
      "\u201cThere is a risk here that Putin will bite back and get in a standoff.\u201d"

      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) named\u00a0Yoon, the first sitting president to be arrested in\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u2019s history, as the ringleader of an insurrection, also involving his defense minister at the time.",
      "The dramatic events of recent weeks have plunged\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0into a political crisis that has\u00a0dragged on the economy\u00a0and raised concerns among allies, including the U.S., about the country\u2019s political stability.",
      "Yoon, impeached and suspended from power on Dec. 14, has been\u00a0incarcerated\u00a0since last week pending an investigation into his Dec. 3 attempt to impose martial law \u2014 a move that shocked the nation even though it was overturned within hours by parliament.",
      "The CIO was established in 2021 as an independent anti-graft agency to investigate high-ranking officials including the president and their family members and has led a joint\u00a0team\u00a0involving police and the defense ministry, while prosecutors carry out their own inquiry.",
      "Under the law, the CIO can only investigate\u00a0the president, not\u00a0prosecute, and must refer any case to the prosecutors\u2019 office for further action.",
      "The CIO has said\u00a0Yoon\u2019s detention is due to end around Jan. 28, but they expect prosecutors to ask the court to extend it for another 10 days before they formally charge the president.",
      "The Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office declined to comment.",
      "Prosecutors have already charged\u00a0Yoon\u2019s defense minister at the time, Kim Yong-hyun, with insurrection. Chiefs of the Capital Defense Command, the Defense Counterintelligence Command, and the Seoul police and the national police commissioner are also among the officials indicted so far.",
      "Since his arrest on Jan.\u00a015,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0has refused to speak to CIO investigators and defied their summons.",
      "Lee Jae-seung, deputy chief of the CIO, said it would be more \u201cefficient\u201d for the prosecutors to take over the investigation before indicting\u00a0Yoon, citing the president\u2019s refusal to cooperate.",
      "\u201cDespite the fact that the suspect is under serious allegations that he was ringleader of an insurrection, he continues to be uncooperative to this day, not responding to the criminal justice proceedings and refusing our questioning itself,\u201d Lee told a briefing.",
      "He said investigators had obtained testimonies from several military officials on\u00a0Yoon\u00a0allegedly trying to arrest politicians and mentioning a second martial law order.\u00a0Yoon\u00a0and his lawyers denied these allegations.",
      "Yoon, a top prosecutor before becoming president, now finds his criminal case in the hands of prosecutors from that same world, though how close their current ties are is unclear.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly said the CIO has no authority to handle his case as the law stipulates a wide-ranging list of high-ranking officials and violations it can investigate, but has no mention of insurrection.",
      "A Seoul court ruled against\u00a0Yoon\u2019s lawyers when they tried to make that argument to prevent his arrest.",
      "Yoon\u2019s team also\u00a0said any criminal investigation should be conducted after the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove\u00a0Yoon\u00a0from office in its separate trial on his impeachment.",
      "The lawyers reiterated the position on Thursday to say they will hold the CIO accountable for what they called its illegal investigation, while asking prosecutors taking over the case to comply with the law.",
      "In comments on Tuesday to the Constitutional Court,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0denied ordering troops to drag lawmakers out of parliament or asking the finance minister to prepare a budget for an emergency legislative body.",
      "Insurrection, the crime that\u00a0Yoon\u00a0may be charged with, is one of the few that a\u00a0South\u00a0Korean president does not have immunity from and is technically punishable by death.\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, however, has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years.",
      "Yoon\u00a0attended another\u00a0Constitutional Court hearing in his impeachment trial on Thursday afternoon.",
      "His\u00a0lawyers repeated the president\u2019s earlier argument that he never intended to fully impose martial law, but had meant the measures as a warning to break political deadlock.",
      "In his first public appearance since attempting suicide in jail last month, former defense minister Kim appeared as a witness at Thursday\u2019s hearing and argued that the small number of troops mobilized proved that\u00a0Yoon\u00a0was not serious about imposing military control."

      "That also exceeded the 23% share reported for 2017, when President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0began his first term and started raising tariffs on Chinese goods.",
      "In addition to U.S.-China tensions, \u201cone of the major impacts that we\u2019ve seen in the last five years was Covid and how China closed itself off from the world because of Covid,\u201d Michael Hart, the Beijing-based president of AmCham China, told reporters Thursday.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s been one of the largest triggers as people realized they needed to diversify their supply chains,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that trend slowing down.\u201d",

      "More than 60% of the respondents said U.S.-China tensions were the biggest challenge for doing business in China in the year ahead.

      "Looking ahead, however, tech, industrial and consumer businesses said they viewed growth in domestic consumption as the top business opportunity for 2025, the survey said. Services firms said their top opportunity was Chinese companies looking to expand overseas.",

      "\u201cTravel has been canceled for people who had plans,\" said Kathie O\u2019Callaghan, the president of Hearts and Homes for Refugees, a nonprofit based in Westchester County, N.Y., that resettles families from around the world.\u00a0\u201cMany of these families were very close to arriving and will be in limbo.\u201d",
      "There are hundreds of small groups like O'Callaghan's as well as larger organizations such as churches and international nonprofits that work with the federal government to resettle refugees around the country.",
      "Advocates say data shows refugees are not an excessive drain on government resources and tend to go on to be successfully employed after receiving initial public assistance upon arrival. The rate of employment and participation in the labor force for refugees exceeds that of the U.S. population as a whole, according to\u00a0studies.",
      "Refugees are also subject to more elaborate security vetting than immigrants to the U.S., experts say.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a longtime advocate for refugees, said she was \u201calarmed\u201d by the executive order to suspend the program.",
      "\"Stepping away from this program at a time of unprecedented displacement will put refugees\u2019 lives at risk and ultimately weaken our nation\u2019s long-term security,\" Shaheen said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the program's suspension.",
      "The U.S. refugee resettlement program was largely decimated under the first Trump administration due to restructuring, budget cuts and the impact of the pandemic.",
      "The Biden administration began rebuilding it, and was still working on it up until Trump took office. The just over 100,000 refugees resettled in the U.S. in the 2024 fiscal year represented a historical milestone: the most refugees resettled in the United States in three decades and a dramatic shift from the 11,454 refugees admitted into the country just three years earlier.",
      "The U.S. government has not yet posted refugee figures for the current fiscal year, according to World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization.",
      "From October through December 2024, \"more than 27,000 refugees were admitted to the United States, 2,241 of whom were resettled by World Relief in collaboration with local church partners across the country,\" the organization said in a statement, noting that nearly 70% of those resettled refugees fled a threat of persecution in five countries: Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Syria and Venezuela.",
      "The International Rescue Committee, a high-profile nonprofit refugee assistance group, called the decision \u201ca step backwards.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis country has been a leader in refugee resettlement,\u201d the committee's president and CEO, David Miliband, said. \u201cThe refugee resettlement program is a proven, orderly, cost-effective way of offering life-saving protection to some of the most vulnerable people in the world.\u201d",
      "Afghans at risk",
      "The suspension of the program leaves tens of thousands of Afghan refugees at risk, many of whom have already been vetted by the U.S., advocacy groups say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable to abandon them,\u201d said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of U.S. veterans and advocacy groups, noting that many of those remaining in Afghanistan are at great risk there.",
      "\"It sends a message to our allies around the world that we're with you until it's inconvenient, or with you until our administration changes,\" he said. \"They need to be able to trust the word that our diplomats and our service members give to them.\"",
      "The change does not affect the Special Immigrant Visa program, a separate immigration pathway for Afghans who have worked for the U.S. government or military, including the tens of thousands who have served as translators for the U.S. military since 2001.",
      "Afghans who served in the Afghan military or who campaigned for human rights, but did not work directly for the U.S. military or embassy, are not eligible for the special immigrant visas and have to apply through the refugee program.",
      "The Taliban has targeted Afghans who served in the Afghan government and security forces, as well as journalists and civil society activists, beating, detaining and killing an unknown number, according to human rights organizations and the United Nations.",
      "The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has documented evidence of the Taliban committing extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and torture against specific groups, including media workers, human rights defenders and people affiliated with the former government.",
      "An Afghan woman resettled in the U.S. told NBC News that her parents were supposed to be on a Jan. 30 flight from Afghanistan to the United States, but she did not know whether the flight would go ahead. The family has not yet heard from the State Department about the planned flight.",
      "\u201cWe are so worried especially for my dad because he is hiding for three years. It is so hard for my family,\u201d said the woman, who spoke on the condition that her name not be used due to what she said are threats from the Taliban against her father, who served in the Afghan police and worked closely with the U.S. government before the Taliban came into power in 2021.",
      "In his first message to the U.S. diplomatic corps, Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent a State Department-wide memo setting priorities in line with the second Trump administration, including, \u201cCurbing Mass Migration and Securing Our Borders.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe era of mass migration must end. This Department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage it,\u201d Rubio wrote in the note obtained by NBC News. \u201cAnd diplomacy with other nations, especially in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America\u2019s borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants.\u201d",
      "But the administration\u2019s priorities on refugees may be at odds with some of its supporters. Earlier this month, before Monday\u2019s inauguration, several evangelical Christian organizations urged Trump to maintain the refugee program to ensure Christians facing persecution abroad can find safety in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful for President-elect Trump\u2019s commitment to ensuring that our nation\u2019s borders are strong and secure. We also appreciate and affirm his recent call to ensure systems so that immigrants \u2018with love for the country\u2019 are able \u2018to come in legally,\u2019\u201d the Christian groups said in a Jan. 14 statement.",
      "Trump has received strong support from evangelical voters, including in his election victory in November, and has promised to protect Christians from what he has portrayed as discrimination in American society.",
      "Out of the roughly 100,000 refugees admitted to the United States last year, nearly 30,000 were Christians from countries accused of persecuting the Christian community, according to the nonprofit Open Doors."

    "summary": "More than 2,400 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas took effect.",
    "story": [
      "More than 2,400 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip since the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas took effect, according to United Nations officials, as attention shifted to rebuilding the enclave devastated during 15 months of intensive Israeli bombardment.",
      "During the conflict, aid flows to the blockaded enclave were severely restricted.",
      "As the truce entered its fourth day Wednesday, video from Reuters showed convoys of trucks carrying humanitarian aid rolling into Rafah, in Gaza's south. In one, Palestinians were seen running after the trucks along the city's battered roads as they scrambled to pick up purple plastic aid bags that had fallen off. In another, they were seen picking up plastic water bottles from the ground, flanked by the ruins of damaged buildings.",
      "The U.N. previously estimated that around 60% of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed, including schools and hospitals. Aid and fuel deliveries were severely restricted during the conflict, prompting international criticism of Israel.",
      "More than 47,000 people have been killed in Israeli bombing during the conflict, according to local health officials. Meanwhile, around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population \u2014 almost 1.9 million people \u2014 have been displaced from their homes and forced to live in tent camps and other makeshift shelters, according to the United Nations.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Israeli officials must allow at least 600 truckloads of aid, including 50 carrying fuel, to enter Gaza daily during the initial six weeks. Half of those trucks will be directed to Gaza\u2019s north, where experts had warned famine was imminent.",
      "A senior U.N. official told Reuters on Wednesday that so far, there had been no apparent law-and-order issues in ensuring the flow of aid into the besieged area. Looters and criminal gangs have raided aid trucks during the conflict, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that killed 1,200 and saw some 250 taken hostage.",
      "The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the aid would extend to providing food assistance and health care, including opening bakeries, restocking hospitals, repairing water networks and shelters, and reuniting families.",
      "In the al-Dahra area in central Khan Younis, NBC News captured video of uniformed officers from al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing, stationed along the streets to supervise trucks and ensure the safe delivery of aid into the city Monday.",
      "Abdul Wahab Abdul Raouf Samour, 40, a police officer, was deployed to patrol the streets and facilitate the traffic along the enclave.",
      "\"We were informed by the Interior Ministry to wear military uniforms and military suits and head directly to work,\" he told NBC News' team Monday, adding that Palestinian officials had instructed those deployed to ensure security measures were in place to prevent looting.",
      "\"As you see, we are facilitating the traffic movement for the cities, and, God willing, we hope to serve our people more than this,\" he added.",
      "Across the enclave, video captured by NBC News showed scenes of ash-covered buildings and streets lined with the shattered debris from homes and shops. Other drone footage captured Gaza before and after the 15 months of the war, showing how its cities had been decimated.",
      "But even the promise of a ceasefire could not protect some Palestinians in Gaza looking to rebuild their lives as Israeli airstrikes continued in Khan Younis on Monday.",
      "When Ahmed Qudra, 35, stepped out of his home to buy his seven children chicken wings from the market, he was killed by Israeli missiles that struck a vehicle carrying security forces and killed four security officers. The attack also took the lives of three of Qudra\u2019s children while injuring two others.",
      "\u201cWe went to bed believing the ceasefire started at 8:30. How could we have known that things had changed? How could we have known our happiness would turn into devastation?\u201d  Hanan, Qudra\u2019s wife, told NBC News' ground crew through tears.",
      "\u201cOn Friday, we asked him to bring us chicken wings. He said he would. Now he\u2019s gone,\u201d said 12-year-old son Adel, who saw his father and siblings killed."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry and his legal team thrashed out a last-minute deal with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper group Wednesday to settle claims of widespread wrongdoing at the publisher. The prince received a \u201cfull apology\u201d but fell short of his mission to hold British tabloids accountable in open court.",
      "The Duke of Sussex\u2019s decision to settle his claims against News Group Newspapers (NGN) ends his efforts expose the misdeeds of the publisher of The Sun and long-shuttered News of the World in open trial.",
      "Along with former lawmaker Tom Watson, Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, had sued NGN over alleged unlawful activities carried out by journalists and private investigators working for the newspapers.",
      "The group, which had long denied the allegations, offered what it called a \u201cfull and unequivocal apology\u201d to Harry \u201cfor the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life.\u201d",
      "In the British civil court system, a settlement often involves the accused covering the claimant's legal fees, as well as handing over an additional cash payment.",
      "NGN said it was sorry for intruding into the private life of Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales and apologized to Harry \u201cfor the phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by journalists and private investigators instructed by them at the News of the World.\u201d",
      "Outside the London court where the trial had been due to take place, David Sherborne \u2014 the lawyer representing Harry and Watson \u2014 read out a statement on their behalf.",
      "\u201cAfter endless resistance, denials and legal battles by News Group Newspapers, including spending more than a billion pounds in payouts and in legal costs (as well as paying-off those in the know) to prevent the full picture from coming out, News UK [NGN\u2019s parent company] is finally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law,\u201d Sherborne said.",
      "Sherborne\u2019s statement added that \u201cPrince Harry and his immediate family have also had to repeatedly withstand aggressive and vengeful coverage since starting his claim over five years ago,\u201d which   he said had left them concerned for their safety.",
      "\u201cToday the lies are laid bare. Today, the cover-ups are exposed. And today proves that no one stands above the law,\u201d he said.",
      "Harry first brought the lawsuit against NGN in 2019 and the eight-week trial was supposed to start Tuesday. He had been expected to testify for several days next month.",
      "But in a surprising twist \u2014 one that angered Judge Timothy Fancourt \u2014 both sides on Tuesday asked for more time to thrash out a deal.\u00a0When Fancourt refused to allow a further delay until Wednesday, attorneys on both sides said they would go to the Court of Appeal to challenge his ruling, stalling the start of the trial.",
      "Ahead of the trial, Sherborne alleged the newspapers had used deception to obtain his clients' medical, phone and flight records, as well as bugging homes and placing listening devices into cars.\u00a0He also alleged that executives destroyed documents and used other methods to conceal the chicanery.",
      "NGN also issued what it called a \u201cfull and unequivocal apology\u201d to Watson \u201cfor the unwarranted intrusion carried out into his private life during his time in Government by the News of the World during the period 2009-2011.\u201d",
      "When serving as a member of Parliament, Watson played a significant role in the initial inquiry into alleged phone-hacking by members of the British newspaper media. He also wrote a book charting the relationship between Murdoch-owned titles and politicians.",
      "NGN's apology said Watson had been \u201cplaced under surveillance in 2009 by journalists at the News of the World and those instructed by them.\u201d The former deputy leader of the Labour Party, it added, had also been awarded \u201csubstantial damages.\u201d",
      "Harry, meanwhile, began positioning himself at odds with the royal family\u2019s famous \u201cnever complain, never explain\u201d attitude on the matter two years ago. He became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court since Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, did so in the late 19th century.",
      "Harry revealed in court papers that his father opposed his litigation, but although other claimants including celebrities, sports stars and politicians settled cases with NGN, he had always said his mission was not to receive money but to get to the truth.",
      "NGN has already paid out hundreds of millions of pounds to victims of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by the News of the World but it has always denied there was wrongdoing at The Sun. It has also rejected allegations that senior figures knew about the activity or tried to cover it up.",
      "In a separate statement released as well as the apology, a spokesperson for NGN said the apology was \u201cfor incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun, not by journalists, during the period 1996-2011.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are strong controls and processes in place at all our titles today to ensure this cannot happen now.\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "The spokesperson also denied that Watson\u2019s phone was hacked. \u201cHad this gone to trial, NGN would have called evidence from telecoms experts to demonstrate that hacking after 2007 was nigh on impossible due to security upgrades undertaken by telecoms companies,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Even if he had gone to trial and won, Harry could still have been on the hook for a multimillion-pound legal bill. Under English civil law, a claimant who wins a court judgment that is lower than what they were offered to settle, has to pay the legal bills for both sides. The law is designed to discourage lengthy trials.",
      "Actor Hugh Grant had been a claimant with Harry, but said in April that he was forced to accept \u201can enormous amount of money\u201d to settle his case as he could have otherwise faced a large legal bill."
