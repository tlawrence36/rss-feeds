      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d is dominating the box office in its opening weekend in North America",
      "\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d has powered up the box office once again. The sequel opened in 3,412 theaters in the U.S. and Canada this weekend and far surpassed expectations with $63 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Seemingly immune to widely negative reviews, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d notched the biggest opening ever for the weekend after Thanksgiving, which usually is a more muted buffet of leftovers. It\u2019s also the biggest opening of the year for a PG-13 rated movie and the second biggest horror opening, behind \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites.\u201d The movies and the game are about a family restaurant, Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza, whose anthropomorphic robots turn murderous at night.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of doom and gloom about the industry overall, but this movie helped drive the industry to the biggest first weekend post-Thanksgiving ever,\" said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal.",
      "The first film, also a Blumhouse production, was a surprise hit two years ago. It opened to $80 million in October 2023, despite also being available to stream on Peacock. Universal decided to open the sequel exclusively in theaters. With a reported production price tag of only $36 million, \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d is on its way to being another smash. It\u2019s another reminder of the potential massive upside of theatrical releases as many in the industry and out wonder what Netflix\u2019s acquisition of Warner Bros. will mean for moviegoing.",
      "The sequel, written by the game\u2019s creator Scott Cawthon, saw the return of cast members like Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard and Elizabeth Lail as well as director Emma Tammi. Reviews were dismal, even worse than the first. Mark Kennedy, in his zero star review for The Associated Press, called it an \u201cincoherent mess.\u201d But horror fans have been known to turn out for opening weekends regardless of reviews. This audience had a decidedly more positive take. According to PostTrak polling data, 70% of ticket buyers said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d recommend \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to their friends.",
      "Paul Dergarabedian, the head of marketplace trends for Comscore, said that the teen video gamer audience is sometimes underestimated and this weekend proves once again that given the right film, will come out to the movie theater for that communal experience with fellow fans.",
      "It was also enough to push the more family-friendly \u201cZootopia 2\u201d into second place in its second weekend in theaters, where it added $43 million in North America. But the Disney film isn\u2019t hurting after its record Thanksgiving opening. With $219 million from 52 territories internationally, including China, the running global total is an eye-popping $915.8 million. It's officially pushed Walt Disney Studio releases over the $5 billion mark globally \u2014 the only studio to do so this year.",
      "\u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d also a Universal release, landed in third place in its third weekend with $16.8 million from 3,985 theaters, brining its domestic total just shy of $297 million.",
      "Fourth place went to Gkids\u2019 anime \u201cJujutsu Kaisen: Execution\u201d which opened to an estimated $10.2 million, while Lionsgate's \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don't\u201d rounded out the top five with $3.5 million, pushing its running global total to $210 million.",
      "\u201cKill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair\u201d was close behind with $3.3 million from 1,198 theaters. Quentin Tarantino combined \u201cKill Bill: Vol. 1\" and \u201cVol. 2\u201d into a four hour and 35-minute epic (including a 15 minute intermission). The Lionsgate release got a rare A+ CinemaScore from an audience that was 72% male. According to the studio, most of the 70mm and 35mm showings were sold out. Due to the demand for the film prints, the studio is exploring an extended run. \u201cKill Bill\u201d star Lucy Liu had a big weekend at New York's AMC Lincoln Square where the independent drama \u201cRosemead\u201d made $50,243 from one screen.",
      "A filmed version of the Tony-winning revival of \u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\u201d starring Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez and released by Sony Pictures Classics, opened just outside of the top 10 with $1.2 million from 1,084 screens.",
      "The running annual domestic box office just this weekend surpassed $8 billion. Since the pandemic, it's only surpassed $9 billion once, in 2023, when \u201cBarbie\u201d topped the year. Prior to 2020, it would regularly hit $11 billion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but every movie is going to have to overperform in some way if we\u2019re going to get to the $9 billion threshold,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",

      "Hungarian author and Nobel Prize for Literature 2025 winner L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, known for his surreal and anarchic novels, gave a rare public lecture in Stockholm on Sunday",
      "STOCKHOLM -- Hungarian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, who won the Nobel Prize in literature for his surreal and anarchic novels that combine a bleak world view with mordant humor, gave a lecture in Stockholm on Sunday in one of his rare public appearances.",
      "The lecture was part of the Nobel week that is underway in Stockholm and Oslo with laureates holding news conferences and giving speeches before they are awarded the prestigious prizes.",
      "Krasznahorkai's lecture, which he gave in Hungarian, ranged across topics such as old and new angels, human dignity, hope or the lack thereof, rebellion and his observations of a clochard \u2014 or tramp \u2014 on the Berlin subway.",
      "He introduced his lecture, according to the English translation, by saying that \u201con receiving the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature, I originally wished to share my thought with you on the subject of hope, but as my stores of hope have definitely come to an end, I will now speak about angels.\u201d",
      "As opposed to \u201cthe angels of old,\u201d the new angels, Krasznahorkai said, \u201chave no wings, but they also have no message, none whatsoever. They are merely here among us in their simple street clothes, unrecognizable if they so wish.",
      "\u201cThey just stand there and look at us, they are searching for our gaze, and in this search there is a plea for us, to look into their eyes, so that we ourselves can transmit a message to them, only that unfortunately, we have no message to give,\u201d the author writes in sad, yet poetic prose.",
      "Expressing himself in his long, winding trademark sentences full of apocalypse but without full stops, he says it comes as a shock when he \u201cdetects the horrific story of these new angels that stand before me, the story that they are sacrifices, sacrifices: and not for us, but because of us, for every single one of us, because of every single one of us, angels without wings and angels without a message, and all the while knowing that there is war, war and only war, war in nature, war in society, and this war is being waged not only with weapons, not only with torture, not only with destruction: of course, this is one end of the scale, but this war proceeds at the opposite of the scale as well, because one single bad word is enough.\u201d",
      "When the Nobel judges announced the award for Krasznahorkai in October, they described the 71-year-old as \u201ca great epic writer\u201d whose work \u201cis characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess.\u201d",
      "\u201cKrasznahorkai\u2019s work can be seen as part of a Central European tradition,\" the Nobel Prize organization said. \u201dImportant features are pessimism and apocalypse, but also humor and unpredictability.\"",

      "In one of the world's most volatile nations, Somalis must be aware of their responsibility to their country and each other, he said in a recital emphasizing good citizenship.",
      "The 70-year-old Barre cut a somber figure at the podium. His message echoed in the largely empty hall of the National Theater in Mogadishu, the capital, where aging poets in austere suits gather to share verses and recall the good old days.",
      "The men, some with hennaed beards and glaucoma eyes, represent a fading measure of hope for a country that has been slowly stripped of its cultural wealth during decades of conflict.",
      "There may be no higher art in Somalia than oral poetry, which is recited in the most remote outposts and even by militants in the bush. Somalis, after all, are often described as \"a nation of poets.\" Their work often venerates pastoral well-being and the traditional roles of men and women in the predominantly Islamic society.",
      "Some poets like Hadraawi \u2014 the \u201cShakespeare of Somalia\u201d who died in 2022 \u2014 have achieved universal recognition. \u201cHadraawi\u2019s oeuvre includes a broad repertoire, from love songs to laments of war,\u201d Harvard University's Archive of World Music noted after his death.",
      "Poets flourished during the reign of Siad Barre, who ruled Somalia with an iron hand but was known to respect the intellectual work of artists. His removal in 1991 by clan-based militias provoked a civil war as warlords fought for authority \u2014 chaos that eventually led to the deadly rise of the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia is now known far more for bombings than poetry. The violence has not spared its cultural institutions, now mostly in limbo as the fragile federal government spends the bulk of its budget on national security.",
      "The National Theater, like the National Museum next door, is largely inactive. To reach the venue in a heavily guarded area near the presidential palace, visitors traveling in a vehicle must notify the intelligence agency in advance, part of security precautions that demand not just the car\u2019s license plate number but even its make and color.",
      "On the morning Hassan Barre sang his poem, a group of young Somalis were practicing a folk dance that emphasized traditional values, like dutifully cultivating the land. A group of poets, including one woman, sat nearby, talking quietly.",
      "Some told The Associated Press they are trying to keep Somalia\u2019s poetic tradition alive despite security concerns and financial challenges that limit programming.",

We expect them to treat us the way we used to be treated.\u201d",
      "Daud Aweis, Somalia's culture minister, said poets still play \u201ca vital role in Somali society, serving as a foundational pillar for cultural vitality, individual well-being and peaceful coexistence.\" While his ministry provides limited funding for culture and the arts at the National Theater, \"the long-term goal is to expand support,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "Inaugurated in 1967, less than a decade after independence, the National Theater shut down in 1991 following Barre's ouster. It reopened in 2012 after African Union peacekeepers pushed al-Shabab fighters out of Mogadishu in a counter-terrorism campaign.",
      "Months later, however, a suicide bomber blew herself up at the theater during a speech by the prime minister, killing the head of Somalia\u2019s Olympic committee and at least seven others. The prime minister survived.",

      "\u201cCary was a rare soul: generous, thoughtful, and endlessly committed to his craft,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cHis loss is immeasurable. My heart is with his family, friends, and all who loved him.\u201d",
      "Tagawa's decades of film and TV roles truly got off the ground in 1987 when he appeared in Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Last Emperor.\" Since then, he appeared in such films as \u201cPearl Harbor,\u201d \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d and \u201cLicense to Kill.\"",
      "Tagawa was raised mostly in the U.S. South while his Hawaii-born father was assigned to U.S. mainland Army bases. He lived in Honolulu and on the Hawaiian island of Kauai for a while.",
      "Tagawa\u2019s father met his mother while stationed in Japan, Tagawa told Honolulu Magazine in 2004. His parents named him after Cary Grant and his brother after Gregory Peck, he said.",
      "His mother, Ayako, had been a stage actor in Japan, according to the Honolulu weekly newspaper Midweek. Tagawa said she asked him not to pursue acting because there weren\u2019t many good roles for Asians.",
      "He eventually began an acting career at age 36 after being a celery farmer, limo driver, pizza supply truck driver and photojournalist, he said.",
      "\u201cThe good news for Asian actors and Hollywood is that it\u2019s better than it\u2019s ever been, but the bad news is that it hasn\u2019t changed that much,\u201d he told Midweek in 2005. \u201cThe opportunities haven\u2019t increased that much, but commercially there\u2019s more exposure.\u201d",

      "It began as a child, performing with her acrobat father who balanced her on a chair atop another chair resting only on his chin. Then later, as an icon of stage and screen during the last years of the shah, her looks and hairstyles were copied by Iranian women who wanted to look more \u201cGoogooshi,\" a Farsi adjective all her own.",
      "Then came the decades of silence after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, barred from performing, only to return to the stage abroad in 2000. And now, embarking on a farewell tour, she's adding author as her latest reinvention as her homeland undergoes a societal change yet again.",
      "\u201cI did not realize that all these challenges and struggles were considered a balancing act,\" the 75-year-old singer told The Associated Press. \"If that is what it means, then yes, I have spent my entire life trying to create and maintain a balance between my personal life and my artistic life.\u201d",
      "The new book by the singer, born Faegheh Atashin, is called \u201cGoogoosh: A Sinful Voice.\u201d In it, Googoosh with the help of co-author Tara Dehlavi recounts a life shaped by both the political forces that have changed Iran in the modern era and her tumultuous personal life.",
      "But it all began with performing at an early age with her father, Saber Atashin, to whom the book is dedicated along with the people of Iran. Googoosh recounts falling only once in the shows, her father catching her. But from the first performance atop the chair, Googoosh appeared bound for the spotlight.",
      "\u201cThey held their breath and waited in complete silence,\u201d she recounted. \u201cEvery muscle in my body tensed. Seconds felt like an eternity. Finally, Papa slowly began to lower me gently toward the ground. When my feet touched the floor, the audience sighed in relief before they erupted into roaring applause. I had survived. And we were a hit!\u201d",
      "Googoosh began singing and performing in films at a young age. That included before the royal court of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who later became mortally ill and fled Iran just before the 1979 revolution.",
      "Googoosh had been tabloid fodder in Iran before the revolution. Married four times in her life, her personal life long had been a fascination. And within her book, she recounts undergoing abortions and battling with substance abuse around and after the revolution, including freebasing cocaine and smoking opium. She considers suicide at one point in New York City before deciding to go back to Iran under its newly formed theocracy.",
      "\u201cThere were times where I would ask this question to you and say, \u2018Are you sure you want to share this?\u2019\" Dehlavi, her co-author said. \"And you always said that, \u2018I\u2019m either I\u2019m telling my story or I\u2019m not. I have to I have to tell it all.\u2019\u201d",
      "Returning to Iran, Googoosh found herself harassed by its newly empowered theocracy, which put a lien on her home and blocked her ability to be issued a passport. Authorities banned her from performing or singing, she recounted, and at one point imprisoned her",
      "But she describes while trying to hide her identity in public or in private, people always pushed her to sing again, to find her voice despite the restrictions and threats.",

I did not want that life. I hoped I could somehow continue performing for my own people, inside my own country.\u201d",
      "Ultimately though, in 2000 under the government of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, Googoosh was able to get a contract to perform abroad, pull the money together to pay off her liens, obtain a passport and leave Iran. She never returned, but has performed abroad for the last 25 years for Iranians who similarly are homesick for their country.",
      "Islamic hard-liners within Iran still denounce her, particularly after 2014 music video about homosexual love, punishable by death in the country.",

The 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests that followed enraged women of all ages and views in a way few other issues have since the revolution.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to have that type of recognizable material played on the instrument,\u201d Samaroo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice space we are in right now.\u201d",
      "Pannists, as the players are known, boast about the steelpan being able to belt out any genre of music. Add the influence of whatever is trending, and you get an instrument that\u2019s growing its fanbase at a rapid pace.",

      "Designer Matthieu Blazy has taken Chanel's fashions underground, with a runway show on a New York City subway platform",
      "NEW YORK -- Chanel\u2019s new showman, Matthieu Blazy, took his designs on the road Tuesday \u2014 or rather, underground, with a buzzy New York runway show staged on an actual subway platform.",
      "The designer, just weeks after his splashy Paris debut for Chanel in October, took over a decommissioned part of Manhattan's Bowery station for his first M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection. The annual show, which takes place in a different city each year, celebrates the craftsmanship of the artisans that partner with Chanel.",
      "In this case, it was two shows \u2014 one in the afternoon and one in the evening. And befitting the first Chanel shows in New York since 2018, there were VIPs aplenty: A$AP Rocky, Tilda Swinton, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Kristen Stewart, Sofia Coppola, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jessie Buckley, Margaret Qualley, Bowen Yang, Jon Bon Jovi and many others.",
      "The location had been a closely held secret. Guests entered via a doorway at 168 Bowery, and at first, it seemed like Chanel had perhaps decorated an event space to resemble a subway station, complete with tiled walls, turnstiles and a newsstand (with its own bespoke newspapers).",
      "But down a flight of stairs was the real platform. Guests settled into bleacher seats resembling subway benches. \u201cStand clear of the closing doors!\u201d came the announcement on the soundtrack, familiar to New Yorkers. Then a train came rolling in, and out of the cars came the models.",
      "The show was a marked contrast in vibe with the last M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection in New York in 2018, when the late designer Karl Lagerfeld took over the Egyptian Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for what felt like a mini-Met Gala, with clothes channeling the luxury of Egyptian royalty.",
      "Blazy was inspired not by royalty but by ordinary urban commuters, of different ages and types, coming together in a mashup of styles from different eras, from the 1920s onward.",
      "\u201cThe New York subway belongs to all,\u201d the designer said in his show notes. \"Everyone uses it. There are students and game-changers, statesmen and teenagers. It is a place full of wonderful encounters, a clash of pop archetypes.\u201d",
      "His models strolled the platform, some checking for arriving trains \u2014 feigning annoyance at their lateness \u2014 or leaning against a post as they waited. Their numbers increased until, by the end, there was a virtual rush hour of fashion, with the eclectic soundtrack playing the \u201cHappy Days\u201d theme song as a finale.",

      "\u201cThis felt like breaking the system,\u201d said Stewart, speaking after the afternoon show. \u201cI genuinely had an emotional response to the show. I felt like I just saw so many different versions of a person walking. It wasn't one woman.\"",
      "Stewart, like others, had no idea going in what the show\u2019s theme would be, and thought the subway environment felt like \u201ca flurry of fleeting caught moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 I wanted to go with them,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI believed in it. All of this is artifice, but when you do a really good impression of the truth, you find your own. This felt real to me.\u201d",
      "It was real enough that Chanel had printed its own \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 called La Gazette \u2014 to accompany the show, with articles and interviews. An interview with Blazy quoted the designer as saying the collection was inspired partly by the 1931 visit to New York of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "And he sang the praises of the subway.",

      "If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood\u2019s year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear",
      "NEW YORK -- If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood's year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear: Paul Thomas Anderson's \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is the Oscar front-runner.",
      "On Monday, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film at the 35th Gotham Awards. On Tuesday, it was named best film by the New York Film Critics Circle. On Wednesday, it swept the National Board of Review Awards, winning best film, best director for Anderson and acting awards for Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and newcomer Chase Infiniti.",
      "Expect to hear this pun a lot: one award after another.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d Anderson said at the Gothams. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",
      "That may be the first, and last, time Anderson can say that this awards season.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of political resistance in the face of recurring oppression, has firmly established itself as the movie of the moment. With an opening scene depicting a raid at an immigrant detention facility, Anderson's opus has struck critics and moviegoers, alike, for its contemporary relevance in the first year of President Donald Trump's second term. Even foes of the film, like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, have predicted it will \u201cwin all the Academy Awards.\u201d",
      "Yet Anderson's film is, in many ways, an Academy Awards oddity. It's a critically acclaimed release that skipped film festivals. It's a big-budget studio movie that wasn't a hit. In fact, should \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d go on to win at the March 15 Oscars, it could be one of the only money-losers to ever win the industry's top honor.",
      "Smaller films have, increasingly, won best picture. That includes indies like \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2014 much-praised films with minuscule box office. Hollywood long ago got used to honoring films that exist largely outside its mainstream, franchise-obsessed business. And the notion of what constitutes a best-picture movie has grown elastic. \u201cParasite,\u201d\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and, the most recent winner, \u201cAnora,\u201d have all shaken traditional notions of Oscar material.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d represents something different. With a production budget of at least $130 million (some reports have it much higher) and another $70 million in marketing costs, it will have to have an extraordinary after-theater life to break even. Thus far, the Warner Bros. release has made $70.6 million domestically and $131.6 million overseas \u2014 great sums for an adult-oriented, R-rated, auteur-driven film that runs nearly three hours.",
      "Still, Variety earlier estimated \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will lose $100 million, a figure that Warner Bros. has disputed. It's too harsh a label, but such a discrepancy could make \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d tagged as the first best picture-winning flop.",
      "Awards season has a long way to go. None of the awards dished out this week has any direct correlation with academy voters. Some contenders, like A24's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d have yet to hit theaters. Others, like Focus Features' \u201cHamnet,\u201d are just arriving. Support is also strong for another Warner Bros. title, Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners,\u201d which might pose the stiffest competition for \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d Both films are returning to IMAX screens on Dec. 12.",
      "But a bottom line in the red is far from a unique cross to bear this fall. Aside from the blockbuster launches of \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d waves of would-be awards contenders \u2014 films like \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d \u201cRoofman\u201d and \u201cChristy\u201d\u2014 have fizzled with ticket buyers. It's been a grueling fall for a wide spectrum of contenders, a context that makes \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d comparatively, a smash success.",
      "The biggest financial ding against it, really, is that it cost a lot \u2014 arguably too much \u2014 to make. At a time when so few films anything like \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d get greenlit, let alone with such budgets, the cost of \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d could even be seen as a badge of honor. Here is a movie that win, lose or draw, is in the fight for a kind of moviemaking that's under siege. To quote DiCaprio's Bob Ferguson: \u201cViva la revolution!\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- RoboCop has finally found a permanent home in Detroit.",
      "A statue looming 11 feet tall (3.3 meters) and weighing 3,500 pounds (1,587 kilograms) has been drawing fans since it began standing guard over the Motor City on Wednesday afternoon, after about 15 years in the making. Even in a snowstorm in the dark, people were driving by to see it, said Jim Toscano, co-owner of the FREE AGE film production company where the bronze-cast statue now stands bolted near the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cRoboCop\u201d hit theaters in 1987, portraying a near-future Detroit as crime-ridden and poorly protected by a beleaguered and outgunned police force, until actor Peter Weller appeared as a nearly invincible cyborg, created by a nefarious corporation bent on privatizing policing.",
      "There was a time when Detroit pushed back on anything pointing to its past reputation as an unsafe city, and the movie, which developed a cult following, spawning two sequels and a reboot, didn't help its image.",
      "But things have changed. Violent crime has been trending down for years. Homicide numbers have dropped below mid-1960s levels. And city officials offered no objections to the statue's installation, Toscano said.",
      "\u201cI think there will be a lot more acceptance,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cDetroit has come a long way. You put in a little nostalgia and that helps.\u201d",
      "The statue campaign appears to have started around 2010 when Detroit Mayor Dave Bing was tagged in a tweet that noted Philadelphia's statue of boxer Rocky Balboa and said RoboCop would be a \u201cGREAT ambassador for Detroit.\u201d",
      "Bing tweeted back, saying there were no such plans. But some Detroiters ran with the idea, crowdfunding it through a 2012 Kickstarter campaig n that raised more than $67,000 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide, and Detroit sculptor Giorgio Gikas finished the statue in 2017.",
      "Then, it got stuck, stored away from public view.",
      "The Michigan Science Center in Detroit ultimately nixed plans to host the sculpture in 2021, citing pressures from the coronavirus pandemic and the need to focus museum resources. Officials in Stevens Point, Wisconsin raised their hands, hoping to honor Weller, a native son of that city, by erecting it outside the police station or in a park.",
      "The search for a suitable home for RoboCop remained in limbo until about three years ago when Toscano's company bought a building in Eastern Market, an open-air produce market, shopping and entertainment district just northeast of downtown. Toscano says he thought they were \u201ckidding\u201d when he was contacted by the creator of the statue idea and Eastern Market officials. But he and his business partner gladly came on board: \u201cIt's too unusual, too unique, too cool not to do,\u201d Toscano said.",

      "DALLAS -- From the election of Zohran Mamdani to the intrigue surrounding the jewel heist at the Louvre, keeping up with this year's news also left some Americans struggling with pronunciations. That's put both the name of New York City's incoming mayor and the famed Paris museum on a list of the most mispronounced words in 2025.",

When he takes office in January, the 34-year-old will become the city\u2019s first Muslim mayor, first born in Africa and first of South Asian heritage. Babbel said his name \u2014 which should be pronounced zoh-RAHN mam-DAH-nee \u2014 was most commonly mispronounced when people swapped the \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d in his last name.",

During one mayoral race debate, he chided former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's pronunciation of his name, telling his opponent: \"The name is Mamdani. M-A-M-D-A-N-I.\u201d",
      "The theft of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre in October had many people mispronouncing the name of the world\u2019s most-visited museum. Babbel says the correct pronunciation is LOOV-ruh, with a very soft pronunciation on the \u201cruh,\u201d which can be a challenge for English speakers.",
      "\u201cA lot of these words come from different languages and so we have to adapt to a sound that we\u2019ve never made before,\u201d said Esteban Touma, a linguistic and cultural expert at Babbel.",

By Sunday, in a quick pivot, the venue will assume its more traditional role as the host of the annual awards program honoring some of the top artists in the U.S.",
      "The culture headsnap has one thing in common: President Donald Trump's starring role.",
      "Trump was instrumental in working with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to move the draw to the Kennedy Center after it was widely expected to take place in Las Vegas. FIFA may further recognize Trump at the event with a newly created peace prize. Infantino hasn't confirmed that Trump will be the recipient but the two have forged a notably close relationship and Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize. On the same day last month that FIFA said it would issue the new award, Infantino called Trump a \u201cclose friend\" who has \u201csuch an incredible energy.\u201d",
      "If the prospect of a peace prize isn't enough attention, Trump will assume a role played in the past by the broadcasting legend Walter Cronkite and other luminaires by hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, if current plans hold. When Trump announced the honorees at the Kennedy Center in August, he cast himself as reluctantly taking on the duties at the request of his chief of staff.",
      "\u201cI've been asked to host,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, I\u2019m the President of the United States. Are you fools asking me to do that? Sir, you\u2019ll get much higher ratings. I said 'I don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "There are few recent parallels to the fervor that's about to descend on the Kennedy Center. When the U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, the draw was held in Las Vegas and Bill Clinton, the president at the time, didn't attend. When presidents participate in the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 Trump skipped the event during his first term \u2014 they generally stay in their box, wave to the audience and cheer the honorees.",
      "This week's lineup is a reminder that for Trump \u2014 a two-term president, bestselling author and onetime reality television star \u2014 his favorite role is that of a showman. And Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center from one of Washington's relatively apolitical spaces into something of an extension of his White House affords him a natural stage.",
      "The shift at the Kennedy Center began quickly after Trump's return to Washington in late January. Within a month, he ousted the institution\u2019s leadership, filled the board of trustees with his supporters and announced he had been elected the board\u2019s chair.",
      "Trump and his aides criticized the Kennedy Center's programming as \u201cwoke\" and accused the previous leadership of financial mismanagement and neglecting the building. Some renovations have been underway in recent weeks, including using white paint over columns that were previously gold.",
      "Deborah Rutter, who was fired as the Kennedy Center's president, said in a May statement that allegations of poor financial management were \u201cfalse\u201d and insisted that when she left, \u201cthe Kennedy Center was fiscally sound.\u201d",
      "But the fallout has been intense with prominent musicals such as \u201cHamilton\u201d canceling performances. Actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny also withdrew from appearances while consultants such as musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming resigned. Some artists have expressed a sense of sadness at the changes.",
      "\u201cIt was always a joy to be asked to perform at the Kennedy Center,\u201d Jane Alexander, an actor and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, told The Associated Press.",
      "For its part, the Kennedy Center's new leadership has said it is focusing on programming that appeals to a broad audience and doesn't lose money. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has emphasized \u201ccommon sense\u201d programming.",
      "But Democrats in Congress are scrutinizing whether the new management is ultimately costing the Kennedy Center money. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents last month showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",

      "The notion that the Kennedy Center would end up in a spat with Congress would have been unheard of just a few years ago.

      "When Las Vegas hosted the draw, Vanessa Williams and James Brown were headliners.

      "Tourism has taken a hit with travel research firm Tourism Economics predicting a 4.3% decline in international visits to Washington in 2025.

      "The Gothams, presented by the Gotham Film & Media Institute, aren\u2019t considered an Oscar bellwether.

      "Claire\u2019s grown kids (Felicity Jones, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Dominic Sessa ) don\u2019t appreciate her efforts. Her husband (Denis Leary) is supportive without being helpful. And she is operating as a one woman show, managing this precious time with her family and trying to keep it all cozy and happy and fun through constant, thankless labor (cooking, cleaning, wrapping, planning). She even looks fabulous on her many, many (too many?) garbage runs. But after one particularly cruel oversight from her family, she takes off from her suburban prison and doesn\u2019t tell anyone. For once, she\u2019s decided to go do something for herself.",

Fun\u201d is a movie that does very little with its setup and terrific cast (including the likes of Danielle Brooks, Joan Chen, Maude Apatow, Rose Abdoo and Eva Longoria in almost cameo-sized roles) opting instead for the most generic version of itself.",
      "The movie, streaming Wednesday on Prime Video, begins with a kind of \u201clow point\u201d (for a beautiful, well-off, stay-at-home Texas mom, that is) in which she tells some children in a neighboring car at a gas station to be nicer to their exhausted mother in the front seat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead someday,\u201d she says calmly and seriously. She wishes the mother a Merry Christmas, gives the kids a piercing look and then we get the dreaded freeze-frame/record scratch and a voiceover about being entitled to a little outburst around the holidays and a half-hearted rant about how many holiday movies are about men. Already this movie is making this poor woman apologize.",
      "\u201cThey need to make a movie about the true heroes of the holidays: Moms,\u201d Claire says.

      "Director Michael Showalter co-wrote the script with the short story\u2019s author, Chandler Baker and is committed to keeping the proceedings light and breezy (no cancer diagnoses here). But the effect is a movie that seems almost embarrassed to commit to its own silly premise, rushing through everything instead of letting us enjoy this cast. Everyone gets assigned one tidy problem or flaw and no one has any sort of lived-in familial chemistry with one another.",
      "Channing (Jones) is the oldest and is married to Doug (Jason Schwartzman) who really wants her younger sister Taylor (Moretz) to think he\u2019s cool although Taylor, a serial monogamist who always brings a new woman home for the holidays, is just mean to him.

      "For decades, the nation's vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.",
      "In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months.",
      "Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren't tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.",
      "A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its analysis of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.",

      "The committee tabled a vote at the September meeting, but it's slated to be acted on during Thursday's meeting, according to the agenda. Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.",
      "Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.",
      "This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released a report estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report \u2014 which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal \u2014 estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.",

One seller is Amazon. Another is Alibaba, a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The easy availability of the drugs combined with their hard-to-detect nature is precisely the toxic combination doping regulators and Olympic officials are trying to avoid.

      "Though online pharmaceuticals and supplements have for years been portrayed as a risk by anti-doping authorities, the influx of certain hard-to-detect peptides \u2014 chains of protein-building amino acids marketeed to help with anything from anti-aging to workout recovery to weight and memory loss \u2014 presents a more difficult challenge.",

      "Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years.",
      "The hearing, which started Monday and could extend to next week, applies only to the state case. But it is giving the public an extensive preview of some testimony, video, 911 audio and other records relevant to both cases.",
      "It's not immediately clear what witnesses or evidence are expected Thursday.",
      "Tuesday's court session displayed police body-camera video of officers confronting Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and concluding \u2014 to their amazement \u2014 that he was the much-publicized suspect in Thompson's killing five days earlier.",
      "They interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he\u2019d been in New York recently and other questions, including: \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d",

      "Mangione's lawyers argue that his statements shouldn't be allowed as trial evidence because officers started questioning him before reading his rights. The defense contends the backpack items should be excluded because police didn\u2019t get a warrant before searching his bag.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet detailed their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Federal prosecutors have maintained that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there was nothing dangerous inside and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.",

      "In one of the world's most volatile nations, Somalis must be aware of their responsibility to their country and each other, he said in a recital emphasizing good citizenship.",
      "The 70-year-old Barre cut a somber figure at the podium. His message echoed in the largely empty hall of the National Theater in Mogadishu, the capital, where aging poets in austere suits gather to share verses and recall the good old days.",
      "The men, some with hennaed beards and glaucoma eyes, represent a fading measure of hope for a country that has been slowly stripped of its cultural wealth during decades of conflict.",
      "There may be no higher art in Somalia than oral poetry, which is recited in the most remote outposts and even by militants in the bush.

      "Poets flourished during the reign of Siad Barre, who ruled Somalia with an iron hand but was known to respect the intellectual work of artists. His removal in 1991 by clan-based militias provoked a civil war as warlords fought for authority \u2014 chaos that eventually led to the deadly rise of the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia is now known far more for bombings than poetry. The violence has not spared its cultural institutions, now mostly in limbo as the fragile federal government spends the bulk of its budget on national security.",
      "The National Theater, like the National Museum next door, is largely inactive. To reach the venue in a heavily guarded area near the presidential palace, visitors traveling in a vehicle must notify the intelligence agency in advance, part of security precautions that demand not just the car\u2019s license plate number but even its make and color.",

      "The turnout rate reached 31.9%, surpassing the 30.2% in the 2021 election, the first held under the new system. It was much lower than before the electoral changes, when turnout topped 50%.",
      "Many of the city\u2019s 4.1 million eligible voters, especially democracy supporters, have turned away from politics since a crackdown that has stifled dissent.

Most spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.",

      "The countries' ties plunged recently over the Japanese leader\u2019s Taiwan remarks.",
      "TOKYO -- Japan said early Sunday that it has protested to China after a military jet that took off from the Chinese carrier Liaoning locked its radar on Japanese fighter jets near the southern island of Okinawa, the latest spat between the two countries whose ties have plunged recently over the Japanese leader\u2019s Taiwan remarks.",
      "Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry said China\u2019s military aircraft J-15 \u201cintermittently\u201d targeted its radar at Japanese F-15 fighter jets on two occasions Saturday \u2014 for about three minutes in the late afternoon and for about 30 minutes in the evening.",
      "The radar lock by the Chinese aircraft was detected by different Japanese fighters that had scrambled against a possible airspace violation by China, according to the ministry. There was no breach of Japanese airspace, and no injury or damage was reported from the incident.",
      "It was not known whether the radar lock incident involved the same Chinese J-15 both times.",
      "Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, briefing reporters in the early hours of Sunday, said Japan protested to China over the radar lock, calling it \u201ca dangerous act that exceeded the scope necessary for safe aircraft operations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe occurrence of such an incident is extremely regrettable,\u201d Koizumi said. \u201cWe have lodged a strong protest with the Chinese side and demanded strict preventive measures.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Chinese government or military. On Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said the Chinese navy operates in accordance with international law and that others shouldn't hype up its activities.",
      "The latest incident comes as relations between the two countries have worsened in recent weeks.",
      "China was angered by a statement by Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in early November that its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing says must come under its rule.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s economy contracted at an annual pace of 2.3% in the July-September period, the government reported Monday, as exports suffered from the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and public investments slipped.",
      "The decline in Japan\u2019s gross domestic product, or the sum value of its goods and services, translates to a 0.6% on-quarter fall, and marked a lowered revision from the preliminary data released last month, which had shown a drop of 1.8% at an annual rate, or 0.4% on-quarter, according to the Cabinet Office.",
      "The annualized rate shows what the economy would have done if the same rate were to continue for a year.",
      "Exports dropped 1.2% in the quarter compared to the previous quarter, unchanged from the preliminary figure, while private residential investment fell 8.2%, slightly less than the 9.4% fall seen in the earlier data.",
      "Trump implemented higher tariffs on imports from many countries earlier this year.",
      "In September, the U.S. lowered the tariffs surcharge on nearly all Japanese imports to 15% from an earlier plan for a 25% tariff. The tariffs on autos are a serious blow to Japan\u2019s economy. Japan has promised to invest $550 billion in the United States, in an accommodating move announced during the tariff negotiations.",
      "Analysts say the drop in private residential investment observed in the July-September quarter was mainly due to revisions of Japan\u2019s building code that caused housing starts to plunge from earlier this year.",

To some, it smacked of the Italian-led Secretariat of State taking advantage of a sick pope to announce a new flow of unchecked donations into its coffers after Francis took its 600 million-euro ($684 million) sovereign wealth fund away and gave it to another office to manage as punishment for the London fiasco.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration will start sending more water to California farmers in the state's crop-rich Central Valley",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration is making good on a promise to send more water to California farmers in the state\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Thursday announced a new plan for operating the Central Valley Project, a vast system of pumps, dams and canals that direct water southward from the state\u2019s wetter north. It follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed in January calling for more water to flow to farmers, arguing the state was wasting the precious resource in the name of protecting endangered fish species.",
      "Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the plan will help the federal government \u201cstrengthen California\u2019s water resilience.\" It takes effect Friday.",
      "But California officials and environmental groups blasted the move, saying sending significantly more water to farmlands could threaten water delivery to the rest of the state and would harm salmon and other fish.",
      "Most of the state\u2019s water is in the north, but most of its people are in the south. The federally-managed Central Valley Project works in tandem with the state-managed State Water Project, which sends water to cities that supply 27 million Californians. The systems transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuary that provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife including salmon and the delta smelt.",
      "It is important for the two systems to work together, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement. She warned the Trump administration\u2019s plan could limit the state's ability to send water to cities and farmers. That is because the state could be required to devote more water to species protection if the federal project sends more to farms.",
      "Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director at Restore the Delta, said pumping more water out would result in more Delta smelt and juvenile salmon dying from getting stuck in the pumping system, and once the temperature warms, harmful algae blooms will develop that are dangerous to fish, wildlife, pets and people. That could have economic impacts, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you destroy water quality and divorce it from land, you are also destroying property values,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to live near a fetid, polluted backwater swamp.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation denied the changes would harm the environment or endangered species.",
      "The Central Valley Project primarily sends water to farms, with a much smaller amount going to cities and industrial use. Water from the Central Valley Project irrigates roughly one-third of California agriculture, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "The Westlands Water District, one of the largest uses of Central Valley Project water, cheered the decision. It \u201cwill help ensure that our growers have the water they need to support local communities and the nation\u2019s food supply, while also protecting California\u2019s wildlife,\u201d general manager Allison Febbo said in a statement.",

      "During Trump's first term, he allowed more water to be directed to the Central Valley, a move that Newsom fought in court, saying it would push endangered delta smelt, chinook salmon and steelhead trout populations to extinction.

      "The government picked a company with little experience working with the Federal Aviation Administration called Peraton to oversee the roughly $31.5 billion overhaul of the outdated air traffic control system.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday evening that Peraton was chosen in the hope that its innovative approach will make it possible to complete the upgrades within the next three years before the end of President Donald Trump's term in office ends. Peraton was chosen over Parsons Corp., which does have extensive experience with FAA contracts.",
      "\u201cWorking together, we are going to build on the incredible progress we\u2019ve already made and deliver a state-of-the-art air traffic control system that the American traveling public \u2014 and our hard-working air traffic controllers \u2014 deserve,\u201d Duffy said in the announcement.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the modernization project and the company hired to oversee it:",
      "Earlier this year, Congress approved $12.5 billion as a down payment on the project after technical problems twice knocked out the radar for air traffic controllers managing planes around Newark Liberty International Airport. This year began with the worst American aviation disaster in years when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington D.C., killing 67 people.",
      "Duffy has said he'll need roughly $20 billion more to complete the upgrade.",
      "This effort to upgrade the technology controllers use is on a much more aggressive timeline than the previous NextGen effort that began shortly after the turn of the century and failed to deliver all the benefits it promised even after an investment of $36 billion. The Biden administration had estimated that upgrading the system might take more than a decade.",
      "The FAA hasn't yet released the details of how much Peraton will be paid for this contract, but the agency said it includes incentives to reward good performance and penalties for shortcomings.",
      "The technical problems that disrupted flights at the Newark airport in the spring demonstrated just how fragile the nation's aging air traffic control system is. And Duffy has said those kind of technical failures in a system that too often still relies on copper wires and floppy discs could happen anywhere unless the system is upgraded.",
      "Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed in Newark. After the radar outages, the facility in Philadelphia that controls the flights in and out of Newark had a half dozen controllers go on leave, which forced the reductions in flights.",
      "The number of flights across the country each day that the FAA has to safely manage is expected to continue growing in the years ahead. And drones will continue to proliferate across the country as flying taxis start to take to the air.",
      "Everyone agrees that the air traffic control system must be modernized to be able to handle those future demands.",
      "John Rose, chief risk adviser for global travel management company ALTOUR, said the three-year timeline is \u201cextremely aggressive\u201d but partially realistic. He said it\u2019s plausible for the FAA to build the foundation for a modern air traffic control network in its tight timeline, with more advanced capabilities layered on later.",
      "\u201cYou need to build the base before you can have all the bells and whistles,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the project gets to the core structure in three years, I think we\u2019ve accomplished the mission.\u201d",
      "He likened it to an iPhone where once you have a robust base system you can upgrade the software like when the phone gets an iOS update. \u201cIf they build the infrastructure, then as things change from a technology capability, it\u2019s almost like a plug and play,\u201d he said.",
      "Air Traffic Control Association President and CEO Stephen Creamer represents the companies that make the gear that Peraton and the FAA will use to complete the upgrades. He said it helps that the new system won't have to be built from scratch.",

      "And significant work remains ahead to install more than 27,600 new radios and 612 new radar systems. The old connections still need to upgraded at thousands of additional facilities, and six new air traffic control centers are scheduled to be built.",

      "Somalia's international airport was filled with anticipation on a recent morning as 165 migrants were repatriated from Libya",
      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Somali migrant Mohamed Abdi Awale endured horrors on an ill-fated journey across Africa to seek a better life in the West \u2014 but he's determined to try again one day, even aiming for the U.S. despite increasing restrictions.",
      "Awale is one of 165 Somali migrants recently repatriated after being detained in Libya, where the International Organization for Migration says those caught on journeys to Europe face \u201cunacceptable and inhumane conditions.\u201d",
      "Awale undertook a more than 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) journey, leaving Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, to cross Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan.",
      "He was captured by smugglers near the Sudan-Libyan border and taken to the Sahara oasis town of Kufra, where captors filmed him being tortured in a bid to extract a ransom from his family.",
      "\u201cTorture became normal,\u201d Awale said. \u201cIf you failed to pay, they beat you until you fainted. Some people lost their minds. Others didn\u2019t survive.\u201d",
      "Unable to afford the ransom, his mother, Hawo Elmo Rage, turned to social media, pleading with Somalis at home and abroad to help her save her son.",
      "\u201cThey told me to send the money or they would take his life,\u201d Rage said. She ultimately raised $17,000, enough to free him.",
      "Awale was released from Kufra and put in a car bound for the Mediterranean coast with other migrants. After their vehicle broke down, the group trekked for more than two weeks, facing starvation and dehydration.",
      "\u201cI thought we would die there,\u201d Awale said.",
      "The group was then detained outside of Tripoli, and Awale spent a month in prison in the coastal town of Sirte and another two months in detention in Tripoli before his repatriation to Somalia in November.",
      "Awale became one of hundreds of thousands of Somalis that have fled the country in more than three decades of civil war, according to UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency, which estimates that another 3.5 million people are displaced within Somalia itself.",

      "\u201cI want him to stay,\u201d his mother said. \u201cBut I know he wishes for a better life. I pray God gives him a safe future\u2014 not the dangerous one he found.\u201d",
      "Changes to immigration policy this year under Trump administration changed the calculus of migrants like Awale. U.S. President Donald Trump banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of Somalia and 11 other countries in June \u2014 so Awale set his sights on Europe.",
      "Awale remains hopeful that he will reach the U.S. one day, despite anti-Somali sentiment from the White House and a further tightening of immigration restrictions for Somalis.",
      "The White House also announced this week that it was pausing all immigration applications for people from 19 countries, including Somalia.",
      "\u201cMy dream was America, but I felt like Trump closed that door,\u201d Awale said. \u201cMaybe after Trump\u2019s term ends.\u201d",

      "Federal border agents have descended on a Hispanic enclave just outside New Orleans and local business owners are suffering",
      "KENNER, La. -- The doors of Carmela Diaz's taco joint are locked, the tables are devoid of customers and no one is working in the kitchen. It's one of many once-thriving Hispanic businesses, from Nicaraguan eateries to Honduran restaurants, emptied out in recent weeks in neighborhoods with lots of signs in Spanish but increasingly fewer people on the streets.",
      "In the city of Kenner, which has the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in Louisiana, a federal immigration crackdown aiming for 5,000 arrests has devastated an economy already struggling from ramped-up enforcement efforts this year, some business owners say, and had far-reaching impacts on both immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.",
      "\u201cFewer and fewer people came,\u201d said a crying Diaz, whose Taqueria La Conquistadora has been closed for several weeks now with both customers and workers afraid to leave home. \u201cThere were days we didn\u2019t sell anything. That\u2019s why I made the decision to close the business \u2014 because there was no business.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, convoys of federal vehicles began rumbling back and forth down Kenner's main commercial streets as the Department of Homeland Security commenced the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations that have included surges in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Bystanders have posted videos of federal agents detaining people outside Kenner businesses and at construction sites.",
      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino also made an appearance in the city, surrounded by agents in tactical gear, to tout to reporters the launch of the operation dubbed Catahoula Crunch, a name derived from the big game hound that is the Louisiana state dog.",
      "The state's Hispanic population has boomed in the last two decades, with many of them arriving in the aftermath of 2005's Hurricane Katrina to help rebuild. In Kenner, just west of New Orleans between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, Hispanics make up about 30% of residents.",
      "Diaz, who is from El Salvador, arrived in 2006 after years of doing farm work in Texas. She opened food trucks, earning enough to buy a home in Kenner, and her business has since expanded to a fleet of trucks and two brick-and-mortar restaurants.",
      "Nearly all that is shuttered at the moment due to the crackdown, and Diaz is scraping by through making home deliveries to people fearful of being swept up by agents.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t respect anyone,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cThey don\u2019t ask for documents. They don\u2019t investigate. They slap the handcuffs on them and take them away.\u201d",
      "Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday that federal agents have already made dozens of arrests, though the agency has not released a full list of people detained.",
      "\u201cAmericans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens harming them, their families, or their neighbors,\u201d McLaughlin said in a statement. \u201cIn just 24 hours on the ground, our law enforcement officers have arrested violent criminals with rap sheets that include homicide, kidnapping, child abuse, robbery, theft, and assault.\u201d",

      "Sergio Perez, a Guatemalan immigrant and U.S. citizen who has lived in Kenner since 2010, said he has loved ones there who lack legal permission to be in the country risk and being detained or deported. He also worries that anyone who is Hispanic is at risk of abuse by federal agents, regardless of their immigration status.",

      "As Hong Kong mourns after a high-rise fire killed at least 151 people, anger is mounting over building safety lapses and government oversight",
      "HONG KONG -- Uncomfortable questions are being raised over who is to blame for Hong Kong\u2019s deadliest blaze in decades.",
      "As the territory mourns over the high-rise apartment fire that killed at least 151 people, anger and frustration are mounting over building safety lapses, suspected construction corruption and lax government oversight.",
      "But bigger issues are at play. Some political analysts and observers say the tragedy could be the \u201ctip of an iceberg\u201d in Hong Kong, a city whose skyline is built on high-rise buildings. Suspicions of bid-rigging and use of hazardous construction materials in renovation projects across other housing estates have left many worried the disaster could be repeated.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body have arrested 14 people so far in a wide-ranging probe into a multi-million dollar renovation project at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex, where the fire broke out on Wednesday. Those detained include scaffolding subcontractors, directors of a construction company and a consultancy, many of them on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence.",
      "\u201cThe question (one) should be asking, really is that, what happened at Wang Fuk Court, can it happen elsewhere?\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.",
      "Hong Kong officials initially said tests of green netting covering bamboo scaffolding at the housing complex in suburban Tai Po showed that it met fire safety codes, but highly flammable foam panels used to seal windows during the repairs, aided by strong winds, caused the blaze to spread swiftly between seven of the eight towers in the complex.",
      "But on Monday, Eric Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, said that seven of 20 additional samples collected later from the site failed to meet safety standards. Authorities said there was evidence contractors cut costs by using cheaper substandard netting along with standard materials to pad their profits, after a typhoon in July damaged some of the netting originally installed.",
      "Some fire alarms failed to sound when the fire broke out, residents and officials said.",
      "\u201cIt did open a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got all of these issues which have been swept under the table,\u201d said HKU\u2019s Burns. \u201cBecause of all that we now know -- or believe we know -- about bid-rigging, collusion, corruption, no fire alarms, government negligence, all of these things have come out.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.",
      "The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans\u2019 access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.",
      "The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"From day one I\u2019ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.\u201d Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.",
      "The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was \u201ca win for customers and common sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs America\u2019s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump\u2019s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,\u201d he said.",
      "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration\u2019s actions to \u201crealign\u201d the mileage standards \u201cwith real world market conditions.\u201d",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.",
      "Environmentalists decried the rollback.",
      "\u201cIn one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation\u2019s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "\u201cGutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine Garc\u00eda, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program. \u201cThis rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV \u201cmandate,\u201d referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.",
      "The new rules \u201care going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,\u201d Duffy said Wednesday.",
      "Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.",
      "The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration\u2019s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds going into the air in coming years.",
      "Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles\u2019 average efficiency.",
      "\u201cWeakening fuel economy standards won\u2019t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,'' said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.",

      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into events like weddings and birthdays, some are growing their own bouquets or picking wildflowers straight from local fields",
      "Instead of hiring a florist for her October wedding, Emily Day decided to grow her own flowers in her front yard in Calgary, Canada \u2014 a creative challenge that turned into a lesson on the hidden climate costs of the global flower industry. She said her homegrown arrangements were just as beautiful as store-bought ones and cost a fraction of the price.",
      "Day and her fiance built garden boxes out of wooden shipping containers in March and filled them with blooms like yarrow, feverfew, strawflowers and statice. They harvested and dried them in midsummer ahead of fall frosts. On her wedding day, her bouquets featured autumn shades accented by blue echinops from a local farmer and tansy she foraged from roadside ditches.",
      "Because her flowers were dried, they\u2019ll last far longer than a typical wedding arrangement. In total, she spent about 1,300 Canadian dollars ($925), a fraction of what many couples pay florists. Day said growing her own flowers made her think more about the environmental costs behind imported blooms \u2014 from the plastic packaging they arrive in, to the fuel used to fly them across continents.",
      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into weddings and other special events, some are growing their own bouquets, picking wildflowers or using potted plants. Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event\u2019s done.",
      "The path many imported fresh flowers take to North America often begins in South America and involves a supply chain full of carbon emissions, said Kai Chan, professor of sustainability science at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Flowers perish quickly when they are cut, so they are refrigerated and transported on planes, both of which require energy and release planet-warming gases. Growing massive fields of roses, or any other single plant, typically requires clearing trees and other natural vegetation. This practice, known as monoculture, harms the environment by depleting soil nutrients and making the area more vulnerable to pests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of antithetical to the way that ecosystems work \u2026 you\u2019re fighting against nature at every turn,\u201d Chan said.",

      "Holly Lukasiewicz, who owns District 2 Florals in Omaha, Nebraska, incorporates sustainable practices such as sourcing locally and avoiding the green foam blocks that are used to anchor arrangements but typically aren't biodegradable. For an extra fee, she\u2019ll pick up the flowers and compost them. She also presses and preserves flowers for clients.",
      "\u201cWhen I started my business, I knew that I wanted to recycle everything that I could, compost what I could, repurpose what I could,\u201d Lukasiewicz said.",
      "Lukasiewicz hopes more clients will embrace seasonal and local selections rather than expecting any flower, any time of the year.",

      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application. But schools say AI tools can help admissions offices eliminate errors in tasks like uploading transcripts and can simplify the process for students.",
      "Georgia Tech this fall is rolling out an AI tool to review the college transcripts of transfer students, replacing the need for staff to enter each course manually into a database. It will allow the school to inform applicants more quickly how many transfer credits they'll receive, cutting down on uncertainty and wait times, said Richard Clark, the school's executive director of enrollment management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more layer of delay and stress and inevitable errors. AI is going to kill that, which I\u2019m so excited about,\u201d Clark said. The school hopes to expand the service soon to all high school transcripts.

      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",

      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "While the committee will likely be reluctant to penalize a team that played an extra game \u2014 while surefire SEC playoff teams such as Texas A&M, Ole Miss and Oklahoma all watched from the comfort of home \u2014 the Tide's showing was so putrid over the first three quarters that it figures to be a restless night for coach Kalen DeBoer and his players.",
      "Not that DeBoer was willing to concede the point.",
      "He made it clear he considers the Tide (10-3, No. 9 CFP) a playoff team, no matter the outcome against Georgia (12-1, No. 3 CFP).",
      "\u201cIf this game applies to and takes away from our resume, I don't think that's right. I really don't,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cThe precedent has been set. I don't know how you can go into a conference playoff game as the No. 1 seed, where you've done all these things throughout the year and playing in this game \u2014 against one of the top teams in the country, as well \u2014 can hurt you and keep you out of the playoff.\"",
      "With Jam Miller sidelined by a lower leg injury, Alabama couldn't muster any semblance of a running game against a Georgia team it defeated 24-21 in Athens during the regular season. The Tide finished with minus-3 rushing yards and held the ball for just 23 minutes.",
      "Trailing 21-0 and having barely cleared 100 yards of total offense, the Tide finally showed signs of life in the final period with a nine-play, 91-yard drive for their lone touchdown. But Ty Simpson's short throw that Germie Bernard turned into a 23-yard score was the only glimmer on a dark day in Atlanta.",
      "When Alabama got the ball back deep in its own territory, DeBoer left the offense on the field for a fourth-and-2 play from the 12 \u2014 even with more than eight minutes still to play and all three of his timeouts.",
      "Fittingly, Simpson's sideline pass sailed far over the head of his intended receiver, and Georgia quickly finished off the victory with Zachariah Branch's 13-yard catch-and-run for a TD.",
      "\u201cWe know we're the best offense in the country,\u201d said Simpson, who completed 19 of 39 passes for 212 yards with an interception. \u201cWhen we don't show it, it's frustrating.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf we're really worried about the score, we probably would've punted,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cBut we're here to win an SEC championship.

      "Most notably, Alabama can boast that it was the first school in SEC history to win four straight games over ranked teams without benefit of a bye week, reeling off victories over Georgia, Vanderbilt, Missouri and Tennessee in a stretch that seemed likely to ensure a CFP berth.",
      "But the Tide also have the worst loss among the bubble teams, a 31-17 defeat by Florida State in the season opener \u2014 a result from more than three months ago that could come back to haunt Alabama in December. The Seminoles won just four more games to finish 5-7.",

      "Consider it a product of this most unlikely of pairings to determine the ACC title \u2014 Duke won 27-20 in overtime for its first outright league crown since 1962 \u2014 and the league\u2019s uncertain standing for bids to the 12-team CFP. And that meant Saturday's game attracted its share of curious onlookers, eager to see witness how it all might work out and how it might impact their favorite team.",
      "A validating two bids for the ACC? Just one? A \u201cdoomsday\u201d scenario of getting shut out of the playoff entirely? They were all seemingly in play. The only certainty was a Virginia win would secure a CFP bid for a team that was picked to finish 14th in the league in the preseason, leaving Miami to wait.",
      "And now, after the five-loss Blue Devils claimed the first overtime championship game in ACC history, everyone must wait for Sunday's unveiling of the bracket to find out whether a Power Four champion really could miss the CFP in favor of a second Group of Five winner in JMU.",

    "summary": "Police in Edmonton, Canada, have started a pilot project using AI-equipped body cameras to detect faces on a &quot;high risk&quot; watch list",
    "story": [
      "Police in Edmonton, Canada, have started a pilot project using AI-equipped body cameras to detect faces on a \"high risk\" watch list",
      "Police body cameras equipped with artificial intelligence have been trained to detect the faces of about 7,000 people on a \u201chigh risk\u201d watch list in the Canadian city of Edmonton, a live test of whether facial recognition technology shunned as too intrusive could have a place in policing throughout North America.",
      "But six years after leading body camera maker Axon Enterprise, Inc. said police use of facial recognition technology posed serious ethical concerns, the pilot project \u2014 switched on last week\u2014 is raising alarms far beyond Edmonton, the continent\u2019s northernmost city of more than 1 million people.",
      "A former chair of Axon\u2019s AI ethics board, which led the company to temporarily abandon facial recognition in 2019, told The Associated Press he\u2019s concerned that the Arizona-based company is moving forward without enough public debate, testing and expert vetting about the societal risks and privacy implications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essential not to use these technologies, which have very real costs and risks, unless there\u2019s some clear indication of the benefits,\u201d said the former board chair, Barry Friedman, now a law professor at New York University.",
      "Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith contends that the Edmonton pilot is not a product launch but \u201cearly-stage field research\u201d that will assess how the technology performs and reveal the safeguards needed to use it responsibly.",
      "\u201cBy testing in real-world conditions outside the U.S., we can gather independent insights, strengthen oversight frameworks, and apply those learnings to future evaluations, including within the United States,\u201d Smith wrote in a blog post.",
      "The pilot is meant to help make Edmonton patrol officers safer by enabling their body-worn cameras to detect anyone who authorities classified as having a \u201cflag or caution\u201d for categories such as \u201cviolent or assaultive; armed and dangerous; weapons; escape risk; and high-risk offender,\u201d said Kurt Martin, acting superintendent of the Edmonton Police Service. So far, that watch list has 6,341 people on it, Martin said at a Dec. 2 press conference. A separate watch list adds 724 people who have at least one serious criminal warrant, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to make sure that it\u2019s targeted so that these are folks with serious offenses,\" said Ann-Li Cooke, Axon\u2019s director of responsible AI.",
      "If the pilot expands, it could have a major effect on policing around the world. Axon, a publicly traded firm best known for developing the Taser, is the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras and has increasingly pitched them to police agencies in Canada and elsewhere. Axon last year beat its closest competitor, Chicago-based Motorola Solutions, in a bid to sell body cameras to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.",
      "Motorola said in a statement that it also has the ability to integrate facial recognition technology into police body cameras but, based on its ethical principles, has \u201cintentionally abstained from deploying this feature for proactive identification.\" It didn't rule out using it in the future.",
      "The government of Alberta in 2023 mandated body cameras for all police agencies in the province, including its capital city Edmonton, describing it as a transparency measure to document police interactions, collect better evidence and reduce timelines for resolving investigations and complaints.",
      "While many communities in the U.S. have also welcomed body cameras as an accountability tool, the prospect of real-time facial recognition identifying people in public places has been unpopular across the political spectrum. Backlash from civil liberties advocates and a broader conversation about racial injustice helped push Axon and Big Tech companies to pause facial recognition software sales to police.",
      "Among the biggest concerns were studies showing that the technology was flawed, demonstrating biased results by race, gender and age. It also didn't match faces as accurately on real-time video feeds as it did on faces posing for identification cards or police mug shots.",
      "Several U.S. states and dozens of cities have sought to curtail police use of facial recognition, though President Donald Trump's administration is now trying to block or discourage states from regulating AI.",
      "The European Union banned real-time public face-scanning police technology across the 27-nation bloc, except when used for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism.",
      "But in the United Kingdom, no longer part of the EU, authorities started testing the technology on London streets a decade ago and have used it to make 1,300 arrests in the past two years. The government is considering expanding its use across the country.",
      "Many details about Edmonton's pilot haven't been publicly disclosed. Axon doesn't make its own AI model for recognizing faces but declined to say which third-party vendor it uses.",

      "Martin said about 50 officers piloting the technology won't know if the facial recognition software made a match. The outputs will be analyzed later at the station. In the future, however, it could help police detect if there's a potentially dangerous person nearby so they can call in for assistance, Martin said.",
      "That's only supposed to happen if officers have started an investigation or are responding to a call, not simply while strolling through a crowd. Martin said officers responding to a call can switch their cameras from a passive to an active recording mode with higher-resolution imaging.",

      "The office of Alberta\u2019s information and privacy commissioner Diane McLeod said she received a privacy impact assessment from Edmonton police on Dec. 2, the same day Axon and police officials announced the program.

      "University of Alberta criminology professor Temitope Oriola said he's not surprised that the city is experimenting with live facial recognition, given that the technology is already ubiquitous in airport security and other environments.",
      "\u201cEdmonton is a laboratory for this tool,\u201d Oriola said. \u201cIt may well turn out to be an improvement, but we do not know that for sure.\u201d",
      "Oriola said the police service has had a sometimes \u201cfrosty\u201d relationship with its Indigenous and Black residents, particularly after the fatal police shooting of a member of the South Sudanese community last year, and it remains to be seen whether facial recognition technology makes policing safer or improves interactions with the public.",
      "Axon has faced blowback for its technology deployments in the past, as in 2022, when Friedman and seven other members of Axon's AI ethics board resigned in protest over concerns about a Taser-equipped drone.",
      "In the years since Axon opted against facial recognition, Smith, the CEO, says the company has \u201ccontinued controlled, lab-based research\u201d of a technology that has \u201cbecome significantly more accurate\u201d and is now ready for trial in the real world.",
      "But Axon acknowledged in a statement to the AP that all facial recognition systems are affected by \"factors like distance, lighting and angle, which can disproportionately impact accuracy for darker-skinned individuals.\u201d",
      "Every match requires human review, Axon said, and part of its testing is also \u201clearning what training and oversight human reviewers must have to mitigate known risks.\u201d",
      "Friedman said Axon should disclose those evaluations. He'd want to see more evidence that facial recognition has improved since his board concluded that it wasn't reliable enough to ethically justify its use in police cameras.",
      "Friedman said he's also concerned about police agencies greenlighting the technology's use without deliberation by local legislators and rigorous scientific testing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a decision to be made simply by police agencies and certainly not by vendors,\" he said. \u201cA pilot is a great idea. But there\u2019s supposed to be transparency, accountability. ... None of that\u2019s here. They\u2019re just going ahead. They found an agency willing to go ahead and they\u2019re just going ahead.\u201d",

      "European Union regulators have fined Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform X 120 million euros for failing to comply with digital regulations",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators on Friday fined Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform X 120 million euros ($140 million) for breaches of the bloc\u2019s digital regulations that they said could leave users exposed to scams and manipulation.",
      "The European Commission issued its decision following an investigation it opened two years ago into X under the 27-nation bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act, also known as the DSA.",
      "It's the first time that the EU has issued a so-called non-compliance decision since rolling out the DSA. The sweeping rulebook requires platforms to take more responsibility for protecting European users and cleaning up harmful or illegal content and products on their sites, under threat of hefty fines.",
      "The Commission said it was punishing X, previously known as Twitter, because of three different breaches of the DSA\u2019s transparency requirements. The decision could rile President Donald Trump, whose administration has lashed out at digital regulations, complaining that Brussels was targeting U.S. tech companies and vowing to retaliate.",
      "The company did not respond immediately to an email request for comment.",
      "EU regulators had already outlined their accusations in mid-2024 when they released preliminary findings of their investigation into X.",
      "Regulators said X\u2019s blue checkmarks broke the rules because on \u201cdeceptive design practices\u201d and could expose users to scams and manipulation.",
      "Before Musk acquired X, when it was previously known as Twitter, the checkmarks mirrored verification badges common on social media and were largely reserved for celebrities, politicians and other influential accounts.",

      "X also fell short of the transparency requirements for its ad database, regulators said.",
      "Platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience, to help researches detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns. But X's database, the Commission said, is undermined by design features and access barriers such as \"excessive delays in processing.\u201d",
      "Regulators also said X also puts up \u201cunnecessary barriers\u201d for researchers trying to access public data, which stymies research into systemic risks that European users face.",
      "\u201cDeceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU. The DSA protects users,\" Henna Virkkunen, the EU's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a prepared statement.",

His first big hit was an AI-generated song called \u201cBBL Drizzy\u201d that made fun of rapper Drake during the height of his feud with Kendrick Lamar.

      "The prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invited Lajoie and Willonius to exhibit their video creations this fall at a new AI gallery space in Manhattan, part of a promotion of AI creativity tool startups that the firm invests in.",
      "Willonius obliged. Lajoie ended up bowing out, after an interview with The Associated Press in which he voiced doubts about what he described as AI's \u201cNapster phase.\u201d The music-sharing website shuttered in the early 2000s after the record industry and rock band Metallica sued over copyright violations.",
      "The investment firm's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, has been bullish about AI's potential to bring new life into filmmaking and comedy. On a November podcast, he blamed Hollywood opposition to its adoption on \u201cwoke activists (who) have picked up AI as the new thing they\u2019re going to agitate about.\u201d He compared it to resistance to computer graphics in movies before they became commonplace.",
      "Lajoie said he shared his early AI video experiments with a few friends who are \u201canti-AI; real, real, anti-AI\u201d and they were surprised by how well the sketches retained Lajoie's own comedic voice.",
      "He insists he's no AI expert, just \u201ca creative person who can figure out how to make two characters talk to each other.\u201d But even editing the sketches requires understanding comedic timing, and he has no interest in ceding that part to a machine.",
      "\u201cThe thing with comedy is it\u2019s so related to performance, delivery and point of view,\u201d Lajoie said. \u201cDo AIs have a point of view? They can grab a few points of view from different people.\u201d",

      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "A species can be banned for trade in its home range but sold online by traders who abuse the CITES permitting process and captive breeding rules and then take advantage of importing countries that don't bother to check if the animals come from the wild, Collis said.",
      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",
      "The CITES proposals draw attention to a long-running problem with captive breeding of exotic species, according to Lieberman of the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "Sony also picked its market carefully, Caulfield says. With Sega and Nintendo largely targeting children, Sony aimed the PlayStation at teens and young adults \u2014 catnip for their younger brothers and sisters.",
      "\u201cIf you grew up loving Nintendo games, the PlayStation was like a really good next step,\u201d says Tyler Treese, the editor-in-chief of PlayStation LifeStyle, an online forum and news site for fans.",

      "Sony kept up with the technology, packing a DVD into the PlayStation 2 so that buyers had another reason to buy the system. The PlayStation 2 remains the best selling console of all time, with some 160 million units sold.",

      "A rare confluence of factors makes the Atacama an ideal home for some of the world\u2019s biggest ground-based astronomical projects \u2014 dry climate, high altitude and, crucially, isolation from the light pollution of civilization.",
      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",

      "That means not only a major increase in light pollution but also new dust, ground vibrations and heightened atmospheric turbulence that blurs stars and makes them twinkle. All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",
      "\u201cMajor observatories have been chased out to remote locations, and essentially now they\u2019re chased out to some of the last remaining dark sky locations on Earth, like the Atacama Desert, the mountain peaks of Hawaii, areas around Tucson, Arizona,\u201d said Ruskin Hartley, the executive director of DarkSky International, a Tuscon-based nonprofit founded by astronomers.",

Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application.

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is making the rounds in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met separately with President Donald Trump and Republican senators Wednesday as tech executives work to secure favorable federal policies for the artificial intelligence industry, including the limited sale of Nvidia's highly valued computer chips to U.S. rivals like China.",
      "Huang's closed-door meeting with Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee came at a moment of intensifying lobbying, soaring investments and audacious forecasts by major tech companies about AI\u2019s potential transformative effects.",
      "Huang is among the Silicon Valley executives who warn that any restrictions on the technology will halt its advancement despite mounting concerns among policymakers and the public about AI's potential pitfalls or the ways foreign rivals like China may use American hardware.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\u201d Huang told reporters before his meeting on Capitol Hill.",
      "He added that he shared concerns about selling AI chips to China but believed that restrictions haven't slowed Chinese advancement in the AI race.",
      "\u201cWe need to be able to compete around the world. The one thing we can\u2019t do is we can\u2019t degrade the chips that we sell to China. They won\u2019t accept that. There\u2019s a reason why they wouldn\u2019t accept that, and so we should offer the most competitive chips we can to the Chinese market,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang also said he\u2019d met with Trump earlier Wednesday and discussed export controls for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Huang added that he wished the president \u201ca happy holidays.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration in May reversed Biden-era restrictions that had prevented Nvidia and other chipmakers from exporting their chips to a wide range of countries. The White House in August also announced an unusual deal that would allow Nvidia and another U.S. chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices, to sell their chips in the Chinese market but would require the U.S. government to take a 15% cut of the sales.",
      "The deal divided lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad support for controls on AI exports.",
      "Members of Congress have generally considered the sale of high-end AI chips to China to be a national security risk. China is the main competitor to the U.S. in the race to develop artificial superintelligence. Lawmakers have also proposed a flurry of bills this year to regulate AI's impact on dozens of industries, though none have become law.",

      "Asked whether he believed Nvidia's interests and goals were fully aligned with U.S. national security, Rounds replied: \u201cThey currently do not sell chips in China. And they understand that they\u2019re an American company. They want to be able to compete around the rest of the world. They\u2019d love to some time be able to compete in China again, but they recognize that export controls are important as well for our own national security.\"",
      "Other Republicans were more skeptical of Huang's message.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider him to be an objective, credible source about whether we should be selling chips to China,\u201d Kennedy told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s got more money than the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and he wants even more. I don\u2019t blame you for that, but if I\u2019m looking for someone to give me objective advice about whether we should make our technology available to China, he's not it.\"",
      "Some Democrats, shut out from the meeting altogether, expressed frustration at Huang's presence on Capitol Hill.",
      "\u201cEvidently, he wants to go lobby Republicans in secret rather than explain himself,\u201d said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.",

      "HONOLULU -- Survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor have long been the center of a remembrance ceremony held each year on the military base\u2019s waterfront.",
      "But today only 12 are still alive \u2014 all centenarians \u2014 and this year none is able to make the pilgrimage to Hawaii to mark the event, scheduled for Sunday.",
      "That means no one attending will have firsthand memories of serving during the attack, which killed more than 2,300 troops and catapulted the U.S. into World War 2. The development is not a surprise and is an evolution of an ongoing trend. As survivors fade, their descendants and the public are increasingly turning to other ways of learning about the bombing.",
      "\u201cThe idea of not having a survivor there for the first time \u2014 I just, I don\u2019t know \u2014 it hurt my heart in a way I can\u2019t describe,\u201d said Kimberlee Heinrichs, whose 105-year-old father Ira \u201cIke\u201d Schab had to cancel plans to fly in from Oregon after falling ill.",
      "Survivors have been present every year in recent memory except for 2020, when the Navy and the National Park Service closed the observance to the general public because of coronavirus pandemic health risks.",
      "The ceremony begins with a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m., the same time the attack began on Dec. 7, 1941. Solemn rituals follow.",
      "Fighter jets fly overhead in \u201cmissing man formation,\" in which one jet peels off to symbolize those lost. Survivors present wreaths to honor the dead, though active duty troops have assumed this job in recent years. Survivors rise to salute active duty sailors who themselves salute as their ship passes the USS Arizona Memorial, which sits above submerged hull of the battleship sunk in the attack.",
      "About 2,000 survivors attended the 50th anniversary event in 1991. A few dozen have showed in recent decades. Last year, only two made it. That is out of an estimated 87,000 troops stationed on Oahu that day.",
      "Many survivors were jovial despite the occasion, happy to catch up with old friends and pose for photographs. Even so, harrowing recollections were seldom far from their minds.",
      "In 2023, Harry Chandler gazed across the water while telling an Associated Press reporter how he was raising the flag at a mobile hospital in the hills above the base when he saw Japanese planes fly in and drop bombs. Chandler and his fellow Navy hospital corpsmen jumped in trucks to help the injured.",
      "He spoke of seeing the Arizona explode, and of hearing sailors trapped on the capsized USS Oklahoma desperately tapping on their ship's hull to summon rescue. He helped care for Oklahoma sailors after crews cut holes in the battleship.",
      "\u201cI can still see what was happening,\u201d Chandler said. He died the next year at a senior living center in Tequesta, Florida.",
      "The bombing has long held different meanings for different people, the historian Emily S. Rosenberg wrote in her book \u201cA Date Which Will Live: Pearl Harbor in American Memory.\u201d",
      "Some say it highlights the need for a well-prepared military and a vigilant foreign policy. To some it evokes then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration\u2019s \u201cineptitude or deceit\u201d and the unfair scapegoating of the military. Others focus on the \u201ctreachery\u201d of Japan or the heroic acts of individual troops, she wrote.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sylvester Stallone, Kiss and Gloria Gaynor are among the luminaries being celebrated Sunday at the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with Donald Trump hosting the show, the first time a president will command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he has lambasted as \u201cwoke\u201d anti-American culture.",
      "Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. The Republican president said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \u201cat the request of a certain television network.\u201d He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be something that I believe, and I\u2019m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they\u2019ve ever done and they\u2019ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there\u2019s nothing like what\u2019s going to happen\" on Sunday night, Trump said.",
      "Trump is assuming a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian and Trump nemesis Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees. Trump skipped the honors altogether during his first term.",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \u201cRocky\u201d and \u201cRambo\u201d movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \u201cI Will Survive\u201d and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and fire. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "The ceremony is expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band\u2019s original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall.",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center\u2019s programming and the building\u2019s appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \u201cTrump Kennedy Center.\u201d He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face to face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Trump\u2019s first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",

      "It wasn't always this way. The bayou was once shallower and just wide enough for a small boat to pass. Land that cattle once roamed is submerged now, and elders tell stories of tree canopies once so lush they nearly shut out the day.",
      "The delicate lattice of Louisiana's coastline has been steadily retreating for generations. As it does, the Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe and other Indigenous people are fighting to protect what's left and to adapt to their changing environment. That includes a painstaking effort to build makeshift reefs that slow erosion and sturdier homes and buildings to better withstand storms.",
      "\u201cWe want to be able to make it so that people can stay here for as long as possible, for as long as they want to stay,\u201d said Matherne, who as the tribe's director of daily operations helped coordinate its response to the erosion threat.",
      "They hope to avoid the fate of the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation, a nearby tribe that was forced to move three years ago about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north from the encroaching Gulf of Mexico. Isle de Jean Charles \u2014 their island home southwest of New Orleans \u2014 has lost 98% of its land.",
      "Louisiana's coast has been steadily retreating for several reasons.",
      "Levees along the Mississippi River have severed the natural flow of land-creating sand, silt and clay, starving wetlands of sediment they need to survive. Canals have allowed saltwater to flow into wetlands, killing freshwater vegetation that holds them together and accelerating erosion. Groundwater pumping is causing land to sink, and planet-warming emissions from burning coal, oil and gas are fueling hurricanes and accelerating sea level rise.",
      "Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost about 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land \u2014 sometimes fast, sometimes slow. A U.S. Geological Survey analysis found that when erosion was at its worst, a football field's worth of coastal wetlands was disappearing every 34 minutes.",
      "It\u2019s a difficult problem to solve without being able to count on the Mississippi River to periodically drop sediment to maintain the land, said Sam Bentley, geology professor at Louisiana State University.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to displace ecosystems, it\u2019s going to displace communities, it\u2019s going to isolate infrastructure that\u2019s along the coastline,\" Bentley said. \"And there are going to be a lot of changes that are very hard to deal with.\u201d",
      "Indigenous burial and cultural sites risk eroding, and traditional ways of life \u2014 shrimping, fishing and subsistence farming \u2014 are under pressure. Without action, researchers estimate the state could lose up to 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) \u2014 an area larger than Delaware \u2014 over the next 50 years.",
      "Reefs built from oyster shells are one attempt to stem the erosion.",
      "The oysters are collected from restaurants, stuffed into bags and stacked just off shore to form the reefs. The program, launched in 2014 by the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, has recycled more than 16 million pounds (7.3 million kilograms) of shells in that time. That's enough to protect about 1.5 miles (about 2.4 kilometers) of shoreline.",
      "Since the Pointe-au-Chien tribe had a 400-foot (123-meter) reef built in 2019 to protect a historic mound, the coalition has measured a 50% reduction in the rate of land loss where the reefs were built, said coalition spokesman James Karst.",
      "But there are limits to what reclaimed oyster shells can do. There just aren't enough shells for Louisiana's estimated 7,721-mile (12,426 kilometer) coastline, said Karst, and moving them is expensive, so they have to be strategic. Many reefs they've built protect sites of cultural importance. They're also limited to areas where the water is salty enough for the oyster shells to last.",
      "Their work might seem like a tiny drop in the bucket, \"but when you are losing land at the rate you are,\u201d Karst said, \u201cyou need all the drops in the bucket you can get.\u201d",

With help from groups like the Lowlander Center, a nonprofit working with Indigenous and coastal communities facing risks such as climate threats and land loss, the tribe is rebuilding in a stronger way.",
      "Homes are higher off the ground and fortified with hurricane straps, heavy-duty windows and doors that can take pummeling winds and waters. Electrical equipment is elevated to stay above storm surge. They've rebuilt or repaired 13 homes; about five new homes are planned and they're raising money to fortify the remaining dozen or so.",
      "\u201cWe know that doing just one home in a community doesn\u2019t make the community safe. It\u2019s only safe if the whole community is included in raising that level of safety,\u201d said Kristina Peterson, director and co-founder of the Lowlander Center.",
      "But challenges remain. The state-recognized tribes have struggled to get federal recognition, they said, and without it, it's hard to get grants and other help from the federal government. Instead, they rely on partnerships with organizations and institutions.",
      "The Trump administration's funding cuts are also making it harder for tribes to meet their goals.",
      "The Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw applied for a federal grant to build a community center stocked with food, water and renewable energy in case of emergencies that's designed to hold up during hurricanes. When cuts happened, their application was tabled.",
      "Similarly, the Pointe-au-Chien applied for money to install solar panels on every home, but they're not hopeful their application will get approved.",
      "Pointe-au-Chien elder Theresa Dardar said much has changed in the five decades she's lived there. The pond behind her home has gotten bigger, and she could once identify lakes Chien and Felicity. Now it\u2019s just one large body of water. People once hunted deer and walked through wooded areas.",
      "What hasn't changed is the quiet and the close ties. Everybody knows everybody. And people still fish like generations did before them.",
      "\u201cThis is where our ancestors were, and we feel like we would be abandoning them\u201d to leave, Dardar said. \u201cWe have sacred sites that we still visit.\u201d",
      "By slowing erosion and building more homes, the tribe hopes younger families will move to Pointe-au-Chien. They also know that protecting their lands from going underwater will protect regions further inland.",
      "As Dardar put it: \u201cWe're the buffer.\"",

It's one of many once-thriving Hispanic businesses, from Nicaraguan eateries to Honduran restaurants, emptied out in recent weeks in neighborhoods with lots of signs in Spanish but increasingly fewer people on the streets.",
      "In the city of Kenner, which has the highest concentration of Hispanic residents in Louisiana, a federal immigration crackdown aiming for 5,000 arrests has devastated an economy already struggling from ramped-up enforcement efforts this year, some business owners say, and had far-reaching impacts on both immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.",
      "\u201cFewer and fewer people came,\u201d said a crying Diaz, whose Taqueria La Conquistadora has been closed for several weeks now with both customers and workers afraid to leave home. \u201cThere were days we didn\u2019t sell anything. That\u2019s why I made the decision to close the business \u2014 because there was no business.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, convoys of federal vehicles began rumbling back and forth down Kenner's main commercial streets as the Department of Homeland Security commenced the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations that have included surges in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Bystanders have posted videos of federal agents detaining people outside Kenner businesses and at construction sites.",
      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino also made an appearance in the city, surrounded by agents in tactical gear, to tout to reporters the launch of the operation dubbed Catahoula Crunch, a name derived from the big game hound that is the Louisiana state dog.",
      "The state's Hispanic population has boomed in the last two decades, with many of them arriving in the aftermath of 2005's Hurricane Katrina to help rebuild. In Kenner, just west of New Orleans between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, Hispanics make up about 30% of residents.",
      "Diaz, who is from El Salvador, arrived in 2006 after years of doing farm work in Texas. She opened food trucks, earning enough to buy a home in Kenner, and her business has since expanded to a fleet of trucks and two brick-and-mortar restaurants.",

      "The nation's freight railroads are going to be able to try relying more on technology and inspect their tracks in person less often after the federal government approved their waiver request on Friday.",
      "The Association of American Railroads trade group asked for the relief from inspection requirements that were written back in 1971 because railroads believe the automated track inspection technology they use today is so good at spotting problems early that human inspections aren't needed as frequently. They say that extended tests that BNSF and Norfolk Southern ran show that safety actually improved even when human inspections were reduced from twice a week to twice a month.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration didn't go quite that far in its decision, but the agency said railroads will be able to cut inspections down to only once a week under the approved waiver.",
      "The railroads had also asked for permission to have up to three days to repair defects identified by the automated inspections. But the Federal Railroad Administration said any serious defects in the tracks must be repaired immediately and all defects should be addressed within 24 hours.",
      "These automated inspection systems use an array of cameras and lasers installed either on a locomotive or on a railcar that can be pulled as part of a train to assess whether the tracks are moving out of alignment or shifting. But the union that represents track inspectors says the technology can\u2019t detect things like the rock underneath the track shifting, vegetation growing into the path of the trains, a crack in the rail or railroad ties rotting out. Plus, inspectors can spot a combination of small defects that might together derail a train where the machine might not register a problem, the union says.",
      "\u201cThis is everyday defects across the entire country that we find through visual inspections that cannot be detected by this machinery,\u201d Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union President Tony Cardwell said. \u201cAnd that technology is not there. It has been here for 30 years. It hasn\u2019t really advanced much at all. It\u2019s a glorified tape measure.\u201d",
      "The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union that represents track inspectors acknowledges that this technology does help spot problems. But the union says that this automated inspection equipment should supplement \u2014 not replace \u2014 human inspections because reducing track inspections would increase the risk of derailments.",
      "The railroads counter that even if these systems can't see the ballast shifting under the tracks or the ties starting to rot, the system will notice the symptoms of those problems because the track geometry \u2014 basically the alignment of the tracks \u2014 will be affected when those things happen.",
      "\u201cWhat it is looking at is the ultimate performance. If those components are doing their job, then the track geometry is being maintained. If they\u2019re not doing their job, the track geometry is not being maintained,\u201d said Mike Rush, the Association of American Railroads' senior vice president of safety and operations.",

      "Over two years of testing, manual inspections detected only 0.01 defects per 100 miles, compared with the section of the railroad where the test was being run where the combination of the technology and reduced inspections found 4.54 defects per 100 miles.",
      "The Federal Railroad Administration agreed that tracks don't need to be inspected visually as frequently when these automated track inspection systems are used regularly.",
      "Cardwell and the union's safety director, Roy Morrison, think that's a bad idea. They said that one of the benefits of frequent inspections is that the inspectors become intimately familiar with their territories, which helps them spot subtle changes. If they aren't out on the tracks as often, it may be harder to spot problems, they said.",
      "\u201cA track inspector who\u2019s out on his mainline track twice a week, he knows that track inside out, and a lot of times he\u2019ll spot a defect without even knowing what he\u2019s looking at yet,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHe\u2019ll get out of the truck and say, hey, there\u2019s something wrong here. Take some measurements and go, OK, this is what\u2019s going on.\u201d",

Plus, Norfolk Southern noted in its comments on the request that even if regular inspections aren't being done as often, special inspections will still be done regularly anytime there is a major storm or flooding in a certain area to make sure the tracks weren't affected.",
      "Norfolk Southern said that during its 18-month test of reducing inspections while using the technology, the railroad saw improvements in areas that the automated system can't find because inspectors were free to spend more time focused on those areas.",

A third inmate who joined in the breakout killed himself after he was tracked down.",
      "It was the latest bold jail escape in Louisiana. Earlier this year 10 inmates broke out of a New Orleans jail after crawling through a hole behind a toilet.

      "Wednesday morning's escape, which took place at the St. Landry Parish Jail, involved three inmates. Sheriff Bobby J. Guidroz, who oversees the jail in Opelousas, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans, said the \"inmates discovered a degrading part of an upper wall area and over time, removed the mortar allowing them to remove concrete blocks and provide their exit.\u201d",

      "For the first time in a decade, hunters are fanning out across Florida to legally hunt the Florida black bear",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- For the first time in a decade, hunters armed with rifles and crossbows are fanning out across Florida's swamps and flatwoods to legally hunt the Florida black bear, over the vocal opposition of critics.",
      "The state-sanctioned hunt began Saturday, after drawing more than 160,000 applications for a far more limited number of hunting permits, including from opponents who are trying to reduce the number of bears killed in this year's hunt, the state's first since 2015.",
      "The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission awarded 172 bear hunt permits by random lottery for this year's season, allowing hunters to kill one bear each in areas where the population is deemed large enough. At least 43 of the permits went to opponents of the hunt who never intend to use them, according to the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, which encouraged critics to apply in the hopes of saving bears.",
      "The Florida black bear population is considered one of the state's conservation success stories, having grown from just several hundred bears in the 1970s to an estimated more than 4,000 today.",
      "Opponents have questioned whether the hunt was necessary, but they were unable to convince the courts to halt it.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The 172 people who were awarded a permit through a random lottery will be able to kill one bear each during the 2025 season, which runs from Dec. 6 to Dec. 28. The permits are specific to one of the state's four designated bear hunting zones, each of which have a hunting quota set by state officials based on the bear population in each region.",
      "In order to participate, hunters must hold a valid hunting license and a bear harvest permit, which costs $100 for residents and $300 for nonresidents, plus fees. Applications for the permits cost $5 each.",
      "The regulated hunt will help incentivize maintaining healthy bear populations, and help fund the work that is needed, according to Mark Barton of the Florida chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, an advocacy group that supported the hunt.",
      "Having an annual hunt will help guarantee funding to \"keep moving conservation for bears forward,\u201d Barton said.",
      "According to state wildlife officials, the bear population has grown enough to support a regulated hunt and warrant population management. The state agency sees hunting as an effective tool that is used to manage wildlife populations around the world, and allows the state to monetize conservation efforts through permit and application fees.",
      "\"While we have enough suitable bear habitat to support our current bear population levels, if the four largest subpopulations continue to grow at current rates, we will not have enough habitat at some point in the future,\" reads a bear hunting guide published by the state wildlife commission.",

      "This year\u2019s hunting plan has more stringent rules than the 2015 hunt, in which permits were provided to anyone who could pay for them, resulting in more than 3,700 permits issued. That led to a chaotic event that was shut down days early. Of the 304 bears killed, at least 38 were females with cubs, meaning the young bears may have died too.",
      "Ultimately, wildlife officials decided to call off the hunt after its second day after a higher than expected number of bears were killed, though hunters did not exceed the statewide quota.",
      "Doug Moore regularly sees bears on the more than 6,000 acres of timberland that he manages in northeast Florida. The president of a local hunting club, Moore is generally supportive of the new regulations for the bear hunt, even though he and his family members weren't issued a permit this year.",
      "Moore described the management of the 2015 hunt as \u201cfouled up\u201d and \u201ctotally wrong\" but said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing it right this time.\"",
      "Backers of the hunt have said that growing numbers of bears present a safety problem, with local officials sharing reports of bears on porches, rooting through garbage cans and roaming neighborhoods and playgrounds.",
      "Activists have argued that the state should instead focus on other means of curbing nuisance bears and assuring safety through better trash management.",
      "While opponents failed to convince a judge to stop the hunt, they were issued about a quarter of the overall permits, after activists applied for hunting tags they never intend to use.",

      "Chief Justice John Roberts has led the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority on a steady march of increasing the power of the presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- Chief Justice John Roberts has led the Supreme Court 's conservative majority on a steady march of increasing the power of the presidency, starting well before Donald Trump's time in the White House.",
      "The justices could take the next step in a case being argued Monday that calls for a unanimous 90-year-old decision limiting executive authority to be overturned.",
      "The court's conservatives, liberal Justice Elena Kagan noted in September, seem to be \u201craring to take that action.\u201d",
      "They already have allowed Trump, in the opening months of the Republican's second term, to fire almost everyone he has wanted, despite the court's 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor that prohibits the president from removing the heads of independent agencies without cause.",
      "The officials include Rebecca Slaughter, whose firing from the Federal Trade Commission is at issue in the current case, as well as officials from the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The only officials who have so far survived efforts to remove them are Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, and Shira Perlmutter, a copyright official with the Library of Congress. The court already has suggested that it will view the Fed differently from other independent agencies, and Trump has said he wants her out because of allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook says she did nothing wrong.",
      "Humphrey's Executor has long been a target of the conservative legal movement that has embraced an expansive view of presidential power known as the unitary executive.",
      "The case before the high court involves the same agency, the FTC, that was at issue in 1935. The justices established that presidents \u2014 Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt at the time \u2014 could not fire the appointed leaders of the alphabet soup of federal agencies without cause.",
      "The decision ushered in an era of powerful independent federal agencies charged with regulating labor relations, employment discrimination, the air waves and much else.",
      "Proponents of the unitary executive theory have said the modern administrative state gets the Constitution all wrong: Federal agencies that are part of the executive branch answer to the president, and that includes the ability to fire their leaders at will.",
      "As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a 1988 dissent that has taken on mythical status among conservatives, \u201cthis does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power.\u201d",
      "Since 2010 and under Roberts' leadership, the Supreme Court has steadily whittled away at laws restricting the president's ability to fire people.",

      "In the 2024 immunity decision that spared Trump from being prosecuted for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, Roberts included the power to fire among the president's \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d powers that Congress lacks the authority to restrict.",
      "But according to legal historians and even a prominent proponent of the originalism approach to interpreting the Constitution that is favored by conservatives, Roberts may be wrong about the history underpinning the unitary executive.",

      "That might affect Cook's ability to remain in her job. The justices have seemed wary about the economic uncertainty that might result if Trump can fire the leaders of the central bank. The court will hear separate arguments in January about whether Cook can remain in her job as her court case challenging her firing proceeds.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration will start sending more water to California farmers in the state's crop-rich Central Valley",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration is making good on a promise to send more water to California farmers in the state\u2019s crop-rich Central Valley.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on Thursday announced a new plan for operating the Central Valley Project, a vast system of pumps, dams and canals that direct water southward from the state\u2019s wetter north. It follows an executive order President Donald Trump signed in January calling for more water to flow to farmers, arguing the state was wasting the precious resource in the name of protecting endangered fish species.",
      "Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the plan will help the federal government \u201cstrengthen California\u2019s water resilience.\" It takes effect Friday.",
      "But California officials and environmental groups blasted the move, saying sending significantly more water to farmlands could threaten water delivery to the rest of the state and would harm salmon and other fish.",
      "Most of the state\u2019s water is in the north, but most of its people are in the south. The federally-managed Central Valley Project works in tandem with the state-managed State Water Project, which sends water to cities that supply 27 million Californians. The systems transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuary that provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife including salmon and the delta smelt.",
      "It is important for the two systems to work together, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement. She warned the Trump administration\u2019s plan could limit the state's ability to send water to cities and farmers. That is because the state could be required to devote more water to species protection if the federal project sends more to farms.",
      "Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director at Restore the Delta, said pumping more water out would result in more Delta smelt and juvenile salmon dying from getting stuck in the pumping system, and once the temperature warms, harmful algae blooms will develop that are dangerous to fish, wildlife, pets and people. That could have economic impacts, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you destroy water quality and divorce it from land, you are also destroying property values,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to live near a fetid, polluted backwater swamp.\u201d",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation denied the changes would harm the environment or endangered species.",
      "The Central Valley Project primarily sends water to farms, with a much smaller amount going to cities and industrial use. Water from the Central Valley Project irrigates roughly one-third of California agriculture, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "The Westlands Water District, one of the largest uses of Central Valley Project water, cheered the decision. It \u201cwill help ensure that our growers have the water they need to support local communities and the nation\u2019s food supply, while also protecting California\u2019s wildlife,\u201d general manager Allison Febbo said in a statement.",

      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:06:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The star of \"Blue Moon\" talks about playing famed songwriter Lorenz Hart, whose successful collaboration with Richard Rodgers ended owing to Hart's heavy drinking; and about his own youthful ambitions.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a hundred years ago, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart helped put the \"great\" in the Great American Songbook, with songs like \"My Funny Valentine,\" \"The Lady Is a Tramp,\" and \"Blue Moon.\"",
      "But by the early 1940s, Hart's heavy drinking made him an unreliable partner. So, Rodgers teamed up with Oscar Hammerstein II, and their first production, the landmark musical \"Oklahoma!\" opened at the St. James Theatre on March 31, 1943.",
      "It was an immediate hit, and that night there was a big party a few doors down at Sardi's, that legendary Broadway watering hole, with its walls hung with the caricatures of famous faces. Lorenz Hart showed up at Sardi's that night, and what happened next is now a movie.",
      "In \"Blue Moon,\" Ethan Hawke is Hart, drowning his sorrows at the bar.",
      "For the film, they re-created Sardi's on a soundstage, but \"Sunday Morning\" met Hawke at the real thing.",
      "\"I was definitely the type of young person that would walk in and think, 'When am I gonna get my painting up there?'\" he said. \"I'm not above that. I'm a little heartbroken that I don't have one up yet!\"",
      "Perhaps his time will come. \"My time's coming,\" he said. \"I have hope. I'm not done yet!\"",
      "And this performance is proof: the real Lorenz Hart was less than five feet tall, so director and frequent Hawke collaborator Richard Linklater used camera tricks to make the nearly six-foot actor look short. Hawke also shaved the top of his head to make a real combover, and he learned a mountain of dialogue.",
      "\"It's definitely the most text I've ever had in a movie,\" Hawke said. \"I remember calling my wife after the first day \u2013 I think I had more lines than I had in the previous five films.\"",
      "It was a challenge for an actor whose face usually says it all. In the 1989 film \"Dead Poets Society,\" Hawke played a student, and he says he learned a lot from co-star Robin Williams. \"There's a scene where he's talking about how to grade poetry, and he has all the kids rip it out \u2013 I didn't realize how much I was being taught, and how that sustained me through negative criticism. It's like, there's not any rules about being a great actor. Drop dead. So you don't like it? Suck an egg. You don't know what great acting is any more than I do.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you're in a movie like that so young, does it set you up? Or does it set you up?\"",
      "\"It's a great question, 'cause it's possibly both,\" he replied. \"If you let it be the high-water mark of your life, it will be, you know, if you put too much on that. You don't want anything at 18 to be the high-water mark of your life.\"",
      "Between movies, Hawke made his Broadway debut with, he says, a lot more confidence than skill. \"That's the weird thing about being young. I had no business being confident at anything. I was a total moron. And I walked in here like I was, you know, John Barrymore.\"",
      "His performance in Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" (1992) was described as \"promising.\" But it was clear that his best work was ahead of him.",
      "Hawke got the first of four Oscar nominations for his role in the 2001 film \"Training Day\" opposite Denzel Washington. His performance still resonates. Hawke said, \"When my son was about six, Levon, he said to me, 'Dad, what's \"Training Day?\"' I said, 'Oh, it's the movie I did a few years ago. Why?' He said, \"'cause every time we walk down the street, when people pass you, they say, \"Training Day\"!'\"",
      "But after \"Training Day,\" there was a time when Hawke says he passed on more parts than he took \u2013 and the offers started drying up. \"When you're young, you think it's everybody. You don't realize that This is a young person's game, and those kinds of job offers, there's a shelf life on that.\"",
      "\"When did your shelf life, when did that hit?\" I asked.",
      "\"Around the same time gray starts appearing in your beard,\" he replied.",
      "The gray in the beard works for him now, as a hard-nosed investigative reporter in the critically-acclaimed FX series \"The Lowdown.\" In the series, you never know what's around the next corner \u2013 just as in real life. As we were wrapping up at Sardi's, owner Max Klimavicius suddenly showed up with a surprise for Hawke: \"Ethan, I would like your permission to make you part of our collection,\" he said.",
      "He was a bit stunned, and to be honest, so were we. But after Ethan Hawke's career on screen and stage, it wasn't all that surprising.",
      "\"Wow!\" he said. \"It finally happened. I've got my portrait at Sardi's. I've arrived! Things are looking up in this life!\"",
      "And now, with his latest film in mind, there's talk of more accolades to come.",
      "How does he handle the Oscar buzz surrounding \"Blue Moon\"? Does he tune it out? He said, \"There's the obvious other part of you that goes, like, 'Hey, I dedicated my life to this job, and this is seen as a barometer.' And I would be dishonest if I didn't say that, like, that would be amazing.",
      "\"This is so corny, but it just flashed through my head: I was like 11 or something, I said to my mother, 'What's gonna happen with my life? What's gonna happen?' And she \u2013 and I remember it so vividly \u2013 in the kitchen, like Doris Day [sings] 'When I was just a little girl\u2026' you know, it goes into 'Que Sera, Sera.'",
      "\"You have to have a little 'Que Sera, Sera.' I don't take any of it for granted. That's, I guess, the right answer. Any little bit of it.\"",

    "summary": "Elvis Presley biographer Peter Guralnick's latest book, \"The Colonel and the King,\" is the story of a partnership that rocked popular culture, and how Colonel Parker's marketing savvy and enduring loyalty helped the King get his crown.",
    "story": [
      "Author Peter Guralnick wrote the definitive two-volume biography of the King: \"Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley\" (1994), and \"Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley\" (2000). And now, his latest is about Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis' legendary manager. Asked if he found anything surprising, Guralnick replied, \"It totally surprised me.\"",
      "\"The Colonel and the King: Tom Parker, Elvis Presley, and the Partnership that Rocked the World\" (Little, Brown & Co.) is the story of a partnership that rocked popular culture, and how Parker's marketing savvy and enduring loyalty helped the King get his crown.",
      "Guralnick says Parker did not create the template for being the manager of a musician: \"It wasn't original to him, it wasn't brand new. But he carried it, I think, to a far greater extent than anyone had before.\"",
      "In 1955, the 20-year-old Presley was playing the Louisiana Hayride when Parker first caught his act. \"It took no more than a few days after seeing him for the first time that he booked Elvis when nobody else was willing to book him,\" Guralnick said.",
      "Parker, who was then handling Hank Snow, quickly put Elvis in the show.",
      "Elvis would sell more than 12 million records in 1956. The Colonel negotiated his recording contract, his movie deal, and oversaw all his marketing.\u00a0 As he would write, \"I don't [just] sit here and smoke cigars hoping for something to happen.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"There is so much love in some of his early letters to Elvis. And in one he says, you know, 'You are just like me. You are sensitive, you're easily hurt. But only those we love can hurt us.'\"",
      "Presley would write back, \"I love you like a father.\"",
      "Colonel Tom Parker wasn't actually a colonel; he also wasn't American. In fact, Andreas van Kuijk was a stowaway from Holland, who arrived in the U.S. in 1926, barely speaking English. The 16-year-old soon invented an origin story. \"Once he declared himself to be Tom Parker, born in West Virginia, his identity was never questioned for over 50 years,\" said Guralnick. \"The only person who may have known it was Elvis Presley.\"",
      "The honorary title \"Colonel\" would be bestowed on him by Louisiana's Governor. It became his first name. \"That was how he signed all of his letters,\" said Guralnick.",
      "Before Presley, Parker made a star out of Eddy Arnold, booking him as the first \"hillbilly act\" in Vegas.",
      "Actor George Hamilton, who befriended the Colonel in his early days in Hollywood, said, \"He had all the smarts of a con man, but he wasn't. He knew how to make the other person want whatever he was selling.\"",
      "Asked why Parker was so driven, Hamilton replied, \"Emotional stuff from his childhood. I feel like he had some horrible damage done. He didn't like his father.\"",
      "Parker would become notorious for taking a 50% cut of some of Presley's later deals. \"Now, I sat with him one day and I said, 'Is it right to get half of everything?'\" Hamilton recalled. \"And he said, 'Well, you know, 50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.' And I said, 'Well, you mean your half, or his?' He said, 'Well, if I didn't have my half, he wouldn't have his!' And I got it. I got it.\"",
      "The Colonel offered Hamilton an opportunity in Vegas: \"He said, 'And by the way, Elvis has gotta take two weeks off at the Hilton. And I booked you in.' I said, 'I can't do that show. That doesn't make any sense, Colonel.' He said, 'George, you want $50,000 a week?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'It's two weeks. For that, you can do anything, can't you?' I said, 'Yes, sir!'\"",
      "In 1973, after Presley bad-mouthed hotel owner Conrad Hilton on stage in Vegas, Parker confronted him backstage. \"Essentially, Elvis and Colonel fired each other,\" said Guralnick.",
      "The split didn't last long. \"Neither Colonel nor Elvis could imagine a world without the other,\" said Guralnick. \"They simply didn't have the ability to walk away.\"",
      "But Parker began to worry about the \"instability of [his] artist.\"",
      "Asked how he reacted to Presley's increasing drug use, Guralnick replied, \"I think he was at a loss. I think there was an element of denial. But he was well aware of what was going on. Nobody could miss what was going on.\"",
      "In Vegas, Colonel developed his own addiction. George Hamilton saw it firsthand: \"He used to get me to go gambling with him. God! He would go all-in on, like, I mean, big money. I saw close to a million dollars lost at a table.\"",
      "Guralnick said, \"They were caught in a trap \u2013 as Elvis sang! I mean, neither one of them could confront the other one with his problem.\"",
      "According to the author, the two were locked in a relationship of mutual denial \u2013 the twin tragedies of their story. And when Elvis died in 1977, the Colonel, according to Guralnick, \"went into shock.\"",
      "\"I'll never stop trying to keep nis name alive,\" Parker said. He would die in 1997.",
      "While Guralnick was doing research at Elvis' Memphis mansion Graceland, in what was once the office of Elvis' father, Vernon Presley, he was told the office telephone was disconnected: \"So, one night we were working quite late, and it was 10 o'clock at night. And all of a sudden, the phone rang. And so you know, you'll have to tell me: Was this Elvis? Was this Vernon? Maybe it was Colonel.",
      "\"We stared at it. Should we answer? Should we not answer? Who knows what would happen if we answered? But we did not answer. We just listened to it ring, until it finally stopped ringing!\"",
      "\"You wanted the idea that there was one of those three on the other end of the line?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, you want to preserve the mystery!\"",

      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Anthony Mason's interview with Peter Guralnick on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" December 7!",
      "\"The Colonel and the King\" by Peter Guralnick",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "The Beginning of It All",
      "He first became aware of the boy in early 1955 through an old pal in Texarkana, Arkansas, a DJ, radio personality, and promoter named Ernest Hackworth who went by the name of Uncle Dudley. Hackworth, who, like so many other promoters, worked on his own shows as a country comedian, reported that this kid from Memphis had drawn more than eight hundred people to a little schoolhouse in New Boston, Texas, on January 11, which was a heckuva draw for an unknown artist whose name he usually got all jumbled up.",
      "Oddly enough, Colonel was later reminded, he had actually been told about the boy two months earlier by another old colleague, Oscar Davis, who was wont to say he had made several fortunes (true\u2014he had managed Hank Williams at the height of his career) and lost even more (equally true). Davis, a smooth-tongued, silver-haired operator who went back even further than Colonel in the world of carnivals and show business, was a peer- less pitchman, always immaculately dressed, always sharp as a tack\u2014in the view of a mutual acquaintance who did business with them both, he differed from Colonel in only two ways. Unlike Colonel, Oscar Davis looked the part, \"he looked like the man with the money\"\u2014 but also unlike Colonel (with whom you could operate with complete confidence on a handshake basis) you couldn't trust a word that he said.",
      "Oscar had hit a rough patch lately and was advancing an Eddy Arnold tour for Colonel when he met this Presley boy in Memphis and had even gone to see him perform at some little club where the kid had really gotten the audience worked up. But for one reason or another, it seemed like Oscar wasn't emphasizing the point too strongly, or maybe Colonel just wasn't listening that closely (with Oscar Davis, you didn't want to over-listen), so it wasn't until Uncle Dudley spoke to him the day after the New Boston show that he paid attention.",
      "This time there was no hesitation.",
      "He and Tom Diskin went to see Presley perform at the Louisiana Hayride three days later, and he was so knocked out, not so much by the music\u2014he really wasn't sure at first what to make of the music\u2014as by the reaction of the crowd, that he got in touch with Presley's manager, a Memphis DJ named Bob Neal, right away. Within a week he had him booked on the Hank Snow tour that was about to begin in New Mexico on February 14. Even before the start of the tour, apparently on the strength of the Hayride performance alone, Colonel approached Steve Sholes about signing him to RCA, but as it turned out, the head of Presley's little record label in Memphis, Sam Phillips, wouldn't hear of it, in fact he seemed almost insulted by the idea, so Colonel was forced to let Steve know that it looked like Presley was \"pretty securely tied up\" for the time being.",
      "From the very first dates on the New Mexico tour, the boy's talent\u2014not just his talent but his drive, and especially his capacity for growth\u2014were unmistakable. When asked some eighteen months later if he took credit for Elvis Presley's unparalleled success, the Colonel uncharacteristically demurred. \"I think Presley was a star from the first day he ever started going into show business,\" he said. \"I knew I could help him, [but] I think anyone could have helped him that knows something about show business.\"",
      "It was astounding, the speed with which it happened.",
      "Everywhere the Hank Snow\u2013headlined revue played, the clamor over Presley's performance only grew, and many nights he took the show. Hank Snow tried to hide his reaction, but Colonel could not help but be aware of it and all the ways his client's wounded vanity played out. The boy never seemed to notice, though; he clearly thought the world of Snow, and Colonel did all he could to smooth things over, pointing out that everywhere they went, they were breaking attendance records, which surely had to be considered a tribute to the star of the show.",
      "Things could not have been going better, in fact, for the new partnership between Colonel Tom Parker and Hank Snow. Record sales were up, and due to his assiduous efforts, Colonel never tired of reminding Snow, all sorts of new, high-paying opportunities in radio and television were starting to open up. The trades attributed these rapidly expanding horizons to a unique artist-manager relationship which Cash Box would describe as \"based on loyalty, mutual respect and a common objective,\" not to mention the uncommon efforts of Tom Parker, \"a colorful personality [with] a natural flair for showmanship [who is] known from coast to coast . . . and respected for his sound business principles [and his] policy of doing more than he has promised.\"",
      "But, tellingly, Colonel didn't book Elvis with Hank again until May, while Hank continued to do record-breaking business on his own.",
      "One of the stumbling blocks\u2014the principal stumbling block\u2014to his doing more with Presley was the boy's manager, Bob Neal, who seemed infuriatingly unsusceptible to persuasion, promotion, or even recognition of his own (let alone his artist's) ever-increasing opportunities. During a brief break from touring at the beginning of March, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin, clearly disheartened by his inability to make any headway with Neal. \"I don't see much use in wasting any [more] money or time on Presley till we know that they need us, and only when they contact us direct for help in some way.\" Things were slow in the business in general, he noted, but he had not given up on improving Hank's royalty situation with RCA, or maybe even moving him to his old friend Randy Wood's Dot label (though in all likelihood, here he was merely musing out loud, for his own and Tom Diskin's benefit, about something that would almost certainly have been little more than a negotiating ploy). Meanwhile, he thought he would set up another strong ten- or fifteen-day tour for Hank, \"keep getting special deals lined up,\" and focus on getting him another guest shot on TV with Perry Como.",
      "But as frustrated as he was by the Presley situation, he was not about to give up. Finally, on March 29, he was able to come to some sort of agreement with Bob Neal for a two-week series of one-nighters in Florida with Hank Snow, but he couldn't resist needling Neal while at the same time trying to steer him toward a more realistic appraisal of the situation. Neal had to pay more attention to business, he wrote with unfeigned indignation. He had to get the Colonel a complete supply of photos and records right away. And most important of all, the boy was never going to get anywhere so long as he was on Sun Records. \"I am finding out that in some places they have never heard of Elvis. . . . this I am not saying to knock, as you well know but to drive home the fact how sad it is that this boy does not get the spread he needs on his records.\" And when Neal failed at this task, as at every other, he wrote again\u2014and again.",
      "The Florida tour was a triumph beyond anything that could have been imagined.",
      "On the first date, in Daytona Beach on May 7, Mae Boren Axton, a forty-year-old high school English teacher and sometime songwriter from Jacksonville, who had been doing advance press work in the area for the Colonel for the last year or two, witnessed a kind of crowd reaction she had never seen before. A well-educated woman from a prominent political family in Oklahoma (her nephew David later became governor of the state and a three-term U.S. senator), she had grown up, she said, with \"no idea\" of what hillbilly music was, but she had come to like it from all the promotion work she had done for numerous hillbilly jamborees over the last few years. Now, in her capacity as Colonel's designated press officer, she undertook to conduct an interview with Elvis before the show, one of the first real interviews he had ever done, she imagined, judging from his polite, tongue-tied responses\u2014but then she was almost struck dumb herself by the altogether unexpected explosiveness of his act. At one point she ran across one of her former students while Elvis was still onstage, \"and she was just right into it, didn't know who he was, none of them did. But she was just ahhhh\u2014all of them were, even some of the old ones were doing like that. I looked at the faces\u2014they were loving it. And I said, 'Hey, honey, what is it about this kid?' And she said, 'Awww, Miz Axton, he's just a great big beautiful hunk of forbidden fruit.'\"",
      "In Orlando, four nights later, the crowd called for Elvis to come back when Hank Snow took the stage, and could not be quieted during Snow's performance. The reporter for the local paper, a complete neophyte to this kind of music (it provided \"a poignant contrast to Metropolitan Opera in Atlanta, I must say,\" she acknowledged to her readers), gave a reasonably enthusiastic account of the entire evening, \"but what really stole the show was this 20- year-old sensation, Elvis Presley, a real sex box as far as the teenage girls are concerned. They squealed themselves silly over this fellow in orange coat and sideburns who 'sent' them. . . . Following the program, Elvis was surrounded by girlies asking for autographs. He would give each a long, slow look with drooped eyelids and comply. They ate it up.\" Which evolved in the blink of an eye into a full-scale riot in Jacksonville, when, at the conclusion of his act, Elvis announced, \"Girls, I'll see you all backstage.\"",
      "\"I heard feet like a thundering herd,\" Mae Axton recalled, \"and the next thing I knew I heard this voice from the shower area, and Elvis was on top of one of the showers looking sheepish and scared, and his shirt was shredded and his coat was torn to pieces . . . he was up there with nothing but his pants on and they were trying to pull at them up on the shower.\" The Colonel, said Mae, \"and I don't mean it derogatorily, got dollar marks in his eyes.\"",
      "But I think even Mae would be willing to admit that this was a reductive picture of a man she had come to admire for both his intellect and determination. Because she could tell even then that from Colonel's perspective Elvis Presley was not just another passing fancy to be cashed in on and forgotten, he was, potentially, a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.",
      "Within days Colonel was hard at work trying to set up another Florida tour. Once again, Bob Neal's refusal, or simply inability, to take a businesslike approach was an obstacle, but one which Colonel was confident he could overcome. On May 25 he wrote to Neal in what could be taken as a lesson in coercive persuasion: \"I was most happy to do what I could to help Elvis and you in getting him across in these new markets. . . . I am always glad to work with both of you, I am not one of the type of personalities that tries to cut out a manager, as you well know a good many would do. . . . If ever you wish to tie in with me closely and let me carry the ball I will be happy to sit down with both of you and try to work it out.\" Evidently that must have struck a chord with Neal, who instantly initiated a phone call, which in turn prompted a second letter from Colonel, spelling out terms and conditions and laying out \"the protection I must have to enable [me] to tie these things up and not be fanning the air and spent my money foolish.\"",
      "He felt no need to mention it at the time, but the second Florida tour, scheduled to begin in just two months, would take place without the presence of Hank Snow. Snow instead would be heading up a West Coast tour of his own, his first all-out assault on that market, which would be operating under the direction of Tom Diskin and conclude with a triumphal appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. Colonel made sure that Hank understood that he was not abdicating managerial responsibility, that every aspect of the tour would be plotted out by himself and Mr. Diskin, and that it would, of course, be fully supported by RCA. But in fact Hank couldn't have been more pleased, and if he were to be perfectly honest about it, he would not miss the presence of Presley in the least. And it wasn't as if he were losing anything on the deal. As a partner in Hank Snow Enterprises\u2013Jamboree Attractions, he stood only to gain by the addition of another big moneymaking tour in whose profits he would be a full participant.",
      "In the meantime, while fully engaged in the setup of both tours, Colonel continued to go back and forth with Bob Neal about the smallest, and largest, of matters. He dangled the promise of two weeks in Las Vegas (\"The [club] owner is a good friend of mine\"), which surely he would have had difficulty delivering on, but Neal didn't bite. He continued to hector Neal about his inattention to business (\"I have been waiting to hear from you,\" again, and again, and again), without any tangible results. Finally, he arranged to meet with Neal in person about a whole panoply of issues, including, once again, trying to shop Presley's record contract to a major label, about which he believed they had finally reached agreement, only to hear back from Neal three days later: \"Hold off any further announcements regarding Elvis until I have more time with him.\"",
      "On June 25, Colonel wrote to Tom Diskin in what appears to be barely concealed, barely punctuated frustration. \"Get it in your mind that there is no future in anything but big deals, no small time stuff it takes as much time and no money can be made of it. You have to believe this so strongly that you will let no one get your time and ear on junk deals. Everytime we have become involved in something small [and here it is hard to believe that he is not for the first time wondering if this is how the whole Elvis experience will turn out] we have lost time money and get nowhere.\"",
      "Just how discouraged he must have been feeling is evident in the entirely unaccustomed rush of emotion that he pours into what he writes next to Diskin, with whom he has been working in perfect harmony for three years now without ever once communicating just how much the younger man's contributions have meant to him. \"The future looks very good for you if you want to make it that way,\" he writes, in a passage posing as well-meant advice for a junior partner who needs bucking up, but which could just as easily be taken as a confidence-building message to Colonel himself. \"I will always protect you all I can/and I know you do the same. You are good for me and I know that I do understand you better than any-one could. Your closer to me than any-one ever has been and will be. and I know you understand me.\"",
      "The return to Florida, beginning on July 25 and ending seven days later with a benefit show in Tampa sponsored by the Sertoma Club and Clyde Rinaldi, proved to be even more spectacular than the first tour. The all-star cast was headlined by comedian-actor Andy Griffith, but it was Elvis who took the show every night, astonishing not only the audience but his fellow performers. Once again there was a riot in Jacksonville in the course of which Elvis once again had his clothes torn off, something the Colonel made sure to mention two weeks later in an exhortatory letter to Sam Weisbord, one of William Morris' most senior West Coast agents.",
      "He was enclosing a set of action pictures he had had taken in Tampa, he wrote to Weisbord. (One of them would become the arresting cover of Elvis' first RCA album some eight months later.) He was also enclosing a selection of his records. \"He is presently on a small record label and they have sold this year over 100,000 of this boy's records already, and they have no distribution whatsoever. . . . This artist seems to me to be right in line for motion picture material, television, and a stage career. . . . With the right training and advice and good material the possibilities are unlimited. His exposure on the stage does 75% towards the public accepting this artist. The talents that are hidden in this personality are unlimited.\"",
      "He didn't hesitate to invoke Hank Snow, another well-regarded William Morris client, who \"has done much to expose the talents of ELVIS PRESLEY, as he has taken him more or less under his wing and has been plugging away on all his personals and blowing the bugle about ELVIS PRESLEY.\"",
      "And he summed it all up on a not altogether unexpected note. \"I can only go so far without the help of friends like you towards making the world aware of such great talent. You have forgotten more than I'll ever know about how to bring this out in an artist and I'm asking you for advice to carry on and get the best results out of and for ELVIS PRESLEY and all of us.\"",
      "He copied the letter to Harry Kalcheim, the head of William Morris' New York office, who had been instrumental in helping to broaden Eddy Arnold's appeal with key supper-club and television bookings. And he continued to bombard Steve Sholes at RCA with letters and telegrams, ostensibly under the guise of tipping him off to something that Colonel was good enough not to want him to miss.",
      "This might all be taken as Colonel's usual method of operation, of course\u2014and in many respects it was. But the lack of caution, the abandonment of all of his usual, carefully calibrated reserve, was something new. Certainly he had felt the same kind of full-blown belief in Eddy Arnold and the vast potential of his talent\u2014but he had always proceeded with an element of circumspection, taking each incremental step only after he was confident of the success of the last. With Presley he was making no such allowance for failure. If the boy failed, he was leaving himself nothing to fall back on. Because here it was not just Elvis Presley's musical talent that foretold an almost limitless future (though that may well have been enough in itself), it was his spongelike ability to absorb and reshape everything that he took in and experienced, his seemingly inexhaustible appetite for self-improvement. As Colonel would one day remark in comparing Presley's talent with that of Gene Austin, his first superstar, both were \"individual artists [who] have a feeling inside them for what they are doing which you can't teach anyone.\" And as he was quick to point out with more than just a smidgen of irony, \"I, as a salesman and drummer, know this [better] than the average guy.\"",

      "New York Times bestselling author Jan Karon returns to the village of Mitford in her 15th novel featuring Father Tim Kavanagh, \"My Beloved\" (G.P. Putnam's Sons).",

      "Father Kavanagh",
      "Pen in hand and his notebook open before him, he was ready to do what he did every November: Get started on his Christmas list.",
      "He had vacated the French desk in the study and adopted the kitchen island as a command center. At the east end of the island, he wrote letters, paid bills, stashed his laptop, and kept a handy trove of books. The west end was reserved for culinary pursuits.",
      "When Cynthia cooked, he often read aloud to her from Mary Oliver, Billy Collins, Wendell Berry, or, out of long affection, George Herbert and Wordsworth. Early on, they agreed that poetry paired well with food prep, fiction worked best after dinner, and nonfiction was for reading alone, silent as a monk.",
      "By seven-thirty a.m., he had prayed with his wife, checked his sugar, had his shot, and polished off his stone-ground oatmeal with raw honey and multigrain toast. This upbeat start on the morning had made him over-confident \u2013 his pen was poised but nothing was happening. The grand expectation of churning through the list was morphing into a muse.",
      "He considered the books spilling out of their allotted space and encroaching on the laptop. Back in the day, which seemed a cool hundred years ago, he'd been a bachelor priest in his slip-covered wingchair, avidly reading through a pile of books. Books were his friends, his family, his mode of travel, his relief from the woes of the vestry.",
      "Somehow, and certainly not by his own effort, he'd gone from a bachelor with blood kin consisting of one lone cousin, Walter, to a family his cousin called 'humongous.' While such a family delivered equally humongous dividends of pleasure, his reading time had taken a hit.",
      "Before Cynthia, he'd been unmoored by the prospect of sharing his time with a wife. How much of his time could a wife possibly need? Now he knew and he did not regret even a minute with his cheerful, artistic, and beautiful wife. He was unmoored no more; but settled in. In a groove, you might say, though definitely not in a rut.",
      "And there was Dooley \u2013 not of his blood, but of his heart. At the age of eleven, Dooley had landed on his doorstep, a thrown-away boy \u2013 barefoot in shredded overalls, with a mouth that a mother of yore would have washed out with soap. Call it a miracle that today his adopted son \u2013 now a successful veterinarian with his own practice \u2013 had a beautiful, artistic wife himself. And two kids that Cynthia and he were over the moon about.",
      "A phenomenal string of events had cast him in roles he'd never dreamed of fulfilling \u2013 father, husband, father-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, great-uncle, grandfather.",
      "There was Jack, a lovable seven-year-old mash-up of cowboy boots and imagination, and Sadie, a going-on-three-year-old who had taken down every defense in her grandpa's arsenal. He'd never given his heart so freely.",
      "With Cynthia, he'd fought giving his heart. There was the inarguable fact that he'd already given it to God \u2013 though only to a certain degree, as he later realized. That had seen him through a decades-long passage until he had a revelation: God's love for his children wasn't just for them to have and to hold, it was to freely, spontaneously give away \u2013 and to gratefully receive from others. Why hadn't he understood this before?",
      "That awakening had opened both his heart and his intellect to a sober realization \u2013 while he'd spent years being afraid to love, he'd been far more terrified of receiving it. He had begun at once to work these truths into daily practice. Not easy. And not overnight. But the process had performed its share of miracles \u2013 had, in fact, at the tender age of sixty-two, gotten him married.",
      "His abandoned French desk, given to him recently by a former parishioner, now displayed an archive of framed family photos. There was Dooley and Lace's Sadie, miraculously born to a mother long pronounced unable to conceive.",
      "A few years ago, he learned he had a half-brother. Out of time and despair, hope and prayer, Henry \u2013 a brother. They both resolved to drop the 'half' business. He and Cynthia had attended Henry's Holly Springs wedding \u2013 an event that gave him a witty and agreeable sister-in-law. He studied the wedding photograph, searching Henry's face for any resemblance to his own. Zero. But they both loved poetry and starched handkerchiefs and letters written in cursive. He had a laugh at the memory of taking Henry by the shoulders, looking him in the eye, and saying, 'Brother, I forgive you for being taller and better-looking.'",
      "To go from a family consisting of a cousin to the present-day slew was a sea change, calling for a new way of dealing with Christmas giving. In years past, he had made a list. Now he must make A List.",
      "Cynthia breezed into the kitchen in a vague cloud of her signature wisteria scent.",
      "'You wear perfume for the grans?'",
      "'Jack says he loves the way his Granny smells \u2013 it makes him sneeze. He also loves making his own picture book. You'll see it soon; it's about bugs. When he turns all that talent loose in the world ... wow! How about your Poetry with Grandpa syllabus?'",
      "'I need one more run through the town library. Poetry for three-year-olds is scarce.' As Lace's mural-painting commissions increased, she needed help with the kids. He and Cynthia were giving a hand when Lily Flower was otherwise employed.",
      "His wife was applying lipstick without the aid of a mirror. It was his job to give a thumbs-up if she hit the mark. She hit the mark while eyeing the kitchen island.",
      "'Could you clean some of the stuff off the counter?' she said. 'It runneth over.'",
      "'I was just thinking that.'",
      "'I'm making pasta for the weekend and ... ' She gestured. ' . . . all those Billy Collins books.'",
      "'But you love Billy Collins.'",
      "'I'm crazy about Billy Collins, but not when I'm making pasta, which takes up gobs of room.'",
      "'Consider it done.'",
      "She gave him a smooch on the cheek. 'Love you, sweetheart.'",
      "'Love you back.'",
      "'Are you off to the hospital?'",
      "'Tomorrow,' he said.",
      "'See you at five, then. Could you pick up a lemon for tonight?'",
      "'Will do. Anything else, give me a shout. Love to the kids. Tell them I'll be out soon.'",
      "'Ooops, I got lipstick on your cheek.'",
      "'Leave it. I'm branded.'",
      "And away she flew, eager for what life had to offer.",
      "He had always started his Christmas list with the nurses. Who could make it without nurses? Not the doctors, not the patients. How many years had he spent plowing up the hill to visit the ever-changing stable of patients, assisted by nurses in his labors of consolation? Even the sour ones had their place in the scheme of things.",
      "And didn't nurses love chocolate? Wasn't that their favorite thing to go home to even if they had a husband who was good-looking and would carry out the garbage? But the rules had shifted when he wasn't looking. He'd been told that what nurses want now is gift certificates. Nurses want to choose their chocolate themselves.",
      "Good for nurses for speaking out and taking charge!",
      "Five gift certificates for chocolate. It felt good just getting that on paper. Unlike his free-ranging wife, he enjoyed the boundaries imposed by a list.",
      "He would save his wife 'til last on the list because she required more than a bit of head-scratching. 'Don't buy me anything,' she said just yesterday. 'I have everything I could possibly want or need. Just write me a love letter. Please, honey.'",
      "He loved it when she called him honey.",
      "He remembered the Year of the Bathrobe \u2013 he had searched for one-hundred-percent cotton with pockets \u2013 she favored pockets \u2013 and matching slippers. Though he was convinced he had a home run, she had seemed ... what? Dismayed wouldn't cover it.",
      "A more recent Christmas gift had its own downside. According to rule, they agreed to give each other one gift only \u2013 no cheating by giving more. It had to be utilitarian, and they had to keep mum so it would be a surprise. She liked surprises.",
      "They had ended up giving each other the same thing \u2013 a smoothie blender. The same make and model. Surprise all around! Hers, however, had been on sale and she had saved thirty bucks. Which meant that he'd be returning the one he bought. All he had to do was hike to the recycle bin in a freezing rain and retrieve the box and dig through the foam peanuts that went berserk all over the place and locate the shipping label and the form that asked why the item was being returned, to which he replied It's a long story, and then rewrap the blasted thing and schlep it to the UPS drop-off.",
      "Looking back, his own biggest want had once been for a world globe, and she had been thrilled to give him one. Years later \u2013 six or seven, maybe \u2013 he was still perfectly satisfied with his globe. Lighted. In a mahogany stand. How could he want more?",
      "'I'd love to give you something you'd really, deeply enjoy,' she said yesterday. 'Something that would make you feel, I don't know, seventeen again?'",
      "'I have her,' he said.",
      "She seemed to like that argument, but still ...",
      "Since they married, he'd written a love letter or two. The one in which he plagiarized a passage from Duff Cooper had been a hit. Cooper had enjoyed a career of writing torrid love letters to his wife, Diana, before dying at sea in '54. But the letter currently under consideration would have to come entirely from his own striving.",
      "Gus was awake and panting at his feet.",
      "The red leash that his hundred-and-ten-pound Bouvier had worn was of course too large for a rescue of thirty-three pounds soaking wet. He had punched a few holes and used his leather cutter to nip the excess.",
      "Out they went into the mountain fog.",
      "So far, November was an unseasonably warm month, not cold enough for a fire in the hearth. This weekend would be different; the temperature was predicted to drop by several degrees, and they had a half-cord of hardwood he was itching to burn.",
      "This was ground fog; those headed down the mountain would be driving the first few miles in a cloud. He was a fog fan. And no wonder \u2013 he was Irish. Gus also had a touch of the Irish. His dog was fond of music, had once lapped up a spilled Guinness at a Meadowgate party, and was inclined to good humor often resulting in a grin.",
      "He had believed grinning dogs merely a staple of YouTube, but now he had one of his own \u2013 who, by the way, could also bark with a ball in his mouth. He absolutely did not deserve such a talented dog.",
      "He spied Emma Newland barreling around the corner with Snickers, a twelve-year-old rescue. At this distance, he could not run nor could he hide from his former church secretary and personal Genghis Kahn. He zipped his jacket, turned up the collar, armored himself. He could tell by Gus's bark that his dog was not into this encounter; Gus had met Snickers on other occasions and was unimpressed.",
      "'Why don't you get another leash?' she yelled over the barking.",
      "'This leash is fine,' he yelled back.",
      "'Seems like it would remind you of you know who.'",
      "She had seldom called his former companion by name.",
      "'I like being reminded of Barnabas!' he shouted into the din.",
      "Snickers retreated behind his owner, growling, as Gus took leeway to sniff Emma's shoes. Black. Sturdy. Size ten. Triple A. She was proud of the triple A. As her former priest and so-called boss, he knew almost everything about this woman whose desk had sat less than three feet from his own. He had to hand it to her \u2013 Emma Newland could, in a heartbeat, make three feet feel like three inches.",
      "She gave him the eye, as if she'd caught him being naughty in some inconceivable way. 'What brings you out so early?'",
      "'Gus!' he said.",
      "Up ahead, the first squirrel of the morning. And away they went at a trot.",
      "He and Gus were blowing across the parking lot at Mitford School when he met Grace Murphy, speed-walking toward the school's front entrance. Blond hair in braids, bifocals firmly in place, a wide-open smile displaying a hatchwork of braces on wayward teeth. Grace was one of his favorite people.",
      "'Good morning, Father! And good morning, Gusarino.' She stooped, girded by a backpack of considerable size, to give his happy dog a head scratch.",
      "'We're glad to see you out brightening up the world,' he said.",
      "'I'm reading to our English class this morning. I'm sort of nervous!'",
      "'What are you reading?'",
      "'Willa Cather On Writing.'",
      "'Willa Cather? Remind me what grade you're in?'",
      "'Fifth because I skipped third,' she said. 'Next week, we'll be reading from Eudora Welty's book on writing. I'm co-teaching a whole American Literature unit with Miss Phillips. Got to go, Father! Bye, Gussie! Have a great day!'",
      "'The Lord be with you!' he called after her.",
      "'And also with you!' she called back. Grace was an acolyte at Lord's Chapel, wise in the ways of liturgical response.",
      "He felt the smile on his face, the way it softened his skin that was busy drinking clean mountain air.",
      "Two squirrels later, he was back in the kitchen, staring at The List.",
      "He was a dash fatigued from their walk. Supplying St. Mark's in Holding had been a mixed blessing. Full priestly duties June through October, combined with driving up and down the mountain, had been a stretch. In the five months of priesting a troubled parish, he had counted heavily on the prayer that never fails.",
      "Back to business.",
      "His mother had been the Christmas-list maker of all time \u2013 everything inscribed in a stenographer's notebook by July seventh, when she closed her gardens to the public. She set at once to the task of making pin cushions, pillowcases, embroidered dresser scarves, the occasional sweater or baby blanket, and stacks of tea towels and aprons from printed flour sacks.",
      "'Th' woman is an industry,' said his grandfather.",
      "She also used flour sacks to make his boxers for her mortified son. He could depend on the sight of them under the tree \u2013 a starched four-pack wrapped in white tissue and adorned with a holly sprig.",
      "He remembered hiding like a common thief when exchanging his britches for running shorts in the school locker room. He had nonetheless been spied in this covert maneuver, and the shamings were a memory he detested. He was fourteen when he finally wrangled store-bought from his mother, the family exchequer.",

    "summary": "The bestselling author had said she would no longer write novels set in the make-believe mountain village of Mitford. After the death of her daughter, she wrote through her grief \u2013 which led to her 15th Mitford book, \"My Beloved.\"",
    "story": [
      "For one weekend only, hundreds of devoted readers gathered in Hudson, North Carolina, to celebrate Mitford, a fictional place with a real sense of community. Jan Karon, the 88-year-old author behind Mitford, has written 15 books about the make-believe mountain village.",
      "Asked how to describe the town of Mitford, Karon said it is \"a place my readers can go and not be afraid. It's a place of refuge. It's where they can go, get a deep breath.\"",
      "The humanity of Karon's characters has found a faithful following that's perennially put her novels on the bestseller list. But for some people, she's not a household name like other bestselling authors. Asked why, Karon said, \"I don't give you much of a ride. I just give you sort of a float! A lot of people tell me that my books put them to sleep, and I consider that a huge compliment!\"",
      "Karon's super-fans say the books are more than page turners. According to Nellie McMasters, \"We are in such an uncertain period, we're in such turmoil, that it's just a nice, pleasant place.\"",
      "\"And it's not divisive,\" said Joellen Maurer. \"This is just love your neighbor, know the people who live around you.\"",
      "Asked if she believes places like Mitford exist in America today, Phyllis Farringer replied, \"They do, where there's a community of faith and people caring about each other, and I see it.\"",
      "Jan Karon was raised by her grandmother, Fannie, in Hudson, and attended elementary school there. Almost eight decades later, she converted the site to the Mitford Museum.",
      "She credits her first grade teacher Nan Downs with encouraging her creativity. By age 10, Karon says, she knew she wanted to be a writer: \"I stood in front of this very mirror, and I said, I'm going to be an author.\"",
      "How did she know? \"I just knew,\" Karon said. \"I love to read. And so, I wanted to give other people what I received from reading, which was that whole other world.\"",
      "At 14, Karon found herself wanting to escape her world, so she got married, dropped out of school, and gave birth to her daughter, Candace, a year later. She was divorced at 18.",
      "\"A lot of it was really hard, because I became a single mom and had to raise her by myself when I myself had hardly been raised,\" she said.",
      "She worked a series of jobs, including TV producer. She was later fired, and says that was her turning point: \"It brought me to my knees; I'd never been on my knees,\" Karon said. \"I was 42. I just went down: I don't know what to pray for. I'm just here, and I need help and just change me.\"",
      "She became a successful advertising executive, but says she felt called to write more than ads. So, she quit her job, and began weaving her faith into her short stories. She published her work for free in a local newspaper, eventually turning those tales into her first Mitford novel, \"At Home in Mitford,\" in 1994.",
      "I asked, \"I think that when people think about your books and your work, they often think comforting, they think maybe clean, Christian.\"",
      "\"I'm grateful for my Christian readers, very grateful,\" Karon said. \"But I write for a secular audience. God poured his love into me, and you can't say, well, I just can't talk about that in my books.\"",
      "Her latest Mitford work, \"My Beloved,\" is all about presence, aging, and connection. Karon says it was one of the most challenging things she's ever written \u2013 and comes after having said she would never write another Mitford book.",
      "In 2008, she began a short story set during Christmas, but it sat unfinished for more than a decade. In 2021, her daughter, Candace, died of cancer. Karon was moved to write through her grief. The finished work, now a novel, is dedicated to her daughter,",
      "\"She was the sunshine of my life,\" Karon said of Candace.",
      "I asked, \"Do you ever talk to her while you're sitting here writing?\"",
      "\"All the time,\" she replied. \"And I know this sounds corny, but it's true for me, right here, she'll say, 'I hear you, Mom. It's okay, Mom. Everything's gonna be all right.'\"",
      "\"How did losing Candace change your life?\"",
      "\"I'm less judgmental,\" Karon replied. \"I'm a little easier, even on myself. And I've always been really hard on myself. I know that we don't have forever anymore, which is a thing in this book. So, what can we do with this time? Something better than what we're doing? Or even just something more fun? We don't have to be noble all the time.\"",
      "Jan Karon invites us to look for community and neighborly love, to find our own kind of Mitford. \"If you will just get in your car and drive out into America, I'm telling you, I can guarantee, I promise you, that it is out there. You have to look for it. It's not going to come to you and sit on your doorstep. You've got to go out and get it, and it's there for the taking.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 09:18:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

      "Prominent American playwright and actor, Jeremy O. Harris, known for his Tony-nominated \"Slave Play\" and his role in the Netflix series \"Emily in Paris,\" was arrested in Japan on suspicion of smuggling the psychedelic drug ecstasy, officials said Saturday.",
      "Officers at Naha Airport on Japan's southern island of Okinawa arrested Harris on Nov. 16 for an alleged violation of customs law for having 0.78 grams, or 0.0275 ounces, of the crystalized drug, also known as MDMA, in a container in a tote bag he was carrying, according to Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson Tatsunori Fukuda.",
      "Harris, 36, had left London's Heathrow Airport two days earlier and transited in Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport before arriving in Naha for sightseeing, Fukuda said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination with mild weather throughout the year.",
      "Fukuda said Harris was arrested on the spot and taken into custody by the Tomishiro police, which filed a criminal complaint to the Naha District Prosecutors' Office on Thursday for further investigation and possible indictment. CBS News has reached out to the Tomishiro police for additional comment.",
      "Japanese authorities did not find any other drugs in his luggage and believe the MDMA was for his personal use. They are still investigating, Fukuda said, while adding that whether Harris made any comment on the case could not be released.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Harris' representatives. Harris has not publicly commented on his arrest.",
      "CBS News reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Japan for additional comment.",
      "Japanese criminal procedures allow investigators to keep a suspect in custody for up to 23 days before indictment, and pretrial detention can be prolonged if the accused exercises their right of silence or denies the charges, a practice widely criticized as \"hostage justice.\"",
      "Those convicted of drug smuggling in Japan can face a multiyear prison term.",
      "Harris burst onto the arts scene with \"Slave Play,\" written while he was still a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama. It premiered off-Broadway in 2018, inciting controversy and even a petition to shut down the production with its provocative mix of race, class and sexual taboos. It moved to Broadway the following year, earning a Tony nomination for best play, but did not win an award.",
      "The play returned for a short run on Broadway in December 2021.",
      "\"There haven't been enough chances for us to reflect who we are to the world and to ourselves and to ponder what that reflection means, and so this is what 'Slave Play' gets to do for people,\" Harris told CBS New York in 2021.",

    "summary": "President Trump presented medals to the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees during an Oval Office ceremony.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Center Honors program and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts center for broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+. Mr. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump.",
      "The president said in August that he had agreed to host the show, and he seemed to confirm on Saturday that he would do so, predicting that the broadcast would garner its highest ratings ever as a result. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honorees in the audience. None has ever served as host.",
      "He said he looked forward to Sunday's celebration.",
      "\"It's going to be something that I believe, and I'm going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's going to happen tomorrow night,\" Mr. Trump said.",

    "story": [
      "Nardiz Cooke was alarmed when she felt a lump in her right breast in late 2018. Her OB-GYN wasn't: Cooke was 38 and had no family history of cancer. Cooke's doctor diagnosed her with fibrosis, a common condition that causes tissue to feel lumpy.",
      "Cooke was reassured, but almost two years later, new symptoms began. She had splitting headaches. She said she was \"vomiting out of the blue.\" Her ears rang. She had double vision and sometimes lost her sight. Once, it took 40 minutes for her vision to return.",
      "But no matter how many doctors Cooke saw, everything came back clear. In October 2021, she went to the emergency room and refused to leave without an answer.",
      "\"After several exams, again, my sight, ears, everything you can imagine, the doctor said, 'You're fine.' I said, 'Doctor, I'm not fine,'\" Cooke recalled.",
      "The doctor ordered an MRI. It showed she had aggressive cancer. Soon after, she was given an official diagnosis: Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her brain.",
      "\"It made sense, something about those words \u2014 that was the path that felt right,\" Cooke said.",
      "As she learned about her options, Cooke said she didn't want to focus on worst-case scenarios.",
      "\"It felt like, well, Nardiz, here you go. This is your fate. What are you going to do with it?\"",
      "Focusing on a \"trophy\"",
      "Cooke let herself be swept along the \"pink carpet\" of breast cancer treatment. People who are initially diagnosed with Stage IV cancer often have a poorer prognosis than someone who is diagnosed with earlier-stage disease that grows, said Dr. Carmen Calfa, Cooke's medical oncologist at the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Medical advancements and tailored therapies can extend a patient's lifespan, Calfa said, but treatment is lifelong.",
      "Radiation oncologist Dr. Jessica Meshman targeted the tumors in Cooke's brain with radiation therapy. On her first day of treatment, Cooke was intrigued by the custom-fit thermoplastic mask that would direct radiation beams and protect healthy tissue.",
      "\"I saw that thing, that mask, and I said, 'I cannot wait to be done with these treatments, because I'm going to take my mask home, as a symbol, like it's my trophy,\" Cooke said.",
      "Cooke received multiple forms of radiation over two years. When she was feeling claustrophobic inside the spaceship-like machine that delivered the treatment or feeling fatigued and achy at home, she thought about what she would do with the mask when it was no longer needed.",
      "\"This amazing symbol of strength\"",
      "Cooke had her final radiation treatment in late 2022. She had two masks. Several months after finishing treatment, she splurged on quartz crystals.",
      "\"I had no idea. I had no money, but I just bought all these crystals,\" Cooke said. \"I found myself just draping (the mask), adorning (it) in quartz.\"",
      "Cooke thought the glittering results looked like something from a movie or a dream. The next time Cooke met with Meshman, she showed the doctor her photos of the mask. Meshman reached out to administrators at the cancer center to see if Cooke's mask could be displayed there. It was put in the lobby this autumn.",
      "\"I just thought it would be so incredible for other patients to see kind of the strength that she has through the piece,\" Meshman said. \"She took something that can be quite terrifying and made it this amazing symbol of strength.\"",
      "Cooke's project grew as other patients began anonymously donating their masks. She named the collection \"Radiant Sentinels.\" Each mask was a fresh canvas.",
      "\"I have learned so much from each mask, because each mask is a different material, and I research the materials, and they take me to stories, to knowledge. It's very, very interesting,\" Cooke said. \"And I respect the process very much, because that mask, the person that donated that mask, doesn't even know. But I respect them and I wish them the best.\"",
      "\"Never thought of doing something like this\"",
      "Four years after her diagnosis, Cooke, 44, is \"doing amazing,\" Meshman said. Calfa said Cooke is \"blossoming\" and that her ongoing hormone therapy treatment is going well.",
      "Cooke said she follows a four-step regimen: Taking her medication, going to her regular appointments with Calfa and Meshman, working on \"Radiant Sentinels,\" and enjoying a regular glass of red wine.",
      "Cooke's pieces were shown at a Miami gallery on Thursday. Twelve masks \u2014 two of Cooke's and 10 from donors \u2014 were showcased. Calfa and Meshman both attended.",
      "One mask shines with thousands of mirrored glass shards, while another is inspired by a tribal dance from Cooke's hometown in northern Mexico and adorned with naturally shed deer antlers. Another is studded with thousands of tiny religious figures called milagritos.",
      "Other masks are coated in fish scales and seashells. One resembled a knight's helmet wrought with leaves.",
      "Seeing all of the masks gathered and on display was momentous, said Cooke, who comes from a family of artists, but this was her first such effort.",
      "\"I would have never thought of doing something like this with my hands,\" Cooke said. \"I don't have to tell anybody how to feel when they see this. It's their own reflection, their own sight. I am just handing them a candle for them to have their experience with a mask, one-on-one.\"",
      "Cooke said she is continuing to solicit donated masks and will continue to add to the \"Radiant Sentinels\" collection. Cancer changed what she thought her life would look like, but she said it also gave her a new purpose.",
      "\"I'm 44, and I went into full menopause at 40,\" Cooke said. \"That was difficult, but I just gave in. That made a lot of the decisions for me. I did not have any kids. I realized, 'You're not here to have kids. You're here to be an auntie, and you're here to make 'Radiant Sentinels.'\"",

      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",
      "A streaming app to rule them all?",
      "In a conference call with investors to discuss the acquisition, Netflix executives said the deal will help the company attract more subscribers, while also creating value for shareholders.",
      "\"We expect to attract and maintain more subscribers, and drive incremental revenue and operating income,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the call.\u00a0 \"We think it'll accelerate our business for decades to come.\"",
      "Peters was also questioned about his comments at an October conference, when he said that big media mergers \"don't have an amazing track record.\" On Friday, the executive said he believed this merger would prove to be different because of Netflix's expertise in creating content.",
      "\"A lot of those failures [are] because the company doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" he said. \"We understand the business.\"",
      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",
      "\"The rationale for such a deal stems from merging two overlapping streaming offers into a single flagship Netflix app or a tight Netflix-HBO Max bundle, with one login, one discovery layer and one advertising system,\" MKI said.",
      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films. Yet the streaming giant could face regulatory hurdles in seeking to complete the deal amid concerns the transaction could weaken competition among theaters, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",
      "Some lawmakers on Friday also raised concerns that Netflix's dominance in streaming could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Allowing Netflix to buy Warner Bros. and control access to almost half of streaming subscribers means it could get more expensive to watch your favorite movies and shows,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said on social media.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros., whose stock price has more than doubled since this summer as speculation of a possible deal heated up, gained $1.54, or 6.3%, to close the day at $26.08. Netflix shares fell $2.98, or 2.9%, to $100.24.",

    "story": [
      "Frank Gehry, the renowned architect who was known for designing the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, has died, a representative confirmed to CBS News. He was 96.",
      "Gehry died Friday in his home in Santa Monica, California, after a brief respiratory illness, Meaghan Lloyd, his chief of staff at Gehry Partners LLP, told CBS News in an email.",
      "He won every major prize that architecture has to offer, including the field's top honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, for what has been described as \"refreshingly original and totally American\" work.",
      "Gehry's fascination with modern pop art led to the creation of some of the most wildly imaginative buildings ever constructed and brought him a measure of worldwide acclaim seldom afforded any architect.",
      "In addition to Spain's Guggenheim Museum and LA's Walt Disney Concert Hall, his many masterpieces include Berlin's DZ Bank Building and an expansion of Facebook's Northern California headquarters at the insistence of the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. He also designed the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park and the BP Pedestrian Bridge, which connects Millennium Park to Maggie Daley Park.",
      "Other honors include the Royal Institute of British Architects gold medal, the Americans for the Arts lifetime achievement award and his native country's highest honor, the Companion of the Order of Canada.",
      "Years after he stopped designing ordinary looking buildings, word surfaced in 2006 that the pedestrian Santa Monica mall project that had led to his career epiphany might be headed for the wrecking ball. Gehry admirers were aghast, but the man himself was amused.",
      "\"They're going to tear it down now and build the kind of original idea I had,\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Eventually the mall was remodeled, giving it a more contemporary, airy outdoor look. Still, it's no Gehry masterpiece.",
      "Gehry, meanwhile, continued to work well into his 80s, turning out heralded buildings that remade skylines around the world.",
      "The headquarters of the InterActiveCorp, known as the IAC Building, took the shape of a shimmering beehive when it was completed in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood in 2007. The 76-story New York by Gehry building, once one of the world's tallest residential structures, was a stunning addition to the lower Manhattan skyline when it opened in 2011.",
      "That same year, Gehry joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Southern California, as a professor of architecture. He also taught at Yale and Columbia University.",
      "Not everyone was a fan of Gehry's work. Some naysayers dismissed it as not much more than gigantic, lopsided reincarnations of the little scrap-wood cities he said he spent hours building when he was growing up in the mining town of Timmins, Ontario.",
      "Princeton art critic Hal Foster dismissed many of his later efforts as \"oppressive,\" arguing they were designed primarily to be tourist attractions. Some denounced the Disney Hall as looking like a collection of cardboard boxes that had been left out in the rain.",
      "Still other critics included Dwight D. Eisenhower's family, who objected to Gehry's bold proposal for a memorial to honor the nation's 34th president. Although the family said it wanted a simple memorial and not the one Gehry had proposed, with its multiple statues and billowing metal tapestries depicting Eisenhower's life, the architect declined to change his design significantly.",
      "If the words of his critics annoyed Gehry, he rarely let on. Indeed, he even sometimes played along. He appeared as himself in a 2005 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" in which he agreed to design a concert hall that was later converted into a prison.",
      "He came up with the idea for the design, which looked a lot like the Disney Hall, after crumpling Marge Simpson's letter to him and throwing it on the ground. After taking a look at it, he declared, \"Frank Gehry, you've done it again!\"",
      "\"Some people think I actually do that,\" he would later tell The AP.",
      "Ephraim Owen Goldberg was born in Toronto on Feb. 28, 1929, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1947, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. As an adult, he changed his name at the suggestion of his first wife, who told him antisemitism might be holding back his career.",
      "Although he had enjoyed drawing and building model cities as a child, Gehry said it wasn't until he was 20 that he pondered the possibility of pursuing a career in architecture, after a college ceramics teacher recognized his talent.",
      "\"It was like the first thing in my life that I'd done well in,\" he said.",
      "He went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954. After serving in the Army, he studied urban planning at Harvard University.",
      "His survivors include his wife, Berta; daughter, Brina; sons Alejandro and Samuel; and the buildings he created.",
      "Another daughter, Leslie Gehry Brenner, died of cancer in 2008.",

    "story": [
      "Steve Cropper, the lean, soulful guitarist and songwriter who helped anchor the celebrated Memphis backing band Booker T. and the M.G.'s at Stax Records and co-wrote the classics \"Green Onions,\" \"(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay\" and \"In the Midnight Hour,\" has died. He was 84.",
      "Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, confirmed Cropper's death to CBS News. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore told The Associated Press he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.",
      "\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"",
      "\"Steve was a beloved musician, songwriter, and producer whose extraordinary talent touched the lives of millions worldwide,\" Cropper's family said in a statement released through the foundation, describing his \"influence on American music is immeasurable.\"",
      "\"Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensure that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come,\" the family wrote.",
      "The guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.",
      "Cropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists",
      "Cropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"",
      "In a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.",
      "\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.",
      "\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"",
      "Satellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.",
      "Cropper co-wrote \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" weeks before Redding's death",
      "In a 2017 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Cropper recounted playing guitar behind Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival in a legendary 1967 performance that helped put Redding on the map.",
      "\"We had no idea what the reaction was gonna be. And it was unbelievable,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "In late November of 1967, Cropper said Redding brought him a song the now-legendary singer had started writing on a houseboat overlooking San Francisco Bay that would become \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.\"",
      "\"That afternoon, it was done,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We went and cut it the next day. I think there's three takes of it.\"",
      "A few weeks later, on Dec. 10, 1967, Redding died in a small plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin, at the age of 26.",
      "\"And I said, 'I just lost my best friend,'\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Cropper returned to the studio to put the finishing touches on the song, and \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" released in January 1968, became the first posthumous No. 1 record on the Billboard charts. It won Redding and Cropper the Grammy for Best R&B song, with Redding also winning Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. broke barriers",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. was a racially integrated band, a rarity in its day. It was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.",
      "\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \"I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\"The man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\" he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. That year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones played in an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan. Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \"the secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\"",
      "Cropper was in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\" and its follow-up, \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" portraying \"The Colonel\" in the Blues Brothers band. In real life, he toured with them.",
      "He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, and two years later received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "Cropper continued recording into his later years, including 2024's \"Friendlytown,\" which was nominated for a Grammy. Earlier this year, Cropper received the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award, the state's highest honor in the arts.",

    "story": [
      "An urgent advisory warning people against eating foraged mushrooms was issued by the California Department of Public Health on Friday due to recent amatoxin poisonings.",
      "As of Friday, there were 21 poisonings confirmed by the California Poison Control System linked to eating wild, foraged mushrooms, such as death caps, the CDPH said.",
      "One case resulted in death, and several other patients, including children and adults, have suffered severe liver damage, the CDPH said. A liver transplant may even be needed for at least one of the patients.",
      "The CDPH said the poisonings were reported in clusters in the Monterey area and Bay Area. However, the risk of poisoning is statewide as rain during the fall and winter months creates beneficial growth conditions for death caps.",
      "They can typically be found near oaks and other hardwood trees, including pine trees, and are easily mistaken for safe, edible mushrooms. But neither cooking, boiling, drying or freezing them will render them safe to eat, the CDPH said.",
      "Symptoms such as watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration can begin between six to 24 hours after eating one, and it's possible symptoms will go away after a day, but the CDPH warns the recovery is \"deceptive.\"",
      "\"Patients may still develop serious to fatal liver damage within 48 to 96 hours after eating the mushrooms,\" the CDPH said.",
      "\"Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season,\" said Dr. Erica Pan, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer.",
      "The CDPH advises people to buy mushrooms from reputable stores or known commercial sources.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nucleus-genomics-ceo-genetic-optimization-tools-parents-select-traits-babies/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation is waiving part of a fine assessed against Southwest Airlines after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022.",
      "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty. The government said at the time that the penalty was the largest it had ever imposed on an airline for violating consumer protection laws.",
      "Most of the money went toward compensation for travelers. But Southwest agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S. Treasury. Southwest made a $12 million payment in 2024 and a second $12 million payment earlier this year. But the Transportation Department issued an order Friday waiving the final $11 million payment, which was due Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "The department said Southwest should get credit for significantly improving its on-time performance and investing in network operations.",
      "\"DOT believes that this approach is in the public interest as it incentivizes airlines to invest in improving their operations and resiliency, which benefits consumers directly,\" the department said in a statement. \"This credit structure allows for the benefits of the airline's investment to be realized by the public, rather than resulting in a government monetary penalty.\"",
      "The fine stemmed from a winter storm in December 2022 that paralyzed Southwest's operations in Denver and Chicago and then snowballed when a crew-rescheduling system couldn't keep up with the chaos. Ultimately the airline canceled 17,000 flights and stranded more than 2 million travelers.",
      "The Biden administration determined that Southwest had violated the law by failing to help customers who were stranded in airports and hotels, leaving many of them to scramble for other flights. Many who called the airline's overwhelmed customer service center got busy signals or were stuck on hold for hours.",
      "Even before the settlement, the nation's fourth-biggest airline by revenue said the meltdown cost it more than $1.1 billion in refunds and reimbursements, extra costs and lost ticket sales over several months.",

    "summary": "Netflix on Friday said it will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO.",
    "story": [
      "Netflix on Friday said it is buying Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, merging the biggest streaming service with a storied studio that has produced films such as \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.",
      "In a statement, Netflix said the deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Netflix said it will buy Warner Bros. for $27.75 per share, giving the deal an equity value of $72 billion and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months, Netflix said.",
      "The agreement comes after Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of Warner, had announced in June that it planned to split in two, dividing its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports from its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television.",
      "But in October, Warner Bros. Discovery said it had attracted interest from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News) and Comcast Corp., were also pursuing a deal for Warner Bros.",
      "According to media reports, Paramount Skydance was interested in acquiring all of Warner Bros., including its cable assets such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "Why Netflix wants Warner Bros.",
      "Buying Warner Bros.' studios would mark a major strategic shift for Netflix, experts said. Although Netflix already produces original programming, including hit shows such as \"Stranger Things,\" the acquisition would boost its ability to create content, while also giving it control of Warner Bros.' 102-year-old catalogue, analysts noted.",
      "Netflix \"will cement itself as the Goliath of streaming,\" said Mike Proulx, a vice president of research at Forrester. \"This deal changes the calculus of the streaming wars, representing a seismic shift in the entertainment industry.\"",
      "The enlarged company's greater scale could also help Netflix in negotiating with advertisers and partners, market research firm MKI Global said in a report. Adding Warner Bros.' studio and streaming business would give Netflix \"a larger flow of premium films and series, reduces hit-rate risk and gives the combined group firmer control over how each title earns through its cycle,\" the market research firm added.",
      "The deal also comes as Netflix competes with streaming rival YouTube, which is growing at a faster pace, according to Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.",
      "\"Ultimately, investors need to assess whether Netflix is making this deal in a 'rare opportunity' to accelerate its growth or if it is truly more of a defensive move to limit its peers from getting stronger and increasing competition,\" analysts with MoffettNathanson Research, an investment advisory firm focused on tech, telecom and media, said in a research note.",

      "Analysts said Netflix would benefit by adding Warner Bros.' extensive streaming and film content.",

      "Potential regulatory hurdles",
      "Under the proposed deal, Netflix pledged to honor any contractual agreements for releasing Warner Bros.' studio films.

      "\"Significant concerns have been voiced over the potential impact to the theatrical market should Netflix take over [Warner Bros.],\" analysts with Wedbush Securities said in a note to investors, adding that \"concerns remain within the industry and among government officials\" about the impact of such a deal.",

      "Federal regulators said they are expanding an investigation into Waymo this week, following reports that the company's self-driving cars\u00a0navigated around school buses stopped on the road in Austin, Texas.",
      "In a letter to Waymo dated Dec. 3, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will investigate the performance of the autonomous vehicles and their ability to follow traffic safety laws.\u00a0Reuters\u00a0first reported the news.",
      "The Austin Independent School District told CBS News it is now aware of 20 incidents this school year in which a Waymo vehicle illegally passed a school bus. All 50 U.S. states have laws requiring vehicles to halt for a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop-arm signal,\u00a0according to the NHTSA.",
      "Waymo said it identified the software issue that contributed to the school bus incidents and that it implemented updates by Nov. 17, which it said improved its vehicles' performance. The company is also planning to issue a voluntary software recall with NHTSA next week, Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, chief safety officer at Waymo, told CBS News late Friday.",
      "\"We will continue analyzing our vehicles' performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement,\" said Pe\u00f1a.",
      "Local officials in Austin say they remain concerned about road safety.",
      "\"As of Dec. 1, 2025, Waymo received its 20th citation since the beginning of the school year,\" JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the Austin Independent School District, told CBS News. \"This is after the company said it had fixed the issue through software updates that were implemented on Nov. 17.\"",
      "In a Nov. 20\u00a0letter\u00a0to Waymo, the school district called on the robotaxi company to cease operations within the school district during the hours when students are loading and unloading from school buses until software updates are completed and Waymo can guarantee its vehicles will comply with the law.",
      "Maldonado said the company \"refused to cease operations\" during the hours the school district had requested.",
      "In response to a request for comment about the NHTSA probe, Waymo pointed to its overall safety record.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority, and the data shows we are improving road safety in the communities in which we operate, achieving a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians,\" a Waymo spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Waymo did not comment on its response to the Austin school district's request to suspend service when students are getting on and off buses.",
      "In October, NHTSA launched a probe into the company after an incident in Atlanta, Georgia, in which a Waymo vehicle drove around a stopped school bus with flashing red lights and its stop arm deployed.",
      "While maneuvering around the bus, NHTSA said the vehicle passed the bus' stop arm and a safety device that swings out from the bus close to where students were disembarking. At the time of the incident, no safety operator was present in the self-driving vehicle, according to the NHTSA.",
      "Atlanta Public Schools, a school district, told CBS Atlanta they are aware of six cases where Waymo cars illegally passed stopped school buses.",
      "Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, first started offering its fully autonomous vehicle service to the public in October 2020 in Phoenix. The company now offers hundreds of thousands of driverless rides each week in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix and Atlanta.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 17:01:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"It's very discouraging,\" said one young job-seeker as employers pull back on hiring entry-level workers.",
    "story": [
      "Angel Escobedo started looking for work a year and a half ago, even before completing his college degree at Saint Xavier University in Chicago. Now, with less than a week to go before graduation and having applied to more than 150 jobs, he's still searching.",
      "Escobedo's predicament illustrates the challenges that many young Americans, even those with impressive academic records, are having entering the nation's workforce amid a broad decline in job listings and as they compete with more experienced people.",
      "\"They're sort of missing out on the ability to jump into the labor market,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. \"It's not a new phenomenon, but it is a concerning phenomenon.\"",
      "For young adults eager to start their careers, the obstacles can seem daunting. Escobedo, 22, has had multiple professional internships during his college career and also completed a management training program at Harvard Business School. The Illinois resident, who is seeking a job in finance or business operations, said he has found the job search process \"very discouraging,\" noting that he's open to just about any kind of employment.",
      "Gen Z job applicants, like other workers, are also having to navigate a quickly changing job-hunting landscape in which employers increasingly use AI and self-recorded video interviews to screen candidates. Job seekers told CBS News that while it's easy to apply for work, finding ways to stand out is hard, while the new tech adds a new layer of complexity.",
      "Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and University of California, Berkeley, faculty member, said the stakes for Gen Z are high. If they can't get the right experience early on, they could struggle to catch up professionally and financially.",
      "\"If the pool of entry-level opportunities continues to dry up, then it's going to be ever more challenging for this generation to show certain brand names, certain job titles and certain bullet points on their resumes, which is only going to make that next job more challenging to get,\" he said.",
      "Slowdown in hiring",
      "Getting your foot in the door has always been tougher for young workers, and current labor market conditions aren't making it any easier. The overall hiring rate, which has been declining since 2022, has fallen to just over 3%, below its historical average, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Hiring is muted due to uncertainty about the U.S. economy, including the government policy environment and tariffs, Gould told CBS News. \"There's this sort of sitting tight for employers and for workers right now, not wanting to make any sudden moves because of the uncertainty,\" she said.",
      "The nation's overall unemployment rate in September was 4.4% \u2014 less than half the 9.2% rate for 20- to 24-year-olds, according to government labor figures.",
      "Even when early-career employees succeed in landing a coveted position, they may face barriers climbing the ladder. That's because, with more seasoned employees often staying put these days because of economic uncertainty and as employment turnover slows, Gen Zers have fewer opportunities to switch jobs \u2014 a common route to gaining more responsibilities and higher pay.",
      "\"Your salary is all about growing or negotiating leverage,\" Ng said. \"And so when you look for another position, one of the easiest ways to ask for more money is to have made more money in the past.\"",
      "Alan Gonzalez, a 23-year-old resident of Malden, Mass., said he'd be willing to take a lower-paying job in his field just to kick-start his career. Since graduating from UMass Boston in May, he has been working as a restaurant server while looking for a position in digital marketing.",
      "\"Despite having a lot of internship experience and real-world practical experience that I can apply, including my degree, it has still been very difficult to even get an interview opportunity,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Eager to exercise his creativity but without any job offers in hand, Gonzalez has also started his own clothing brand, HOJA Apparel, which he describes as a \"lifestyle streetwear meets streetwear hybrid\" focused on high-quality and design. He's working to grow his social media presence to promote the brand, with an official clothing drop planned for next year.",
      "\"Right now, the priority is experience,\" Gonzalez said.",
      "Some industries pose their own challenges when Gen Z job-hunters come knocking. For example, employers in fields such as accounting, engineering and technology typically have fewer job openings for junior employees than senior-level roles, according to data from career services firm Indeed.",
      "\"It has become progressively harder for almost anyone to secure jobs in those areas, and this is especially true for younger workers,\" Cory Stahle, senior economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email. \"Fewer opportunities also mean that entry-level workers are becoming more likely to compete against an increasing number of mid- or senior-level workers in the process as well.\"",
      "As of October, an average of around 30% of software development jobs listed on Indeed were for positions with senior titles, versus around 2% for roles with junior titles. Similar discrepancies exist for data analysis and tech positions.",
      "Many of the challenges of finding work are not unique to members of Gen Z, of course. Technology has long made it easier for people to submit a job application. But the latest technologies are also upping the competitive ante, according to Ng.",
      "\"AI and tech tools have made it easier to apply for internships,\" he said. \"But whenever something gets easier, the bar only gets higher, and the job application is really no different.\"",
      "Ng advises job candidates to get back to basics. That means trying to build relationships with potential employers, starting their job search early and making a concerted effort to get in front of a company's decision-makers.",
      "Escobedo said he's now putting an emphasis on old-school networking to get employers' attention. \"I've told my peers, the whole thing that it takes a village to raise a child, now it takes a village to get a college student a full-time role.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:56:46 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",

      "For example, in New Jersey, the wage floor for long-term care workers will rise to $18.92 an hour. New York City, Long Island and Westchester will all increase their baseline pay to $17 an hour.",
      "In some cases, minimum wage changes will be based on the size of the employer. For instance, large employers in Hayward, California \u2014 a city near San Francisco \u2014 will be required to pay workers a minimum of $17.79 an hour, although the figure for small establishments is $16.90.",
      "In Novato, California, another city in the Bay Area, the wage floor will increase according to employer size. For very large employers, or those with more than 100 workers, the minimum wage will rise to $17.73 an hour. Large employers, or those with 26 to 99 employees, will see a baseline pay of $17.46. Small employers, or those with 25 or fewer workers, will have a minimum wage of $16.90.",
      "Cost-of-living adjustments, raises designed to help workers' pay keep up with inflation, are driving minimum wage increases in 13 states and 44 cities and counties across the U.S., according to the NELP report.",
      "\"In the face of federal inaction, these raises are indexed to inflation, so they match the cost of living,\" NELP researcher Tsedeye Gebreselassie told CBS News.",
      "She noted that several increases have been driven by worker-led organizing, kicked off by the Fight for $15, a national movement for better pay and working conditions, which began in 2012.",
      "Some localities continue to have a $7.25 minimum wage. Many of them are in southern U.S. states.",
      "\"The contrast between states and cities that are raising wages every year and those that are stuck at $7.25 is really jarring,\" Gebreselassie said. \"On the one hand, the lack of affordability is about things costing too much, but on the other hand, it means people are not earning enough money to buy things.\"",
      "She added, \"There is a lot of talk about the former, but we need to make sure we are not losing sight of the fact that workers' wages need to go up.\"",

      "European Union regulators on Friday said it is fining Elon Musk's social media platform X $140 million (120 million euros) for violating regulations aimed at protecting internet users in the trading bloc from digital abuses.",
      "The European Commission said that X breached \"transparency obligations\" under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The fine represents the EU's first move to sanction a company for violating the law since the law was enacted in 2022.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr took issue with the fine and defended X. \"Once again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\" he\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0Friday in a post shared by X owner Elon Musk.",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "The 23rd Russia-India Summit comes at a pivotal moment as the U.S. pushes for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. It will test New Delhi's efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "Putin was received by Modi at an airport in New Delhi on Thursday. The Indian leader gave Putin a bear hug and a tight handshake with the gusto of an old friend.",
      "After the talks, Putin and Modi announced that India and Russia have finalized an economic cooperation program until 2030, which will help diversify mutual businesses to boost annual trade to $100 billion by 2030. They also emphasized strong energy ties.",
      "Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $68.7 billion in the last fiscal year ended March. The trade is heavily skewed in favor of Russia with deep deficits for India, which it is looking to bridge by pushing exports.",
      "\"To achieve this significant goal, a program for the development of Russian-Indian economic cooperation until 2030 has been agreed upon,\" Putin said. He said work is underway on an agreement for India to establish a free trade zone with the Eurasian Economic Union, a Moscow-dominated economic grouping of several ex-Soviet nations, adding that it could help increase trade.",
      "\"Russia is a reliable supplier of energy resources and everything necessary for the development of India's energy sector,\" Putin said. \"We are ready to continue ensuring the uninterrupted supply of fuel for the rapidly growing Indian economy.\"",
      "Before the summit talks, the Russian leader said the two countries \"have a very trusting relationship when it comes to military-technical cooperation.\"",
      "Modi, for his part, said after the talks that the two countries will work toward early conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. He also announced that India will soon start issuing free electronic visas for Russian tourists and groups visiting the country.",
      "The Indian leader said energy security has long anchored India-Russia ties, with civil nuclear cooperation spanning decades. He added that such cooperation will continue, alongside collaboration in clean energy, shipbuilding, fertilizers and labor mobility.",

      "The U.S. says purchases of Russian oil help finance Moscow's war machine. In October, the U.S. sanctioned two of Moscow's biggest oil producers to force countries like India to cut down on imports. Indian officials have said New Delhi has always abided by international sanctions and would do so in the case of Russia oil purchases as well.",

The Treasury said about a month later that they were having the desired impact, with nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil coming forward to say they would pause purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December.",
      "India and the U.S. set a target for the first tranche of a trade deal by the fall, but the deal hasn't come through yet amid strains in relations.

      "Indian officials earlier said that Modi in the meeting with Putin would push for faster delivery of two further Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. It has already received three under a 2018 deal worth about $5.4 billion. The delay has been tied to supply chain disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine.",
      "The two sides signed a pact in February to improve military cooperation, exercises, port calls, disaster relief assistance and logistics support. Moscow's State Duma ratified the same ahead of Putin's India visit.",

    "summary": "Rents in the 50 largest cities have surged by hundreds of dollars per month over the last five years, a LendingTree analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "If buying a home today is\u00a0financially out of reach\u00a0for many Americans, affording the rent may also seem like an increasingly tall order.",
      "In the 50 largest U.S. cities, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment climbed an average of $457 per month, or 41%, to $1,578\u00a0between 2020 and 2025, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0from loan marketplace LendingTree. Two-bedroom rents have surged an average of $505, or 37%, to roughly $1,858 per month over the same period.",
      "Since 2019, rents nationally have risen\u00a01.5 times faster than wages on average, according to a 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from online real estate brokers Zillow and StreetEasy.",
      "\"If your income is rising at the same time your rent is, maybe that extra expense is no big deal,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in the report. \"However, so many Americans' financial wiggle room is tiny, even in the best of times, so having to carve out hundreds of extra dollars to pay rent each month can be a big deal.\"",
      "Several factors explain why rents have surged, said Rob Bhatt, a consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. Perhaps most importantly, during the pandemic legions of newly remote workers moved to new markets, driving up rent\u00a0and housing prices.",
      "\"All the things that we saw during the pandemic have created stresses on the system, including stresses in these markets that traditionally haven't been renters' markets, and so it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust,\" he told CBS News.",
      "High home prices and rising mortgage rates, which have kept a lid on the number of homes coming to market, have also left more renters competing for a limited stock of affordable housing. Rents are projected to ease nationally next year, but only by 1%, according to a recent study from Realtor.com.",
      "Where have rents risen the most?",
      "New York, San Diego and Miami have seen the largest monthly rental increases for both one-bedroom units \u2014 which rose $854, $817 and $764 in the three cities, respectively, since 2020 \u2014 and two-bedroom units, which have jumped $857, $877 and $885, respectively, over the last five years.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 cities where one-bedroom rents have risen the most over the last five years, according to LendingTree (see chart below for a listing of the change in rents for the top 50 cities):",

      "Atlanta",
      "Orlando, Fla.",
      "Boston",
      "Phoenix",
      "In New York and San Diego, the spike in rents is attributable mostly to the demand for housing exceeding supply, according to LendingTree. Renters in those metro areas face limited inventory and plenty of competition.",
      "LendingTree attributed the surge in rental prices in Miami to the local population boom, noting that strong domestic and international migration to the area has driven up demand.",
      "One high-priced city where rent increases have cooled is San Francisco. The cost of a one-bedroom unit in the city rose $54 a month, to an average of $2,977, over the last five years, while two-bedrooms rose $51 to $3,604, LendingTree found.",
      "Other cities where rents are growing more slowly are Birmingham, Ala.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; San Antonio, Texas; and St. Louis, Mo.",
      "LendingTree's findings are based on an analysis of fair-market rents (FMR) from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The federal agency defines such rents as \"estimates of 40th percentile gross rents for standard-quality units within a metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county.\" The firm's figures exclude rents for public housing and for units built within the past two years.",

      "Layoffs from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were a primary driver of job cuts, leading to nearly 300,000 job losses this year, according to the Challenger report. DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year.",
      "DOGE accounted for another 21,000 indirect job cuts at private and nonprofit entities that lost federal funding.",

      "Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor.",
      "Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New\u00a0data from payroll firm ADP\u00a0shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:44:49 -0500",
    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Zillow, another online real estate marketplace, also expects the housing market will ease for homebuyers as inventory grows and mortgage rates tick down. The company projects existing home sales will rise to nearly 4.3 million next year, up 4.3% from its projected total for 2025. Mortgage rates are likely to hover just above 6%, according to Zillow \u2014 higher than in recent years, but modest by historical standards.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",
      "To make its projections,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0examined inventory, new construction, price growth, wage and job growth, and unemployment across the 100 cities.",

      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",

      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",

      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "The government's initial starter deposit is an appealing feature of Trump accounts, according to experts. Beyond the seed money, however, they offer fewer benefits than other savings plans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "\"A simpler approach would consolidate today's patchwork of savings accounts into universal savings accounts that are flexible, tax-neutral and easier for families to use,\" the policy research group added in a report.",
      "To save money for college, a 529 plan, which lets families sock away money for education expenses tax-free, could be a better alternative, investment experts said. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering account holders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefska described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:39:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",

The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",

      "\"Today's philanthropic gift from Michael and Susan Dell is separate from, and in addition to, our corporate commitment,\" Dell Technologies said. \"Together, these contributions provide children with meaningful financial opportunities and a transformative head start toward their futures.\"",
      "What are Trump accounts?",
      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program, according to Invest America.",
      "Sign-ups are slated to begin on July 4, 2026, with parents and caregivers needed to activate the accounts. The Department of Treasury will seed the accounts with $1,000 per child, while parents, friends and others can also contribute up to $5,000 per year.",
      "Signing up will be easy, according to details released by the Trump adminstration on Tuesday. Parents or guardians will need to file an IRS Form 4547, a one-page document that asks for basic information such as a child's home address and Social Security number, to activate the account.",
      "The accounts are limited to investing in broad U.S. stock funds that track the overall market, such as a S&P 500 fund, don't use leverage and charge no more than 0.1% in annual fees. Parents can make elections for their children's accounts at trumpaccounts.gov.",

      "\"Priority goes to younger children if demand exceeds available funds,\" they noted. \"Any remaining funds may open eligibility for older children.\"",
      "The accounts will have the same guidelines as the $1,000 accounts, with the investments locked until the children turn 18 years old, at which point they can use the money for qualified expenses like education or buying a home.",

      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",
      "Dan Savickas, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told lawmakers during the hearing that \"on average, members of both political parties outperformed the market.\"",
      "\"Each party's performance gets a boost when they control more branches of government,\" Savickas said. \"This only lends further credence to the public perception that congressional representatives are using their office for personal gain rather than public service.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:08:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Personal finance is too complex for most people to navigate, two economists contend in a new book. Is there a better way to help people deal with money?",
    "story": [
      "Americans typically score poorly in financial literacy tests. Yet they're on their own when it comes to making major financial decisions, from funding their retirement to buying a home, two economists argue in a new book that critiques the personal finance system.",
      "Take the U.S. retirement system, which has shifted away from corporate-based pensions that guaranteed income in old age toward 401(k) plans, where workers must decide how to invest their savings.",
      "In theory, taking control of your investment decisions should be empowering, but the current U.S. retirement system \"appears too complex for many people to understand,\" write Harvard University economist John Campbell and Imperial College London economist Tarun Ramadorai in \"Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone,\" published by Princeton University Press.",
      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",
      "\"We've learned that people make many mistakes, and particularly, sadly, less educated and poorer people tend to make worse mistakes,\" Campbell told CBS News.",
      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",
      "You could also have a different feature, which is called assumability, where the buyer of your house actually is able to take on your cheap mortgage, assuming that they pass the appropriate credit checks and so on.",
      "Both of those features, portability and assumability, would be really good additions to the U.S. mortgage market.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors after presenting the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Saturday, hailing the slate of artists as \"legendary in so many ways.\"",
      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sandwich-thrower-jurors-interviews-sean-dunn-washington/",
    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 20:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Sean Dunn, who threw a \"submarine-style sandwich\" at a CBP officer in downtown D.C. in July was found not guilty of misdemeanor assault in November.",
    "story": [
      "The brief federal criminal trial last month of Sean Dunn, the man who threw a \"submarine-style sandwich\" at a Customs and Border Protection officer in downtown Washington, D.C., was only a misdemeanor case. But the courtroom was filled, and the overflow room was crowded, too.",
      "The 12 jurors didn't realize initially that Dunn's case \u2014 and their verdict \u2014 would garner national attention.",
      "One juror thought the deliberations would last under an hour. The juror, a longtime resident of Washington, D.C., also noted that some people in the courtroom struggled to \"keep a straight face\" during the trial and even laughed openly.",
      "\"It seemed to me like an open and closed type of thing,\" another juror said.\u00a0 \"It was kind of ridiculous.\"",
      "Dunn hurled the sandwich at the CBP officer stationed at a busy intersection in August. The incident was widely publicized and quickly became a symbol of resistance against President Trump's federal policing crackdown and National Guard deployment in the nation's capital.",
      "After roughly seven hours of deliberation, the jury acquitted Dunn.\tIt was the second time a group of D.C. citizens rejected the Justice Department's claim that Dunn, who was fired from his job at the Justice Department after the incident, had committed a crime in tossing a sandwich at a federal agent. A separate grand jury had rejected the prosecutors' request to indict Dunn on a felony charge earlier this year.",
      "Inside the jury room",
      "Three jurors who sat on the panel spoke with CBS News about the deliberations, revealing how the politically charged case played out behind closed doors in the jury room of the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., near the U.S. Capitol.",
      "All asked to remain anonymous. A court order from the chief judge of the D.C. U.S. District Court prohibits CBS News and other media outlets from publishing the jurors' names.",
      "The jurors described an initial 10-2 split on the 12-person panel. The deliberations were not as simple as some of them had expected.",
      "The majority of jurors thought the incident did not merit criminal charges, or that criminal intent was not proven, according to two of the members of the panel. One juror told CBS News, \"I thought we'd be out of there quickly. This case had no 'grounding.' He threw a sandwich at the agent because he knew it wouldn't hurt. A reasonable person wouldn't think a sandwich is a weapon.\"",
      "A second juror, who told CBS News this was not her first time serving on a D.C. jury, said the panel eventually \"agreed that this is not and should not have been a federal case.\"",
      "The jurors said the two initial holdouts worried that a not guilty verdict would send a message that it's sometimes acceptable to throw things at federal agents.",
      "The two jurors told CBS News that the jury debated at length about the type of \"criminal intent\" that needed to have been demonstrated by prosecutors.",
      "One juror said, \"We asked each other: If we only look at this case, can someone really do harm to someone wearing a ballistic vest by throwing a sandwich?\"",
      "One of the jurors also credited the \"gentle and patient\" foreperson with coming up with a productive communications strategy during deliberations.",
      "A juror who spoke with CBS News by phone was surprised to be assigned to the case, because the juror had heard about the prior rejection by a grand jury of Sean Dunn's felony case.",
      "\"I was surprised some of the other jurors were unfamiliar with it,\" the juror said, noting the headlines generated by Dunn's arrest and the video of the sandwich toss in August.",
      "Though the case was a misdemeanor, without the prospect of a lengthy prison term for conviction, one juror said she noticed an unusual tension in the proceedings at trial.",
      "\"There seemed to be a lot of back and forth between lawyers and the judge to begin with. I've been on a jury before, and that hasn't happened,\" she said. \"So, that kind of stood out to me.\"",
      "The notoriety of Dunn's case and the political tensions surrounding the Trump administration's deployment of federal agents on the streets in D.C., added a unique stress on the jurors. Three told CBS News they're worried about being publicly identified and facing the prospect of threats or harassment.",
      "\"We were very scared and nervous about what this meant for us,\" one juror said.",
      "The same juror, who was familiar with the case before she was selected, said she thought Dunn looked \"really sad and desperate at the defense table because he was going up against the U.S. government.\"",
      "One juror noted one witness and some attorneys in the room appeared to \"giggle\" or fight to keep a \"straight face\" during some of the testimony.",
      "\"I mean,\" the juror said, \"it was a thrown sandwich.\"",

    "summary": "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation is waiving part of a fine assessed against Southwest Airlines after the company canceled thousands of flights during a winter storm in 2022.",
      "Under a 2023 settlement reached by the Biden administration, Southwest agreed to a $140 million civil penalty. The government said at the time that the penalty was the largest it had ever imposed on an airline for violating consumer protection laws.",
      "Most of the money went toward compensation for travelers. But Southwest agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S. Treasury. Southwest made a $12 million payment in 2024 and a second $12 million payment earlier this year. But the Transportation Department issued an order Friday waiving the final $11 million payment, which was due Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "The department said Southwest should get credit for significantly improving its on-time performance and investing in network operations.",
      "\"DOT believes that this approach is in the public interest as it incentivizes airlines to invest in improving their operations and resiliency, which benefits consumers directly,\" the department said in a statement. \"This credit structure allows for the benefits of the airline's investment to be realized by the public, rather than resulting in a government monetary penalty.\"",
      "The fine stemmed from a winter storm in December 2022 that paralyzed Southwest's operations in Denver and Chicago and then snowballed when a crew-rescheduling system couldn't keep up with the chaos. Ultimately the airline canceled 17,000 flights and stranded more than 2 million travelers.",
      "The Biden administration determined that Southwest had violated the law by failing to help customers who were stranded in airports and hotels, leaving many of them to scramble for other flights. Many who called the airline's overwhelmed customer service center got busy signals or were stuck on hold for hours.",
      "Even before the settlement, the nation's fourth-biggest airline by revenue said the meltdown cost it more than $1.1 billion in refunds and reimbursements, extra costs and lost ticket sales over several months.",

    "summary": "Rep. Ilhan Omar told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that if allegations of a connection between tax dollars and terrorism are true, \"that is a failure of the FBI and our court system.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said Sunday that any link between allegations of fraud by members of the Somali community and terrorism would be a \"failure of the FBI\" amid calls to investigate a series of multimillion-dollar alleged pandemic fraud schemes in Minnesota.",
      "During the Biden administration in 2022, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States,\" which revolved around a welfare program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "The Treasury Department said last week that it will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. And House Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation last week into Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the fraud cases.",
      "Omar said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that she's \"pretty confident\" that the alleged link to terrorism is a false claim, citing prosecutions and sentences that have already taken place.",
      "\"If there was a linkage in the money that they have stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out,\" Omar said.",
      "The Minnesota Democrat said the accusations have been around for many years. But she added, \"if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know.\"",
      "\"And we want those people prosecuted,\" Omar said. \"And we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.\"",
      "Minnesota is home to the largest Somali-American population in the U.S. The vast majority of the foreign-born Somali population have U.S. citizenship, according to 2024 Census Bureau figures. The bulk of those charged in the fraud scheme were of Somali descent, though the founder of the group, called Feeding Our Future, is White and was convicted at trial earlier this year.",
      "The president has blamed the fraud on the Somali people, while saying in recent days that Somali immigrants do \"nothing but complain.\" He called Omar, and \"friends\" of the Minnesota congresswoman who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager, \"garbage.\"",
      "Omar called the president's comments \"disgusting.\"",
      "\"These are Americans that he is calling garbage, and we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community, and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me,\" Omar said. \"I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric and this level of dehumanizing can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the President.\"",
      "Omar said the fraud scheme also has an impact on Somalis, \"because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota.\"",
      "\"We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen,\" she said. \"And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're, you know, we're also, as Minnesotans, as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said \"this is part of the continued cleanup.\"",
      "\"A lot of money has been transferred from the individuals who committed this fraud,\" Bessent said, alleging that individuals charged had donated to Gov. Tim Walz, Omar and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison. He said that money \"has gone overseas, and we are tracking that both to the Middle East and to Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.\"",
      "Omar said she doesn't know what Bessent is referring to.",
      "\"We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved,\" she said. \"We sent that money back a couple of years ago, and actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the Secretary of [Agriculture] asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 14:59:58 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump took aim at Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democratic congressman from Texas whom he recently pardoned, in a Truth Social post.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump slammed Rep. Henry Cuellar on Sunday for what he called \"a lack of loyalty\" because the Democratic congressman announced his plans to run again as a Democrat, rather than switch to the Republican party, in his next bid to represent Texas in the U.S. House.",
      "In a social media post, Mr. Trump suggested that he may have expected Cuellar to help Republicans maintain their slim majority in the House during the 2026 midterm elections after the congressman was granted clemency.",
      "Cuellar is a Democrat and has represented Texas' 28th district as a member of that party since 2005. Mr. Trump recently pardoned him and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, who were both indicted last year on federal bribery charges. Their two daughters, Christina and Catherine, had sent Mr. Trump a letter in November asking that he pardon their parents.",
      "The president claimed the allegations against them resulted from political targeting by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden, writing in multiple Truth Social posts about attacks on Cuellar from within the Democratic Party over his views on immigration and border security.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump issued the pardons, Cuellar announced his decision to launch another congressional campaign, still as a Democratic candidate. In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0on Sunday about Cuellar, Mr. Trump slammed the congressman for not switching parties in the wake of the president's favor.",
      "\"Only a short time after signing the Pardon, Congressman Henry Cuellar announced that he will be 'running' for Congress again, in the Great State of Texas (a state where I received the highest number of votes ever recorded!), as a Democrat, continuing to work with the same Radical left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison - And provably still do!\" wrote Mr. Trump, characterizing Cuellar's move as \"such a lack of LOYALTY.\"",
      "\"Next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!\" the president added.",
      "Cuellar discussed the pardon on Sunday during an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" saying he believed the indictment against him and his wife was an act of retaliation by Biden administration officials over his criticism of the former president's border policies.",
      "\"I now look at all the evidence, and looking at everything, definitely I feel that I was weaponized, that he [former President Biden] used the department to go after myself and my family,\" said Cuellar. \"And I'll tell you something, if they want to come after me because I was a critic about open borders, that's one thing. But you don't bring the family in. You just don't do that.\"",
      "CBS News contacted Cuellar's office for comment on Mr. Trump's Truth Social post but did not receive an immediate response.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: In this holiday season, with more Americans saying they're feeling the pain of higher prices, we will talk exclusively with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "As Washington winds down 2025, there's still a lot of unfinished business for Congress and President Trump. And, as Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, doubles down on those boat strikes in the Caribbean\u2026",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): We are tracking them, we are killing them, and we will keep killing them so long as they are poisoning our people with narcotics so lethal that they're tantamount to chemical weapons.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the debate over whether they were lawful ramps up on Capitol Hill.",
      "We will talk with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut's Jim Himes.",
      "Plus, the deportation roundups continue in the nation's cities, this time targeting communities in Minneapolis, including the congresswoman who represents most of the city.",

      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren't people that work.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Representative Ilhan Omar.",
      "And, finally, a major change to vaccine guidance for newborns recommended by a panel of advisers chosen by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb joins us to break it all down.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot of news to get to.",
      "And we begin with the secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SCOTT BESSENT (U.S. Treasury Secretary): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are out there holiday shopping. Here is how the president described back in April what to expect from this season.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Maybe the children will have two dolls, instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the president's prediction then correct?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it's actually been a very strong holiday season, and the \u2013 you know, we've seen across the \u2013 all the income cohorts thus far. And so there's nothing to say that there are two dolls, instead of 30 dolls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president was wrong to predict lower numbers of purchases and higher prices?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The economy has been better than we thought. We've had the 4 \u2013 4 percent GDP growth in a couple of quarters. We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3 percent real GDP growth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the maker of Tonka trucks, their CEO said it's going to cost 40 bucks for their toys right now because of tariffs and inflation. It was 30 bucks the year before that, 25.",
      "Prices in the toy space are accelerating, and people are feeling that.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, inflation is a composite number, and it's roughly the same year over year. And if we were to look at all imported goods, imported goods inflation is below the inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The inflation number, you mean the\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The PC \u2013 the PCE number, which is about 2.9 percent. Imported goods inflation is about 1.8. It's the service economy that's generating inflation, which actually has nothing to do with tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we hear from, for example, the president, when he says that affordability is a con job by Democrats, that seems to just not be resonating with consumers that have been polled by CBS.",
      "Sixty percent of Americans polled by this network told us President Trump makes prices and inflation sound better than they really are. And his approval rating in the economy is now down to 36 percent in our latest poll. On inflation, approval is even lower, at 32 percent.",
      "Don't you need to show that you feel the pain?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, I think the president's frustrated by the media coverage of what's going on and\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, this is the polling of average Americans.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, no, but \u2013 yes, but I think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 the average Americans, they are hearing a lot from media coverage.",
      "And I will tell you that affordability has two components. There is inflation and then there is real incomes. Real incomes are up about 1 percent. And what we're not going to do is say that Americans don't know what they're feeling. We've been working on it every day.",
      "I was on your show on March talking about affordability. The \u2013 we've made a lot of gains, but, remember, we've got this embedded inflation from the Biden years, where mainstream media, whether it was Greg Ip at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" toxic Paul Krugman at \"New York Times,\" or former Vice Chair Alan Blinder, all said it was a vibecession, the American people don't know how good they have it.",
      "Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or overregulation, that we are now seeing the \u2013 this affordability problem, and I think, next year, we're going to move on to prosperity because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do think there is an affordability problem?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do believe there's an affordability problem?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Oh, I \u2013 I think the Biden administration created a terrible\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but now. We're nearly 12 months in. You said the president would own the economy at this point.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 yes, I said that the Biden administration created the worst inflation in 50 years, and maybe, for working Americans, the worst inflation of all time.",
      "And we have pulled that number down, that Strategas Research does something called the Common Man index. Under Biden, the accumulated inflation number, as measured by CPI, was about 20 percent. Their index showed 35. This year, for the first time, the Common Man index is below the inflation index because the basket of goods for working Americans, food, gasoline, rent, is coming down.",
      "So I wrote an essay March 12, 2024, and it talked about the three I's, immigration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 interest rates and inflation.",
      "Immigrant \u2013 mass, unfettered immigration depressed wages, caused housing prices to go up. The president has closed the border. That is fixed. Interest rates have come down. The bond market just had the best year since 2020. And now we are working on inflation. And I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, grocery prices are up nearly 3 percent compared to last September.",
      "The president seems to be acknowledging that grocery prices, or at least beef prices, are a challenge, because he put out this order just yesterday saying they're going to investigate corporate price gouging for high beef prices.",
      "Isn't suing the food companies the same thing the Biden administration did, and it didn't really work? How is this any different?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, nothing the \u2013 nothing the Biden administration did worked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why are you doing it?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And the \u2013 because this isn't the same thing. If they \u2013 if they had done this, if they'd done it properly, we'd be in a different spot. And, like, beef is one component. Thanksgiving Turkey was down 16 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know you are working on the trade front and for American farmers and the prices that they are experiencing, that they're feeling a pinch about not having a market to sell into, necessarily.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Not \u2013 not anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the agricultural secretary just said that the president is going to announce a bridge payment for farmers this week to give them short-term relief while you're working on these \u2013 finalizing these trade packages.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, the \u2013 the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are these low crop prices, and the soybeans in particular.",
      "I know you spoke with China's vice premier Friday. Are they going to speed purchasing up?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, they're not going to speed purchasing up. They're in the cadence that we agreed to. Soybean prices are up about 12 or 15 percent since the agreement with the Chinese. They are going to buy 12.5 million metric tons.",
      "But, Margaret, I'm involved in the agricultural industry. I run a soybean farm, and I can tell you\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own one. You invest in it.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own or invest a soybean farm.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And people in my family go out and work on it. I actually just divested it this week as part of the \u2013 my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business.",
      "But I probably know more about any treasury secretary than \u2013 about agriculture since the 1800s. And I can tell you that what farmers need is certainty. And we have put that in place with this trade deal, 12.5 million metric tons this year, 25 million metric tons for the next three years for soybeans, also sorghum, the \u2013 and lumber.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, those purchases, just to clarify, those will be this year? Because I heard you say this past week that some of the purchases wouldn't take place until February.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, for the \u2013 for the season, so the crop year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The season year?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "But why \u2013 if everything's fine, then why do farmers need a bridge payment from the Agricultural Department?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would farmers need a bridge payment from the Agriculture Department then?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Because these prices haven't come in, because the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations.",
      "And we are going to create \u2013 create this bridge, because, again, agriculture is all about the future. You've got to start financing for planning next year, when things will be very good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that was announced this past week, the Trump Accounts, and building on this concept.",
      "S, parents, as I understand, are going to be able to open these accounts via the Treasury for their kids. They're tax-deferred investment vehicles to U.S. citizen children under 18, get $1,000 from the government for babies born between 2025 and 2028.",
      "So there are going to be restrictions on what the money can be used for, college tuition or their first house. Is that right?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, it is, the federal government for children born in the period you just described, is going to put $1,000 into these Trump Accounts. It will be invested in a widely diversified, low-cost index, and then it will be available\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the stock market, in an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, in essence, it is a trust fund. It is a piece of the American economy for every child, and they will be able to take it out when they're 18, or they can convert it to a more IRA-type program and keep it for their retirement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there won't be the restrictions I mentioned there about how they use the money?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So there was also a broadening of this, this past week, with the Dell Foundation\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 making a significant investment in the American children.",
      "So how is this going to work? Why structure it this way, instead of a savings account, for example?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a savings account just gets interest. This is the compounding power of the stock market.",
      "As Warren Buffett says, don't \u2013 don't bet against the American stock market. Don't bet against the economy. And this is going to bring a whole group of new investors into the market. We're going to couple it with a big amount of financial literacy, so that children understand what they own.",
      "The incredible gift by Michael and Susan Dell will be the \u2013 is a program that philanthropists, foundations can do to top up these accounts. And we are expecting \u2013 we're already \u2013 Treasury is already in discussions with foundations, with major philanthropists to top up these accounts.",
      "It could either be for all children, or you can specify it by zip code, a school district, or you can do what the Dells did, and say that it will be \u2013 won't apply to the zip codes of the top 20 percent of earners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And more information is going to be coming out on how to use this and access it?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, in the coming weeks, we'll do that, and then the official kickoff will be July 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about this massive fraud out in Minnesota, and the state welfare program has been under federal investigation since all the way back in 2022.",
      "The president told you, though, this week, to look into Somalis who \u2013 quote \u2013 \"ripped off that state for billions of dollars.\" He said they contribute nothing. What exactly are you investigating?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, to be clear, the initial fraud that was discovered by the IRS, for which I'm the acting commissioner, it was discovered by IRS Criminal Investigations Unit.",
      "This was not an endogenous thing that the state of Minnesota decided. We had to go in and clean up the mess for them, and this is part of the continued cleanup. A lot of money has been transferred the \u2013 from the individuals who committed this fraud, including those who donated to the government, governor, donated to Representative Omar and donated to A.G. Ellison.",
      "But they've been transferred to something called MBSes. The \u2013 and those are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mortgage-backed securities? What do you mean?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transferred to what?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: These are money the bureau services, and they are wire transfer organizations that are outside the regulated banking system, and that money has gone overseas.",
      "And we are tracking that, the \u2013 both to the Middle East and Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but you have no evidence of that money being used to fuel terrorism, which is what some conservative writers are alleging?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, that's why \u2013 that's why it's an investigation. We started it last week. We'll see where it goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But I can tell you that, you know, it's terrible.",
      "You know, Representative Omar tried to downplay it, said, oh, it was very - - the \u2013 it was very tough to know how this money should \u2013 should be used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: She was gaslighting the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll talk to her.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "But, you know, when you come to this country, you got to learn which side of the road to drive on, you got to learn to stop at stop signs, and you got to learn the \u2013 not to defraud the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are plenty of \u2013 plenty of criminal behavior from communities well beyond the immigrant community.",
      "But we'll talk about this with Representative Omar shortly.",
      "Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.",
      "Welcome to the program.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR (D-Minnesota): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on where the treasury secretary just left off.",
      "He alleged that people who were tied to you or your campaign were involved in this broad, brazen scheme to rip off the Minnesota state welfare system. Do you want to respond to that? Do you know what he is referring to?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I really don't, and I don't think the secretary himself understands what he's referring to.",
      "We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved. We sent that money back a couple years ago. And, actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the secretary of ag asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was \u2013 just for our audience, the Biden era Justice Department called it the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and this was pocketing COVID era welfare funds, more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money that was stolen. It was pretty, pretty shocking.",
      "Of the 87 people charged, all but eight are of Somali descent, and that has added to the spotlight being put specifically on your community. Why do you think this fraud was allowed to get so widespread?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, I want to say, you know, this also has an impact on Somalis, because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota.",
      "We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen. And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're \u2013 you know, we're also, as Minnesotans, as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you think, though, that there was a failure by the Democratic state government to police itself? This is a brazen fraudulent activity here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes. And that is what I alluded to in my letter that I had sent to the secretary of ag was to see where things were going wrong. How can this amount of money disappear fraudulently without there being alarms being set off?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And it is something that, you know, we have to continue to investigate. We have to continue to ask those questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, one of the initial defenses by the organization at the heart of the fraud, Feeding Our Future, was to claim the probe was due to racism. Do you think that this was all about negligence, or that it was, like, political fear of alienating the Somali community?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: So, you have to remember that the woman who led the program is a Caucasian woman. And that was her way of making sure that this would continue to happen by using whatever rhetoric that was available to her.",
      "We do know that, when the money was stopped, they did sue the A.G. Attorney General Keith Ellison defended the department in that lawsuit. It was a judge that said it should continue, that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: \u2026 should continue to go out. And so this wasn't something that people were not looking at. There was always those \u2013 those alarms.",
      "And we will continue to understand where things might have gone wrong as these investigations continue and as these fraudsters are prosecuted and sent to jail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's going to have impact for your community, because we've already heard that the head of Medicare and Medicaid say they're going to have a new policy that applies to Minnesota. You heard the treasury secretary say they're investigating.",
      "But there's another thread here, because House Republicans and the treasury secretary just now talked about a link to terrorism, a possible link. He said they're just now beginning to look into it. How confident are you that that's a false claim?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I'm pretty confident at the moment, because there are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced.",
      "If there was a linkage in that \u2013 the money that they had stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with \u2013 with these \u2013 with these charges.",
      "And so I do know that, for many years, this sort of like alarm that there is money being transferred through the airport in bags and going to terrorism has all \u2013 that accusation has always existed. There has never been here and there in those accusations.",
      "But, if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And we want those people prosecuted, and we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there are 80,000 people of Somali descent in your state, but the president has been very focused not just on them, but on you.",
      "In this extraordinary Cabinet meeting, he said, Somalis \u2013 quote \u2013 \"come from hell, they complain and they do nothing but bitch.\"",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): These are people that do nothing but complain. They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing. We don't want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.",
      "(KNOCKING SOUND)",
      "(APPLAUSE)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much, everybody.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That knocking is vehement agreement from his Cabinet members there. I just wonder what the reaction is in your district to have that from the highest office in the land.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: It's disgusting. It's completely disgusting.",
      "These are Americans that he is calling garbage. And we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me.",
      "I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric and this level of dehumanizing can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 95 percent of the Somalis in your state are U.S. citizens\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 just for clarity there.",
      "But the president has restricted all immigration processing, including asylum claims from Somalis already on U.S. soil, along with 18 other countries. ICE reports it has rounded up about 19 people, and they put out press releases with the images of about five of them that they say are the worst of the worst.",
      "Is that the entirety of the crackdown to date?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes, so far, we know, of the people that they have picked up in Minnesota, about five of them are Somalis.",
      "And from what I have read and from the people that I have spoken to, all of them had already had orders of removal. So these are not people who are undocumented, but people who have committed crimes and who should have already been sent out of the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you something else that the architect of the president's immigration policy, Stephen Miller, said.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I think it's really important that this video be made public. It's not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which, you know, six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines.",

      "But let me go back to some of the reviews I have done of other lethal action. Oftentimes, when the Department of Defense takes a strike against a terrorist in Yemen or Pakistan or wherever, you watch a video of guys fully armed with AK-47s and sidearms and bombs and you name it, and they're on their way to do something terrible.",
      "And, in this instance, you may have had bad guys. I have no doubt that these guys were involved in the running of drugs. Now, whether they were running it to the United States or Europe is yet another question.",

There was a link-up point of another potential boat. Drugs were still there. They were actively interacting with them, had to take that reattack.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does what Hegseth said match what Admiral Bradley told you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was.",
      "But Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter, right? Remember, a week after this strike, there was a briefing for Congress. Why was a follow-up strike taken? The answer then, in the first week of September, was, a follow-up strike was taken because we needed to clear the wreckage so that there wasn't a danger to navigation.",
      "That was explanation number one. Explanation number two, right before we watched the video, was that they might have had a radio, and they might have been radioing a boat, and they might have been trying to recover the cocaine. And then, when you actually watch the video, you realize they don't have a radio. They're barely hanging on and not slipping beneath the waves.",
      "Then, we get this thing of how they're trying to right the boat. This was about a 40-foot boat that had just been hit with a massive piece of munitions. The conflagration probably destroyed everything in that boat. But, oh, maybe they might have swum under, gotten a radio, probably waterlogged, and radioed a boat that we're not even sure was there.",
      "So what we've had is a series of shifting explanations, oh, and including the fog of war, right? You know that Hegseth said, well, they took the second strike because of the fog of war.",
      "There was no fog. The military watched this boat very carefully \u2013 or I shouldn't even say boat. They watched the wreckage of the boat very carefully for a long period of time before they took the second strike.",
      "So, look, what Pete Hegseth says about this strike has zero credibility at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have confidence in Admiral Bradley?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, Admiral Bradley, this was my first meeting with him. Anyone who has ever worked with Admiral Bradley will tell you that he has a storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity. And, frankly, I have no reason to doubt that.",
      "What it raises is, what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that, if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired, when he works for a guy, Pete Hegseth, who wrote a book about how we shouldn't observe the laws of war, about how we need to be lethal, et cetera.",

      "I don't think we knew the identities of any of the people in the boat. We might have known one or two. I don't know. But we certainly didn't know the identities of all 11. So nobody can characterize who all these people in any of these boats are.",
      "Now, I have enough confidence in the intelligence community to know that these are probably not guys out fishing or guys out, you know, being tourists and stuff. They are almost certainly running drugs. But this really matters, for the reason that you said.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Now, this is what we do in the terrorism world, right? We designate high-value targets, we designate individuals.",
      "I have no reason to believe, and, in fact, I doubt that there are any individuals on a list anywhere. What we are doing \u2013 and I'm not going to get terribly specific about it, for obvious reasons, but what we are doing is we're picking up that this boat may be carrying drugs.",
      "And, to the administration, it doesn't matter who's in that boat, because - - and, look, they're saying this \u2013 because, if this boat is actually carrying drugs, then we can strike it. So, no, I don't think there is a list of individuals. I don't think we have any idea who precisely the individuals in these boats are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, as I understand it, these are signature strikes. This is an intelligence assessment based on signals intelligence saying this is who we believe these individuals to be.",
      "You know, some of these defenders of the Trump policy, like conservative columnists, have argued this is a precedent that was set by the Obama administration, which used signature strikes to kill alleged al Qaeda operatives, including a U.S. citizen at one point in Yemen.",
      "Do they have a point here that the drone policy has long allowed the killing of suspected criminals even without due process?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there's a couple of really important distinctions.",
      "And you'll remember that the Obama administration, there was a lot of debate over whether signature strikes were OK or not. The most important distinction is that Congress authorized the war on terror. There was an authorization for the use of military force.",
      "The original sin of this whole thing \u2013 whether you think we should be wasting these guys or not, the original sin is that there is no congressional authorization. And then, in the Obama administration, they did have a list of individuals, right, often high-value targets, or HVTs, as we've referred to them.",
      "And then the question was, if you have an HVT, a high-value target, in a jeep in Northern Pakistan, and there's a guy next to that HVT, you know, how do you feel about taking that strike? You want to take down the high- value guy, but what about the young guy next to him? Well, the young guy has an AK-47, and the young guy was actually arranging for the transfer of explosives.",
      "You have that conversation, and then you decide whether you're going to take the strike, right? Now what we're doing \u2013 and, again, don't \u2013 I don't think that there's a list of individuals anywhere. They're just saying, that boat is carrying drugs. And even though military is not authorized by the Congress of the United States, we're taking out the boat, and we don't give a damn about who's on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and when you say \"I don't think,\" you are a member of the Gang of Eight, so, presumably, that information should be shared with you if it does exist.",

      "The Pentagon inspector general said Hegseth's actions risked operational security and violated federal laws on record keeping. Hegseth said he'd do the same thing all over again. Are your Republican colleagues saying in private that they have problems with what happened?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Absolutely, they're saying it in private.",
      "In public, of course, they're saying that it was perfect exoneration, right, that this report \u2013 and you read the key line, that this report that said that the secretary of defense put his troops and the mission at risk, that that's total exoneration.",
      "Now, I didn't hear the comment about: I would do this again.",
      "But if Pete Hegseth said he would do that again \u2013 and, look, again, you don't need to be a military expert to understand that sharing operational details before an operation is a really, really, really bad idea. If Pete Hegseth said that, that he would do that again, you know, he's just reinforcing what we all know, which is that he has absolutely no business in that job.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy, we're joined now by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and UnitedHealthcare.",
      "Welcome back.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP, voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30-year-long policy regarding hepatitis B and newborns.",
      "They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is 2 months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes.",
      "Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours.",
      "For a child over the age of 5, if they develop hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95 percent chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity.",
      "For children between the ages of 1 and 5, they only have about a 25 to 50 percent chance of clearing the infection. So, about 25 to 50 percent of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of 1 and 5. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection.",
      "But, when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90 percent of newborns who become infected \u2013 and they'll become infected during delivery \u2013 will go on to develop chronic infection. They won't be able to clear the hepatitis B. And about 25 percent of them will die from sequelae of that infection either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer.",
      "So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's almost 99 percent effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2026",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point. The refrain is \u2013 oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States came out and said, this was very good because hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true.",
      "The fact is, there's a refrain that, if you just test the moms during \u2013 while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and, if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose.",
      "But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to. Many times, those test results aren't checked. And the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when, in fact, you do, of about 2 percent.",
      "That may not sound like a lot, but that 2 percent is going to translate into at least 1,000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated, in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And, again, 25 percent of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration.",
      "And, in this board decision, which the public could listen into, it was publicly broadcast, the board was handpicked by RFK Jr., who is a skeptic here of vaccines. From those who voted against the decision to delay, one of them who you heard at the top of the show said, the CDC is doing harm.",
      "Another said: \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\"",
      "Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is \u2013 the ACIP, by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda.",
      "And, look, the secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization or many of these childhood immunizations.",
      "And I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error, insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision-making to. And what we're seeing right now is, as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored.",
      "I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP.",
      "The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, and not ACIP.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So, I think, in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision-making body, and it's going to be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There will be certain states that \u2013 that adhere to it, but it will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you \u2013 this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run at the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines.",
      "You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator Dr. Vinay Prasad are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines.",
      "What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B. This is the vaccines of the future you're saying just won't be created.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "So, Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the Biologics Center, also oversees the vaccine division, he also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the chief medical officer of the agency and chief scientific officer \u2013 so he occupies a lot of positions \u2013 put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with or move away from what they call immunobridging studies.",
      "These are studies that allow you, for well-validated vaccines like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine \u2013 the new vaccine that's formulated against a circulating strain can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza.",
      "For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a longstanding practice. It's \u2013 we do it for flu vaccine. We do it in COVID certainly. We do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes, circulating bacterial serotypes.",
      "This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening.",
      "That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the COVID vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said \u2013 and asked, did it kill more healthy kids than it saved?",
      "The administration to date has not backed up information to back up these claims, but \u2013 but what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner? Because they're arguing they're doing this to help people.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next.",
      "So, the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the COVID vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what their concerns are related to the COVID vaccine itself.",
      "These are \u2013 every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data.",
      "Analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves, are very subjective and require the good will the people involved in that.",
      "And so I think that they should make that analysis public\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: \u2026 so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in it.",
      "They've already backed away from the 10. There's reporting from Endpoints that now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: \u2026 they're saying it's eight or nine. So, they're already backing away from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who now serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy. We're joined now by former FDA commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare. Welcome back.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30 year long policy regarding Hepatitis B and newborns. They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is two months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours. For a child over the age of five, if they develop Hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95% chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity. For children between the ages of one and five, they only have about a 25 to 50% chance of clearing the infection, so about 25 to 50% of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of one and five. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection. But when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90% of newborns who become infected, and they'll become infected during delivery, will go on to develop chronic infection, they won't be able to clear the hepatitis B, and about 25% of them will die from sequelae of that infection, either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer. So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract Hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection, it's almost 99% effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2013",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point, the refrain is, oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President of the United States came out and said, this was very good, because Hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true. The fact is, there's a refrain that if you just test the moms during, while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose. But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to, many times, those test results aren't checked, and the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when in fact, you do, of about 2 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but that 2% is going to translate into at least 1000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B, and again, 25% of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration and in this board decision, which the public could listen into. It was publicly broadcast. The board was hand picked by RFK Jr, who is a skeptic here of vaccines, from those who voted against the decision to delay. One of them who you heard at the top of the show said the CDC is doing harm. Another said, \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\" Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is the ACIP by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda. And look, the Secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization, or many of these childhood immunizations, and I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision making to, and what we're seeing right now is as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored. I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP. The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and not ACIP. So I think in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision making body, and it's going to be more symbolic. There will be certain states that- that adhere to it, but will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines. You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator, Dr. Vinay Prasad, are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines. What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B, this is the vaccines of the future. You're saying just won't be created?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. So Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the biologic center. Also oversees the vaccine Division. He also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the Chief Medical Officer of the agency, and chief scientific officer. So he occupies a lot of positions. Put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with, or move away from, what they call immuno bridging studies. These are studies that allow you for well validated vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine, the new vaccine, that's formulated against the circulating strain, can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza. For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a long standing practice. It's, we do it for flu vaccine, we do it in covid Certainly, we do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes circulating bacterial serotypes. This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change, and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the Fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said, they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening. That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the Covid vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said and asked, Did it kill more healthy kids than it saved? The administration, to date, has not backed up information to back up these claims, but, but, what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner, because they're arguing they're doing this to help people?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next. So the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the covid vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what the concerns are related to the covid vaccine itself. These are- every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves are very subjective and require the goodwill the people involved in that. And so I think that they should make that analysis public so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in that they've already backed away from the 10 is reporting from endpoints that now they're saying it's eight or nine, so they're already backing away from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. And HHS said they will eventually make that data public. We'll look for it when it comes out. Dr Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Connecticut. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of the few lawmakers shown the classified version of this September 2 video of the U.S. strikes an alleged drug boat near Venezuela, four strikes in total, we have learned. You met with Admiral Bradley, who commands special operations as well. The President of the United States says he is open to this video being made public. Do you think it is essential that it become public, and are you confident it will be?",
      "REP. HIMES: I think it's really important that this video be made public. It's not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which you know, six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines. And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself. I know how the public is going to be react- is going to react because I felt my own reaction. You know, I've spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context, and this video was profoundly shaking- shaken, and I think it's important for Americans to see it. Because, look, there's a certain amount of there's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners, but I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was it- why did it shake you so much? What specifically was bothering you?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, you know, and this is sort of the distinction, and there's a lot to unpack here about whether this is an authorized military action, which it is not, and right on down to whether these were legitimate- legitimate targets, and they were not. But let me go back to some of the reviews I've done of other lethal action. Oftentimes, when the Department of Defense takes a strike against a terrorist in Yemen or Pakistan or wherever, you watch a video of guys fully armed with AK-47s and sidearms and bombs and you name it, and they're on their way to do something terrible. And in this instance, you may have had bad guys, I have no doubt that these guys were involved in the running of drugs. Now, whether they were running it to the United States or Europe is yet another question. But in that instance, these guys were about to die. Had the United States just walked away, their little piece of wood would have gone under the waves. And as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing. Because under the law, and if you spent 15 minutes in law school, you know this, under the law, if someone has been struck and is- continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target. But if they are outside of combat, they are not and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war. And these guys, and this is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were, were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the DOD law of war manual seems to hinge a lot of that on whether the person is wholly disabled from fighting, and that is where the Secretary of Defense has used language saying they're about to return to the fight. I'm going to play for you what Secretary Hegseth said at the Reagan Forum Saturday. He described what was happening with these four strikes on the alleged drug running boat.",
      "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PETE HEGSETH ON TAPE: A couple hours later, I was told, hey, there had to be a reattack, because there were a couple folks that could still be in the fight. Access to radios, there was a link up point of another potential boat, drugs were still there, they were actively interacting with them. Had to take that reattack. I said, Roger, sounds good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does what Hegseth said match what Admiral Bradley told you?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was, but Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter, right? Remember, a week after this strike, there was a briefing for Congress. Why was a follow up strike taken? The answer then, in the first week of September, was a follow up strike was taken because we needed to clear the wreckage so that there wasn't a danger to navigation. That was explanation number one. Explanation number two, right before we watched the video, was that they might have had a radio, and they might have been radioing a boat, and they might have been trying to recover the cocaine. And then when you actually watch the video, you realize they don't have a radio. They're barely hanging on and not slipping beneath the waves. Then we get this thing of how they're trying to right the boat. This was about a 40 foot boat that had just been hit with a massive piece of munitions. The conflagration probably destroyed everything in that boat. But, oh, maybe they might have swum under, gotten a radio, probably waterlogged, and radioed a boat that we're not even sure was there. So what we've had is a series of shifting explanations. Oh, and including the fog of war, right? You know that Hegseth said, well, they took the second strike because of the fog of war. There was no fog. The military watched this boat very carefully, or I shouldn't even say, boat, they watched the wreckage of the boat very carefully for a long period of time before they took the second strike. So, look, what Pete Hegseth says about this strike has zero credibility at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have confidence in Admiral Bradley?",
      "REP. HIMES: You know Admiral Bradley, this was my first meeting with him. Anyone who has ever worked with Admiral Bradley will tell you that he has a storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity. And frankly, I have no reason to doubt that. What it raises is, what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired. When he works for a guy, Pete Hegseth, who wrote a book about how we shouldn't observe the laws of war, about how we need to be lethal in [unintelligible]. It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that, if he weren't in that context, he might not do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said there were dozens of JAG law- lawyers observing all of this. On NBC this morning he said all 11 people on the suspected drug smuggling boat were valid targets because the U.S. had high confidence they were part of a foreign terrorist organization. Do you know, were these high level cartel members?",
      "REP. HIMES: No, of course not. Of course not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who were they, if the U.S. had high confidence--",
      "REP. HIMES: You think Pablo Escobar back- well, first of all, first of all, let's be super clear about this. I don't think we knew the identities of any of the people in the boat. We might have known one or two, I don't know, but we certainly didn't know the identities of all 11. So nobody can characterize who all these people in any of these boats are. Now, I have enough confidence in the intelligence community to know that these are probably not guys out fishing or guys out, you know, being tourists and stuff. They are almost certainly running drugs. But this really matters for the reason that you said. You know, if you're going to occupy an immense amount of the American naval combat capability, you'd like to believe that you're going after the leaders, the cartel leaders, the- the kingpins, as they say. What we're doing here is we're taking out the equivalent of the corner drug dealer in the Bronx, right? Which, by the way, we should arrest the corner drug dealer in the Bronx. But the main reason we do that is to go after the kingpins who, I promise you, are sitting in very comfortable villas right now in Colombia and Venezuela and everywhere, and watching as much of the United States Navy is dedicated to taking out their lowest level employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I hear you saying they were not on an internal military target list for high value individuals. That's what I hear, what you're saying.",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, this is an interesting question. I'm not at all convinced that there is a list of individuals. Now, this is what we do in the terrorism world, right? We designate high value targets. We designate individuals. I have no reason to believe, and in fact, I doubt that there are any individuals on the list anywhere. What we are doing, and I'm not going to get terribly specific about it, for obvious reasons, but what we are doing is we're picking up that this boat may be carrying drugs, and to the administration, it doesn't matter who's in that boat, because- and look, they're saying this, because if this boat is actually carrying drugs, then we can strike it. So no, I don't think there is a list of individuals. I don't think we have any idea who precisely the individuals in these boats are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So as I understand it, these are signature strikes. This is an intelligence assessment based on signals intelligence saying this is who we believe these individuals to be. You know, some of these defenders of the Trump policy, like conservative columnists, have argued this is a precedent that was set by the Obama administration, which used signature strikes to kill alleged al Qaeda operatives, including a U.S. citizen at one point in Yemen. Do they have a point here that the drone policy has long allowed the killing of suspected criminals, even without due process?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, there's a couple of really important distinctions, and you'll remember that the Obama administration, there was a lot of debate over whether signature strikes were okay or not. The most important distinction is that Congress authorized the war on terror. There was an authorization for the use of military force. The original sin of this whole thing, whether you think we should be wasting these guys or not, the original sin is that there is no congressional authorization. And then in the Obama administration, they did have a list of individuals, right? Often high value targets, or HVTs as we've referred to them. And then the question was, if you have an HVT, a high value target, in a jeep in northern Pakistan, and there's a guy next to that HVT, you know, how do you feel about taking that strike? You want to take down the high value guy, but what about the young guy next to him? Well, the young guy has an AK 47 and the young guy was actually arranging for the transfer of explosives. You have that conversation, and then you decide whether you're gonna take the strike. Right now what we're doing, and again, don't- I don't think that there's a list of individuals anywhere. They're just saying that boat is carrying drugs. And even though military is not authorized by the Congress of the United States, we're taking out the boat, and we don't give a damn about who's on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and when you say \"I don't think,\" you are a member of the Gang of Eight, so presumably that information should be shared with you if it does exist. I want to ask you before I let you go. Signalgate, people may remember a few months ago, the Trump- a Trump official added a journalist to an online group on Signal and shared advanced information of an upcoming bombing operation in Yemen. The Pentagon Inspector General said Hegseth's actions risked operational security and violated federal laws on record keeping. Hegseth said he'd do the same thing all over again. Are your Republican colleagues saying in private that they have problems with what happened?",
      "REP. HIMES: Absolutely, they're saying it in private. In public, of course, they're saying that it was perfect exoneration, right? That this report, and you read the key line, that this report that said that the Secretary of Defense put his troops in the mission at risk, that that's total exoneration. Now, I didn't hear the comment about I would do this again. But if Pete Hegseth said he would do that again- and look, again, you don't need to be a military expert to understand that sharing operational details before an operation is a really, really, really bad idea. If Pete Hegseth said that, that he would do that again, you know, he's just reinforcing what we all know, which is that he has absolutely no business in that job. One of the most sensitive and difficult jobs to do in the United States government is being done by somebody who put his own people and the mission at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 He said he lives life without regret at the Reagan Forum, that was the phrase, to be more exact. But Congressman Himes, always good to have you on the program. I'll have to leave it there for today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Welcome to the program.",
      "REP. ILHAN OMAR: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "REP. OMAR: We have a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on where the Treasury Secretary just left off. He alleged that people who were tied to you or your campaign were involved in this broad, brazen scheme to rip off the Minnesota state welfare system. Do you want to respond to that? Do you know what he is referring to?",
      "REP. OMAR: I really don't, and I don't think the Secretary himself understands what he's referring to. We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved. We sent that money back a couple years ago. And actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the Secretary of Ag asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was just for our audience. The Biden-era Justice Department called it the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and this was pocketing COVID-era welfare funds, more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money that was stolen. It was pretty, pretty shocking. Of the 87 people charged, all but eight are of Somali descent, and that has added to the spotlight being put specifically on your community. Why do you think this fraud was allowed to get so widespread?",
      "REP. OMAR: I want to say, you know, this also has an impact on Somalis, because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota. We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen. And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're, you know, we're also as Minnesotans as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you think, though, that there was a failure by the Democratic state government to police itself? This is a brazen fraudulent activity here.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah, and that is what I alluded to in my letter that I had sent to the Secretary of Ag was to see where things were going wrong. How can this amount of money disappear fraudulently without there being alarms being set off? And it is something that you know, we have to continue to investigate. We have to continue to ask those questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, one of the initial defenses by the organization at the heart of the fraud, Feeding Our Future, was to claim the probe was due to racism. Do you think that this was all about negligence, or that it was like political fear of alienating the Somali community?",
      "REP. OMAR: So you have to remember that the woman who led the program is a Caucasian woman, and that was her way of making sure that this would continue to happen by using whatever rhetoric that was available to her. We do know that when the money was stopped, they did sue the AG. Attorney General Keith Ellison defended the department in that lawsuit. It was a judge that said it should contin- that money should continue to go out. And so this wasn't something that people were not looking at. There was always those, those alarms, and we will continue to understand where things might have gone wrong as these investigations continue, and as these fraudsters are prosecuted and sent to jail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's going to have impact for your community, because we've already heard that the head of Medicare and Medicaid say they're going to have a new policy that applies to Minnesota. You heard the Treasury Secretary say they're investigating. But there's another thread here, because House Republicans and the Treasury Secretary just now talked about a link to terrorism, a possible link. He said they're just now beginning to look into it. How confident are you that that's a false claim?",
      "REP. OMAR: I'm pretty confident at the moment, because there are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced. If there was a linkage in that, the money that they had stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with- with these, with these charges. And so I do know that for many years, this sort of like alarm that there is money being transferred through the airport in bags and going to terrorism has all- that accusation has always existed. There has never been here and there in those accusations. But if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know and we want those people prosecuted, and we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there are 80,000 people of Somali descent in your state, but the President has been very focused not just on them, but on you. In this extraordinary cabinet meeting, he said, Somalis, quote, \"come from hell.\" \"They complain and they do nothing but bitch.\" Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are people that do nothing but complain. They complain, and from where they came from, they've got nothing.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: \u2026We don't want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.\"",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That knocking is vehement agreement from his Cabinet members there. I just wonder what the reaction is in your district to have that from the highest office in the land.",
      "REP. OMAR: It's disgusting. It's completely disgusting. These are Americans that he is calling garbage. And we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community, and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me. I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric and this level of dehumanizing can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 95% of the Somalis in your state are U.S. citizens.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yes.",
      "MARAGARET BRENNAN: Just for clarity there. But the president has restricted all immigration processing, including asylum claims from Somalis already on U.S. soil, along with 18 other countries. ICE reports it has rounded up about 19 people, and they put out press releases with the images of about five of them that they say are the worst of the worst is that the entirety of the crackdown to date?",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah, so far we know of the people that they have picked up in Minnesota, about five of them are Somalis, and from what I have read and from the people that I've spoken to, all of them had already had orders of removal. So these are not people who are undocumented, but people who have committed crimes and who should have already been sent out of the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you something else that the architect of the President's immigration policy, Stephen Miller, said. On Thanksgiving day he posted, \"No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions. and terrors, of their broken homelands.\"",
      "What do you make of this argument of failure to assimilate and sort of ruining America. How do you understand this?",
      "REP. OMAR: I mean, when I think about Stephen Miller and his white supremist rhetoric, it reminds me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's how you hear it--",
      "REP. OMAR: Yes, it reminds me of the way the Nazis described Jewish people in Germany. And you know, as we know, there have been many immigrants who have tried to come to the United States who have turned back, you know, one of them being Jewish immigrants. We know the way that people were described who were coming from Ireland, Irish immigrants. We know the way in which people were described back then, when there were Italian immigrants. And to me, you know, we're, we're, yes, of course, ethnically Somali, we are in this country as Americans, we are citizens, we are a productive part of this nation, and we will continue to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for your time today. And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' We have a lot of news to get to, and we begin with the Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent. Good to have you here.",
      "TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Morning, Margaret.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are out there holiday shopping. Here is how the President described back in April, what to expect from this season.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the President's prediction then, correct?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, it's actually been a very strong holiday season, and the- you know, we've seen across all the income cohorts thus far. And so there's nothing to say that there are two dolls instead of 30 dolls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President was wrong to predict lower numbers of purchases and higher prices?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: The economy has been better than we thought. We've had the 4- 4% GDP growth in a couple of quarters. We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3% real GDP growth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the maker of Tonka Trucks, their CEO, said it's going to cost 40 bucks for their toys right now because of tariffs and inflation, it was 30 bucks the year before that, 25. Prices in the toy space are accelerating, and people are feeling that.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, Margaret inflation is a composite number, and it's roughly the same year over year. And if we were to look at all imported goods, imported goods inflation is below the inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The inflation number, you mean the--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: The PC- the PCE number which is about 2.9%. Imported goods inflation is about 1.8. It's the service economy that's generating inflation, which actually has nothing to do with tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we hear from for example, the President, when he says that affordability is a con job by Democrats, that seems to just not be resonating with consumers that have been polled by CBS. 60% of Americans polled by this network told us President Trump makes prices and inflation sound better than they really are, and his approval rating in the economy is now down to 36% in our latest poll. On inflation, approval is even lower, 32%. Don't you need to show that you feel the pain?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, Margaret, I think the President's frustrated by the media coverage of what's going on--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the polling of average Americans.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --No, no- yeah, but I think the average Americans, they are hearing a lot from media coverage. And I will tell you that affordability has two components, there is inflation, and then there is real incomes. Real incomes are up about 1% and what we're not going to do is say that Americans don't know what they're feeling. We've been working on it every day. I was on your show on March talking about affordability. The- we've made a lot of gains, but remember, we've got this embedded inflation from the Biden years, where mainstream media, whether it's Greg Ip at the Wall Street Journal, toxic Paul Krugman at New York Times or former Vice Chair, Alan Blinder, all said it was a vibecession. The American people don't know how good they have it. Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or over regulation, that we are now seeing the- this. affordability problem, and I think next year we're going to move on to prosperity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do think there is an affordability problem?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do believe there's an affordability problem?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Oh, I think the Biden administration created a terr--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but now we're nearly 12 months in, you said the President would own the economy at this point.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I said that the Biden administration created the worst inflation in 50 years, and maybe for working Americans, the worst inflation of all time. And we have pulled that number down- that Strategas research does something called the common man index. Under Biden, the accumulated inflation number, as measured by CPI, was about 20%. Their index showed 35. This year for the first time, the common man index is below the inflation index because the basket of goods for working Americans, food, gasoline, rent is coming down. So I wrote an essay March 12, 2024, and it talked about the three I's, immigration, interest rates and inflation. Immigrant- mass, unfettered immigration, depressed wages caused housing prices to go up. President has closed the border that is fixed. Interest rates have come down. The bond market just had the best year since 2020 and now we are working on inflation, and I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, grocery prices are up nearly 3% compared to last September. The President seems to be acknowledging that grocery prices, or at least beef prices, are a challenge, because he put out this order just yesterday saying they're going to investigate corporate price gouging for high beef prices. Isn't suing the food companies the same thing the Biden administration did, and it didn't really work? How is this any different?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, nothing- nothing the Biden administration did worked--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why are you doing it?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Because this isn't the same thing. If they- if they had done this, if they'd done it properly, we'd be in a different spot. And like, beef is one component. Thanksgiving Turkey was down 16%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know you are working on the trade front, and for American farmers and the prices that they are experiencing, that they're feeling a pinch about not having a market to sell into, necessarily.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Not- not anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the agricultural Secretary just said that the President is going to announce a bridge payment for farmers this week to give them short term relief while you're working on these- finalizing these trade packages. There are these low crop prices, and the soybeans in particular, I know you spoke with China's Vice Premier Friday. Are they going to speed purchasing up?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, they're not going to speed purchasing up. They're in the cadence that we agreed to. Soybean prices are up about 12 or 15% since the agreement with the Chinese. They are going to buy 12.5 million metric tons. But Margaret, I'm involved in the agricultural industry. I run a soybean farm, and I can tell you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own one, you invest in it.",
      "SE. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own or invest in--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --People in my family go out and work on it. I actually just divested it this week as part of the- my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business. But I probably know more about any Treasury Secretary than- about agriculture since the 1800s and I can tell you that what farmers need is certainty, and we have put that in place with this trade deal. 12 and a half million metric tons this year, 25 million metric tons for the next three years, for soybeans, also sorghum, the- and lumber.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those purchases, just to clarify, those will be this year, because I heard you say this past week that some of the purchases wouldn't take place until February.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, for the- for the season, so the crop year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The season year?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Yep.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. But why- if everything's fine, then why do farmers need a bridge payment from the Agricultural Department?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would farmers need a bridge payment from the Agriculture Department, then?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Because these prices haven't come in, because the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations. And we are going to create this bridge because, again, agriculture is all about the future. You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that was announced this past week, the Trump accounts, and building on this concept so parents, as I understand, are going to be able to open these accounts via the Treasury for their kids, their tax deferred investment vehicles to U.S. citizen children under 18, get $1,000 from the government for babies born between 2025 and 2028. So there are going to be restrictions on what the money can be used for college tuition or their first house, is that right?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: No, it is- the federal government for children born in the period you just described, is going to put $1,000 into these Trump accounts, it will be invested in a widely diversified, low cost index, and then it will be available--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the stock market, in an exchange traded fund or mutual fund.",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: So in essence, it is a trust fund. It is a piece of the American economy for every child, and they will be able to take it out when they're 18, or they can convert it to a more IRA-type program and keep it for their retirement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there won't be the restrictions I mentioned there about how they use the money?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so there was also a broadening of this- this past week, with the Dell Foundation making a significant investment in the American children. So how is this going to work? Why structure it this way, instead of a savings account, for example?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a savings account just gets interest. This is the compounding power of the stock market. As Warren Buffett says, don't- don't bet against the American stock market, don't bet against the economy. And this is going to bring a whole group of new investors into the market. We're going to couple it with a big amount of financial literacy, so that children understand what they own. The incredible gift by Michael and Susan Dell will be the- is a program that philanthropists' foundations can do to top up these accounts. And we are expecting, we're already at- Treasury is already in discussions with foundations, with major philanthropists to top up these accounts. It could either be for all children, or you can specify it by zip code, a school district, or you can do what the Dells did, and say that it will be- won't apply to the zip codes of the top 20% of earners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And more information is going to be coming out on how to use this and access it?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, in the coming weeks, we'll do that, and then the official kickoff will be July 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about this massive fraud out in Minnesota, and the state welfare program has been under federal investigation since all the way back in 2022. The President told you, though, this week, to look into Somalis who, quote, ripped off that state for billions of dollars. He said they contribute nothing. What exactly are you investigating?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, to be clear, the initial fraud that was discovered by the IRS for which I'm the Acting Commissioner- is discovered by IRS Criminal Investigations Unit. This was not an endogenous thing that the state of Minnesota decided. We had to go in and clean up the mess for them, and this is part of the continued cleanup. A lot of money has been transferred the- from the individuals who committed this fraud, including those who donated to the government- Governor, donated to Representative Omar and donated to AG Ellison, but they've been transferred to something called MBs--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mortgage backed securities, what--?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transferred to what?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: These are money- the- bureau services, and they are wire transfer organizations that are outside the regulated banking system, and that money has gone overseas, and we are tracking that- the- both to the Middle East and Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you have no evidence of that money being used to fuel terrorism, which is what some conservative writers are alleging?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: That's why it's an investigation. We started it last week. We'll see where it goes. But I can tell you that, you know, it's terrible. You know, Representative Omar tried to downplay it. Said, oh, it was very- the- it was very tough to know how this money should- should be used. She was gaslighting the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll talk to her.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Yeah. But, you know, when you come to this country, you got to learn which side of the road to drive on. You got to learn to stop at stop signs, and you got to learn the- not to defraud the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are plenty of- plenty of criminal behavior from communities well beyond the immigrant community, but we'll talk about this with Representative Omar shortly. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has \"zero credibility\" on the September strikes on an alleged drug boat, citing \"shifting explanations\" from the Pentagon for the second strike, which has drawn scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "Himes was among a small number of lawmakers who last week received briefings from military officials behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, which centered on the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, including the Sept. 2 follow-on strike that has become a flashpoint in Congress. The lawmakers were shown video of the second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, after the Washington Post reported a week earlier that a second attack killed two survivors of the initial strike.",
      "Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the briefing that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Himes urged that it's \"really important that this video be made public,\" noting that the interpretation of the video from lawmakers who were briefed \"broke down precisely on party lines.\"",
      "\"And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself,\" Himes said. \"I know how the public is going to react because I felt my own reaction.\"",
      "Himes said he's spent hours looking at videos of lethal action taken by the U.S., while noting that he was \"profoundly shaken\" by the video of the Sept. 2 strikes.",
      "\"There's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners, but I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under, just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing,\" Himes said.",
      "The strike was the first in the administration's campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Southern Hemisphere. Since then, the U.S. has conducted more than 20 strikes and killed more than 80 people. Even before the Post's report, the attacks had attracted scrutiny from lawmakers since the administration is conducting them without authorization from Congress. But the administration has argued that since it has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations, it has the legal authority to conduct the strikes, although the administration has not offered proof the vessels are being operated by drug cartels.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who was also briefed last week, refuted Himes' characterization of the video last week. And on Sunday, he told \"Meet the Press\" that the survivors \"were not incapacitated in any way,\" adding that it was \"entirely appropriate to strike the boat again to make sure that its cargo was destroyed.\"",
      "Cotton said it appeared the individuals were \"sitting or standing on top of a capsized boat, they weren't floating helplessly in the water.\"",
      "\"I don't think it matters all that much what they were trying to do,\" Cotton said, adding that it looked at one point like they were trying to flip the boat back over.",
      "Himes responded to the comments on \"Face the Nation\" saying, \"as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing.\"",
      "\"If someone has been struck and continues to engage in hostilities \u2014 points a gun at you, has a gun \u2014 they may be a legitimate target, but if they are outside of combat, they are not and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war,\" Himes said. \"And these guys \u2014 and this is why the American people need to see this video \u2014 these guys were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.\"",
      "The lawmakers were briefed by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, who was leading the mission and whom Hegseth has said made the decision to strike the boat again.",
      "Himes said people who have worked with Bradley describe him as having had a \"storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity.\" But he said what the incident raises \"is what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired.\"",
      "\"It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that if he weren't in that context, he might not do,\" Himes added.",
      "Hegseth described his own role in the Sept. 2 strikes at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday, saying he was told there had to be a \"reattack\" because there were \"a couple folks who could still be in the fight,\" citing possible access to radio, drugs still present and a \"linkup point of another potential boat.\"",
      "\"I said, 'roger, sounds good,'\" Hegseth said. \"From what I understood then and what I understand now, I fully support that strike. I would have made the same call myself.\"",
      "Asked by Brennan whether the secretary's statement matched what he was told in the briefing, Himes said \"there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was.\"\"But Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter,\" Himes added.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's elevation of a vaccine skeptic to lead a high-profile office within the Food and Drug Administration is raising alarm among multiple senior FDA officials, who told CBS News the appointment will harm the agency's reputation as a reliable steward of the nation's drug supply.",
      "On Wednesday, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg was tapped as acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which is responsible for evaluating new drugs and ensuring adequate supplies of existing ones. Her appointment came after the abrupt resignation of Richard Pazdur, a veteran FDA scientist who took over the office just three weeks ago.",
      "\"Putting Tracy Beth in charge is like dropping an atom bomb,\" one agency source said, adding that multiple top-level officials are preparing resignations. \"It's an extinction level event. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg has never supervised a drug review, never has conducted a clinical trial. She doesn't understand laws and regulations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about H\u00f8eg's qualifications. H\u00f8eg did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a statement when she was appointed, H\u00f8eg said, \"I am committed to transparency, honesty, and decisions based on rigorous science and ensuring important changes happen efficiently.\"",
      "H\u00f8eg has been a controversial figure. This fall, she advocated making it more difficult for young men to receive the COVID vaccine because of the potential risks from a rare side effect, myocarditis,\u00a0according to STAT News. Since joining the FDA in March, she has been advising Commissioner Marty Makary on the agency's vaccine policy, and helped write a recent memo claiming FDA leaders found at least 10 children had died \"after and because of\" receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The memo, which was obtained by CBS News, offered no data to back that claim. HHS said it plans to release data on it soon.",
      "That memo also outlined planned agency changes in handling COVID-19 and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign. After it was made public, a dozen former FDA leaders denounced the proposed changes, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine that they \"undermine a regulatory model designed to ensure vaccine safety, effectiveness, and availability\" and \"represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job.\"",
      "In her new role, H\u00f8eg will oversee an office charged with ensuring all over-the-counter and prescription drugs in America are safe and effective. The office is also tasked with approving new drugs that pharmaceutical companies are seeking to bring to market and providing guidance to health care professionals and consumers.",
      "One senior FDA official said there is widespread fear that H\u00f8eg will politicize a science-focused office responsible for America's drug development and pipeline. As a result, the source said, companies might no longer view the FDA as a reliable partner and may choose to develop new products overseas, where the regulatory environment is \"more stable.\"",
      "H\u00f8eg, who is a sports medicine physician and epidemiologist, served as the FDA's representative on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that on Friday revised decadeslong guidance on when children should get their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.",
      "During Friday's meeting, H\u00f8eg questioned the childhood vaccination schedule, saying the U.S. is an \"international outlier\" in the number of vaccines it recommends for children.",
      "\"Why are we so different from other developed nations, and is it scientifically and medically justified?\" she asked, later adding, \"just because the U.S. has a larger high-risk population of children, should the core childhood vaccination schedule be larger like this?\"",
      "\"Scientifically, it doesn't make sense to make different recommendations for low-risk populations from one country to another,\" she said.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics says the longstanding U.S. recommendations are based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Still, H\u00f8eg acknowledged the effectiveness of some vaccines, citing the recent measles outbreak.",
      "\"The increase is predominantly among the unvaccinated,\" she said. \"This is reality. It's important to state, we know the measles vaccine does prevent measles, and that we are seeing measles cases among unvaccinated children.\"",
      "In a statement announcing H\u00f8eg's appointment, Makary said she was \"the right scientist to fully modernize\" the drug regulator's office. He added \"she advanced scientific rigor through her commitment to providing the public with the highest quality of evidence.\"",
      "During Friday's advisory meeting, H\u00f8eg noted declining trust in the U.S. health care system during the pandemic and linked the erosion to vaccine mandates, continued masking and political polarization.",
      "\"I do think that that has contributed to a loss of trust when people are coerced to take vaccines,\" she said.",
      "H\u00f8eg is the fifth person this year to head a drug office that has been rocked by sudden leadership changes. In November, George Tidmarsh resigned after federal officials began reviewing \"serious concerns about his personal conduct,\" according to a government spokesperson. Tidmarsh has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Pazdur, who was appointed director of the office less than a month ago, was a 26-year veteran of the agency who specialized in cancer drug approvals. He resigned after clashing with Makary, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The sources said Pazdur agreed to do the job on the condition that Makary didn't intervene with the office's work. But within weeks, the FDA chief began interviewing candidates to fill roles Pazdur oversaw. One of the sources said Pazdur demanded Makary resign, and when he didn't, the cancer scientist stepped down.",

    "summary": "President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday, when the justices convene to hear a case that could lead to the dismantling of protections meant to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The case, known as Trump v. Slaughter, arose from Mr. Trump's move to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her post at the Federal Trade Commission without cause, despite a federal statute that limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Now, the high court is set to decide whether those removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers, and whether it should overturn a landmark 1935 decision in a case called Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "The legal battle is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of Humphrey's Executor by the court's conservative justices. In that 90-year-old ruling, which involved President Franklin Roosevelt's attempt to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission, the high court allowed Congress to shield certain independent agency members from being removed by the president at will.",
      "But in several recent decisions, the conservative justices have chipped away at the precedent. Most recently, it ended removal protections for officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, he has sought to expand the bounds of presidential power and moved to fire a swath of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions.",
      "Trump's firing of Slaughter",
      "Slaughter was among the victims of the president's campaign to \"reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.\" Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by Biden, she received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "The president's move to fire Slaughter and a fellow Democratic commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya, left the FTC with only three commissioners, who were all Republicans.",
      "Slaughter, like many other independent agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, sued to get her job back and argued that her removal was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. But Mr. Trump had not followed the law, she argued.",
      "A federal district court ruled in her favor, finding that Slaughter's removal was unlawful. It ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But that decision was the first in a series of re-hirings and re-firings. Days after Slaughter prevailed before the district court, the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks after that, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated once again.",
      "Then, when the Trump administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts cleared the way for her firing. The high court agreed in late September to hear the case and continued to keep her out of her post while it considers whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers.",
      "What's at stake",
      "That issue, and the fate of its 1935 precedent, will be before the high court Monday, when the justices convene for arguments.",
      "\"It's very likely the Supreme Court is going to say that in order for the president to be able to do his job, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, he has to have control of the people helping him execute those laws,\" said Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision could have significant ramifications for the structure of the federal government and curtail Congress' power to impose limits on the president's removal power.",
      "\"The president is supposed to have certain powers that are separated from the legislative branch, and if the legislative branch goes in there and says we're going to interfere with your powers by saying you're not allowed to remove these people, that's a violation of the separation of powers,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies that regulate many aspects of American life, from nuclear waste to telemarketing to consumer products, with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power for multi-member agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers. The high court found that the FTC fit within those parameters, and its commissioners could therefore only be removed for cause.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that the trade commission of today is different from the agency of 90 years ago because it has amassed executive powers. The modern FTC executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote.",
      "Additionally, the FTC can now file civil suits seeking monetary penalties, make substantive rules, issue final orders in agency adjudications and investigate potential violations, he said.",
      "\"The notion that some agencies that exercise executive power can be sequestered from presidential control seriously offends the Constitution's structure and the liberties that the separation of powers protects,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Impacts of the court's decision",
      "If the Supreme Court invalidates the removal protections for FTC commissioners, such a decision is likely to reach far beyond the commission.",
      "Because many statutes restrict a president to removing an official for inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office, Fitzpatrick predicted the high court will \"say those words are an unconstitutional restriction on the president so all the other agencies with those words will be in the same boat.\"",
      "Lawyers for Slaughter, meanwhile, warned of the broad impacts of a decision overturning the Supreme Court's 1935 decision, writing in a filing that doing so would destabilize institutions that have been woven into the fabric of U.S. governance.",
      "\"Multimember independent agencies are deeply ingrained in our Nation's history and tradition, from the First Congress to the present day,\" they said. \"That history confirms that they are fully compatible with our Constitution's text and structure.\"",
      "Slaughter's legal team argued that the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to transfer new powers to the president that Congress chose not to give him and wants courts to \"jettison longstanding laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.\"",
      "They also said the current structure of multimember independent agencies \u2014 composed of members from both parties who serve for staggered terms and are insulated from political shifts \u2014 leads to \"more modest actions\" and therefore protects individual liberty better than an agency helmed by a single person.",
      "\"What the statutory protection for a member's tenure guarantees is that a political minority, the minority party, will always be represented in deliberations, which is at the very least an important watchdog function,\" said Peter Shane, a legal scholar at New York University School of Law.",
      "He continued: \"But the other thing is it prevents presidents from sabotaging agencies and sabotaging the congressional design, either by eliminating from the agency members of the minority party, or enough members so that an agency lacks a quorum to function at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has already attempted to make his mark on the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects the rights of government workers. The president fired one of its members, Cathy Harris, in February, leaving the MSPB without a quorum between April and October.",
      "\"A president opposed to the statutory mission of an agency can entirely kneecap it by depriving it of a quorum, and the president can certainly deprive it of genuine bipartisanship by refusing to fill the seats that would belong to the minority party,\" Shane said. \"The minority signaling function is quite important and it has multiple audiences, including the majority on a particular commission. But it also includes journalists, the general public and the courts.\"",
      "Slaughter's lawyers argued that even with protections in place for leaders of independent agencies, presidents can still exert influence over them through the candidates they nominate and the chair they select, as well as through recommending or vetoing spending bills that affect agency operations.",
      "A key issue for the court will be how it characterizes the powers that an agency wields. When the Supreme Court earlier this year allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the MSPB, it suggested in an unsigned order that the agencies \"exercise considerable executive power.\" A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday that removal protections for the two labor boards are unconstitutional and said Congress cannot restrict the president's ability to remove their members.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0attempted to fire\u00a0a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will\u00a0hear arguments on the case next month.",
      "\"All the agencies these days have a lot of powers, adjudicatory powers, rule-making powers, enforcement powers,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I suspect no matter how they do it, all the independent agencies with the exception of the Fed are going to be under the president's thumb.\"",
      "But more than 200 members of Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. Invalidating for-cause removal protections would have drastic consequences for the structure and operation of the federal government, they wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"[A]t-will removals of commissioners of independent agencies would lead regulated entities and the public to believe that the President is able to pick winners and losers in the American economy through intervening in individual cases,\" they said. \"That would detrimentally alter the way the public interacts with these regulators, and, consequently, the economic choices the regulators make.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Sunday's announcement of the 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame's Contemporary Era Class, President Trump on Saturday called on the committee to admit pitcher Roger Clemens, who is one of eight players on the ballot.",
      "In a lengthy Truth Social post, the president argued that the committee \"should do the right thing by finally putting Roger Clemens, known as 'The Rocket,' in the Hall!,\" adding that Clemens is \"clearly one of the Greatest Pitchers of All Time.\"",
      "The president noted Clemens' 354 career wins, ninth all-time in Major League Baseball history, and his seven Cy Young awards, an annual achievement given out to the best pitchers in the American and National leagues. He also had 4,672 strikeouts, third all-time behind Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Randy Johnson (4,875).",
      "The 63-year-old Clemens has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, which he has denied. In June of 2012, following a 10-week trial,\u00a0a federal jury found Clemens not guilty\u00a0of charges that he obstructed and lied to Congress in denying he had used PEDs.",
      "\"The only reason he is not is because of rumors and innuendo, which were not proven,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"He never tested positive and, when the Obama DOJ went after him in a criminal case claiming that he did take steroids, Roger, who has always denied taking any drugs, was FULLY ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES.\"",
      "Clemens was charged over a deposition and congressional testimony he gave in February 2008 in a nationally televised hearing. The charges centered on his repeated denials that he used steroids and human growth hormone during a 24-year career.",
      "In that 2008 hearing, Clemens told Congress that \"no matter what we discuss here today, I'm never going to have my name restored.\"",
      "He was denied election to the Hall for 10 straight years by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, with his final ballot appearance coming in 2022, his last year of eligibility under the traditional rules.",
      "However, they are now in the Contemporary Baseball Era player ballot, which according to the Hall \"features candidates whose primary contribution to the game came since 1980.\"",
      "The Hall in 2022 restructured its veterans committees for the third time in 12 years, setting up panels to consider the contemporary era from 1980 on as well as the classic era. The contemporary baseball era holds separate ballots for players and another for managers, executives and umpires.",
      "Each committee meets every three years. Contemporary managers, executives and umpires will be considered in December 2026, classic era candidates in December 2027 and contemporary era players again in December 2028.",
      "The contemporary committee features 16 members, including Hall of Fame players Ferguson Jenkins, Jim Kaat, Juan Marichal, Tony P\u00e9rez, Ozzie Smith, Alan Trammell and Robin Yount. They will be joined by former major league general managers Kim Ng, Doug Melvin, Tony Reagins and Terry Ryan, and media members Tyler Kepner and Jayson Stark of The Athletic and historian Steve Hirdt, the Hall said Tuesday.",
      "Owners Mark Attanasio of the Milwaukee Brewers and Arte Moreno of the Los Angeles Angels also are on the committee that gathers Sunday at the winter meetings in Orlando, Florida.",
      "Each voter can select up to three candidates, and 75% or more of ballots are needed for election. Anyone chosen will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 26 along with players voted in by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, whose balloting will be announced on Jan. 20.",
      "Under a change announced by the Hall last March, any candidate on the ballot who receives fewer than five votes will not be eligible for that committee's ballot during the next three-year cycle. A candidate who is dropped, later reappears on a ballot and again receives fewer than five votes would be barred from future ballot appearances.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:56:46 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's claims of a historic multitrillion-dollar investment surge don't match federal data or the administration's own numbers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.",
      "\"Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States \u2014\u00a0 or committed to invest \u2014 in one year,\" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, \"In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.\"",
      "But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion \u2014 an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.",
      "The administration's own list of major investments \"made possible by President Trump's leadership\" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.",
      "The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.",
      "\"President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.",
      "Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.",
      "Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden",
      "The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.",
      "The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.",
      "Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.",
      "The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.",
      "The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. In July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project with private financing, including the previously announced $1.7 billion investment.",
      "\"The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,\" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.",
      "The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.",
      "Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals",
      "Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets \u2014 not investments in the U.S.",
      "For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to \"generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,\" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.",
      "Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to \"more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030\" \u2014 a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.",
      "Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.",
      "Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned\u202fwhether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.",
      "History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.",
      "Current U.S. investment levels remain typical",
      "Federal data suggests that real investment spending \u2014 as opposed to announced commitments \u2014 remains roughly in line with last year's levels.",
      "Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.",
      "\"Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending \u2014 so new equipment, buildings and machinery \u2014 2025 is similar to 2024,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.",
      "But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.",
      "New foreign direct investment \u2014 the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects \u2014 also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.",
      "Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.",
      "\"He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",
      "This story has been updated with additional information from Invenergy.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 21:49:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The former officials said the FDA's plans to revamp how certain life-saving vaccines are handled would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
    "story": [
      "A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.",
      "The former officials said the agency's plans to revamp how life-saving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled \u2014 outlined in an internal FDA memo last week \u2014 would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
      "\"The proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job,\" the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The internal memo by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad hasn't been publicly released. The memo said a review \"found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination,\" multiple sources familiar with it told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle, the sources said. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "It went on to outline planned agency changes in handling those and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign.",
      "Among Prasad's plans were revising how yearly flu shot updates are handled and focusing more on \"the benefits and harms of giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" A common message of vaccine skeptics is that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that ingredients may build up to cause harm, although scientists say repeated research into those claims has turned up no concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, the former FDA leaders wrote that Prasad's claim about child deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines had been reported to a surveillance system that doesn't contain medical records or other information sufficient to prove a link \u2014 and that government scientists had carefully combed through those reports in previous years, reaching different conclusions. They also noted that \"substantial evidence\" shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce children's risk of severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\"The memo asserts, incorrectly, that 'we do not have reliable data' on the benefits of Covid vaccination in children,\" the former FDA officials wrote. \"Reasonable scientists should engage in open debate about how best to shape recommendations for children at lower risk for Covid-19, but substantial evidence shows that vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization in many children and adolescents.\"",
      "But the bigger picture, the former FDA leaders argued, is that the new proposals would reject long-standing science about how to evaluate vaccines being updated to better match virus strains, slow innovation to replace older vaccines with newer, potentially better ones, and make the process less transparent to the public.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Wednesday night, \"The fact these criticisms are coming from former FDA officials who opposed raising the bar for vaccine science confirms we are on the right track.\"",
      "Many doctors and public health experts have also expressed alarm about the memo.",
      "\"Vaccines save lives, period,\" Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement. \"It is a sad day when FDA creates confusion and mistrust without supplying evidence, spreading propaganda that makes lifesaving vaccines harder to access and that creates additional confusion and mistrust for the public.\"",
      "The FDA's planned vaccine changes come at a time when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 is seeking to broadly remake federal policies on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy already ousted a committee that advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and replaced it with handpicked members. And in August, he fired Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC chief over vaccine policy disagreements. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss hepatitis B vaccinations in newborns and other vaccine topics.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan deal on health care remains elusive in the Senate with a key vote on Affordable Care Act tax credits set for next week.",
      "\"The conversations continue,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday. \"I don't think at this point we have a clear path forward, I don't think the Democrats have a clear path forward \u2014 and they're the ones that are going to have to put forward their plan to get voted on next week.\"",
      "A group of Senate Democrats last month secured a vote to address expiring Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which were at the heart of the government shutdown fight, as part of the deal to reopen the government. That vote is set to occur next week, when Democrats will have the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice.",
      "Democrats could pursue a compromise position that stands a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance, or they could seek an extension that wouldn't pick up enough support from Republicans but would force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Millions of Americans are due to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket in the new year without action from Congress.",
      "Dwindling prospects for a bipartisan compromise",
      "Republicans have been critical of the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. But with premiums set to rise with the expiration of the tax credits, which help pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges, some GOP lawmakers have acknowledged a need for a short-term extension. And the planned vote next week puts pressure on Republicans to come together on a strategy.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday that there are some in the GOP conference who want to work with Democrats \"in a constructive way on something that could be a bipartisan solution, but that hasn't landed yet.\"",
      "Among the issues at the center of the impasse is the Hyde amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions. Thune called it a \"difficult, challenging\" issue for both sides. The majority leader told reporters Wednesday that \"our members are very committed, obviously, and with good reason, to ensuring that the Hyde protections apply to Obamacare policies.\"",
      "\"The Democrats clearly have a different view, and that has always been probably one of the biggest obstacles to getting a deal,\" Thune said. \"That one is a really challenging one.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"as long as Republicans are wedded to expanding Hyde, they can't even talk about anything else.\"",
      "On Democrats' position more broadly, the New York Democrat said Tuesday that \"we're willing to talk to anybody who's willing to lower costs,\" but he claimed \"the Republicans are in total disarray and have no plan.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a top progressive voice in the chamber, told reporters Tuesday that he wants a clean, multi-year extension of the tax credits, \"but I understand that's not likely to get 13 Republican votes.\"",
      "\"So yeah, I'm certainly open for a one-year extension, some restrictions on income,\" he said. \"But it just doesn't seem like Republicans are interested in anything. I mean, they might not even offer their own proposal because it appears that they can't even get 53 votes on anything related to extending these subsidies.\"",
      "Republicans work to coalesce around a strategy",
      "Thune said Senate Republicans had a \"robust discussion\" at their conference lunch meeting Tuesday and heard from two top committee chairs. But there was no apparent breakthrough. He said Republicans \"continue to coalesce\" around a health care solution, with a number of ideas percolating in recent weeks.",
      "Multiple Senate Republicans said after the lunch meeting that they expect that GOP leadership will put forward a bill alongside the Democrat-led ACA measure for Republicans to vote on if Democrats pursue a partisan approach, a move which would alleviate pressure on their conference. But Thune said until they know what the Democrats are planning to put forward, \"we won't probably have our strategy ready.\"",
      "Without a negotiated bipartisan approach, neither bill would be likely to get the votes needed to advance. And what that GOP legislation looks like remains to be seen.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, told reporters that \"if the Democrats want to keep working, we're willing to do that.\"",
      "\"If they say, 'nope, we want to have a vote,' we'll have a plan,\" Hoeven said. \"It's not finalized yet, but we'll obviously have something ready to go. We've got a lot of good ideas.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, has outlined his proposal aimed at lowering health care costs in recent weeks. His plan would take roughly the same amount of money that would be needed to extend the enhanced ACA tax credits and put that into health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans. The idea is that people would save on premiums by switching to the bronze plans, while they would also be able to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, unveiled another proposal ahead of the Thanksgiving break. Scott framed his bill as something that could drive down costs by giving people options. The proposal would create HSA-style accounts to pay for health insurance.",
      "\"Mine's pretty simple \u2014 if you like your Obamacare, keep your Obamacare,\" Scott told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Tuesday that he plans to pitch a proposal to effectively end taxes on health care costs. He said the idea would work in conjunction with \"some form of premium support.\"",
      "Thune also lauded an idea that would allow individuals to sign up for \"association\" health care coverage, in which small businesses and the self-employed collectively purchase coverage to lower costs. The proposal would allow companies like Costco and Walmart to offer health policies across state lines.",
      "\"I think it's a great idea, something we've been for for a long time,\" Thune said. \"It's always been resisted by Democrats, but buying across state lines, allowing people to join larger groups, to get into the group market, out of the individual market \u2026 That is a way that you could significantly address the issue of cost and affordability.\"",
      "Waiting on the White House",
      "The debate within the Senate GOP is happening in anticipation of input from the White House. Last week, reports indicated that the White House was planning to propose a two-year extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits with new limits. But the proposal seemed to dissipate after GOP lawmakers resisted, and President Trump told reporters he prefers a plan to give money directly to people over insurance companies and would rather not extend the subsidies.",
      "\"Somebody said I want to extend them for two years, I don't want to extend them for two years,\" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"I'd rather not extend them at all. It may be, some kind of an extension may be necessary to get something else done, because the Unaffordable Care Act has been a disaster.\"",
      "As the president's advisers were drafting a plan to continue the subsidies for an additional two years, Speaker Mike Johnson had told the White House in a phone call with senior administration officials that most House Republicans have little interest in extending the Affordable Care Act's enhanced subsidies, sources familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett outlined the back and forth on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes people leak pre-decisional things that are confidential and pre-decisional,\" Hassett said. \"And I think that somebody did that, and then it rolled back because it hadn't been through the whole process, but President Trump has been clear that he's very concerned about the cost of health care.\"",
      "Hassett predicted that \"people are going to work this out\" before Christmas. He added that the White House has \"a solution for cost-sharing, and the Democrats have an alternative.\"",

    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:20:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Samples collected from the asteroid Bennu are continuing the shed light on the origins of the solar system and how life developed on Earth, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued after a powerful solar flare over the weekend.",
      "The solar flare peaked at 9:49 p.m. EST on Sunday, November 30, said NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which constantly monitors the sun. The flare was classified as X1.9 flare, the space agency said. X-classes are the most intense kind of flare. The eruption came from a newly emerging sunspot region.",
      "The flare briefly knocked out radio communications across Australia and parts of southeast Asia on Tuesday, Space.com reported.",
      "A coronal mass ejection, or CME, also occurred. During CMEs, solar material and magnetic fields erupt from the sun. CMEs and solar flares are similar, but they are distinct phenomena, NASA said.",
      "Flares and CMEs can impact radio communications, power grids and navigation signals, NASA said. They can also pose a risk to spacecraft and astronauts. When CMEs reach Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center.",
      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued for Thursday, December 4. The CME is not expected to reach Earth, but can still have minor impacts including \"manageable effects to some technological infrastructure,\" NOAA said. There is some unpredictability in the forecast, NOAA noted, so the storm could arrive as early as December 3.",
      "The Northern Lights may be visible in northern and upper states between New York and Idaho. Weather forecasts, including a powerful winter storm, may limit the chances of seeing the phenomenon.",
      "Scientists may see more space weather activity between December 1 and December 5, NOAA said, as the sun's newly emerging sunspot region rotates to face the Earth. The sunspot, labeled AR4299, is where the recent flare and CME originated from.",

    "summary": "Tilly Norwood is unlike any other aspiring TV or movie star: Tilly is entirely generated by artificial intelligence. What might that mean for the media industry?",
    "story": [
      "At the dawn of this century, Al Pacino starred in \"S1m0ne,\" a satire about a down-on-his-luck director who creates a computer-generated \"star\" that conquers Hollywood. Fast forward nearly 25 years, and it appears that real life has caught up with the movies, with the introduction of an AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood.",
      "News of an AI actress triggered a bit of a Hollywood freak-out about that timeless worry of who gets the part, from Whoopi Goldberg (\"Bring it on, because you can always tell them from us\"), to Emily Blunt (\"Good Lord, we're screwed\").",
      "Tilly's creator, Eline van der Velden, says she did not expect the backlash: \"No, not at all. But at the same time, I had created her to resonate internationally, right? I had created her to become a global superstar.\"",
      "Van der Velden, herself a former actor and comedienne, aimed high because she thinks generative AI is ready for its closeup \u2013 saving money, and adding creativity. \"I was just trying to educate those industry individuals at that time about what's possible,\" she said.",
      "Bringing Tilly to life took van der Velden's team some 2,000 iterations. Then, she began to teach her to act. She showed us some early iterations of Tilly emoting. \"We were starting to try different emotions with her,\" she said. \"Here we did some tests. We didn't think the acting was very good at all.\"",
      "\"It wasn't up to your standards?\" I asked.",
      "\"It was not up to my standards at all!\"",
      "In an interview this past July with the British publication Broadcast International, van der Velden made the provocative statement, \"We want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that's the aim of what we're doing.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson of the AI genre,\" she told us. \"I think that was what was missed. There was a lot of misinformation. She's not meant to take real acting jobs in the traditional film and TV industry. She's meant to stay in her own AI genre, and that's where we want her to stay.\"",
      "Still, she says her firm has fielded requests for Tilly to appear in a film opposite real actors. \"We have said no to any offers,\" van der Velden said.",
      "\"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up\"",
      "Sean Astin is the president of SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, where Tilly Norwood has struck a nerve about the state of AI. Asked what Tilly represents to him, Astin replied, \"Avatar and character seem like fair labels. Actress, not so much. She \u2013 she? It? \u2013 simply will not replace our people.\"",
      "He says right now in Hollywood artificial intelligence feels like a tsunami: \"The onslaught of AI products and AI technology and its uses is, it's overwhelming. I would just as soon \u2013 as citizens and as a union \u2013 that we surf the wave, that we surf the wave of incoming stuff.\"",
      "For the union, AI protections were a major point of contention in the 2023 strike, and Astin says safeguarding a performer's name, image and likeness from being harvested without compensation is a top priority going forward. \"Eline has every right to use open source, publicly available, legal information to build her creative things,\" he said. \"My issue and our company's issue is with the companies that design those systems and scrape the internet and ingest them. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "Astin applauds producers who are trying to push the creative envelope using AI. But, he adds, \"There's a difference between pushing the envelope and tearing it up. If you push the envelope, you say, 'Hey, how can human-centered artistry collaborate with this technology to achieve some communication that feels good to an audience?' And then there's like, 'Oh, by the way, we think it's cheaper, easier, and you know, we don't want to hire you as an actor.'\"",
      "\"Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\"",
      "Already, AI-generated scenes have appeared in TV series like Amazon's \"House of David.\" There are AI commercials, and over the summer, an AI model appeared in an ad in Vogue magazine for the first time.",
      "For producers, facing ballooning production budgets, AI has triggered a range of emotions. Former entertainment executive Kevin Reilly explains: \"Excitement, confusion, fear, trying to figure out how to use this. Is it a friend, or is it a foe?\" he said. \"It is, in my opinion, very much a friend. It is the most transformative thing that's happened maybe in the history of Man.\"",
      "Reilly is now something of an AI evangelist. He's the new CEO of Kartel.ai, a Beverly Hills startup that makes AI videos and ad campaigns. \"Everything comes with a downside,\" he said. \"But that is not the reason to just categorically be fearful of this.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of this is driven by studios and streaming platforms and brands wanting to just save money?\"",
      "\"Yeah, I think it's not necessarily, 'Hey, we wanna save money,'\" said Reilly. \"It's that the bottom line \u2013 you know, they are businesses.\"",
      "And for businesses, the creative upside can be extraordinary. Kartel wanted to show off a bit, and put generative engineer Fillip Isgro in the driver's seat. He showed us a concept for a coffee commercial, Cup of Jo. The ad featured multiple versions of \u2026 me! It was a little jarring.",
      "He began with an old-fashioned storyboard, building an AI world directed by a human. \"What does the coffee shop look like? What does the logo look like? And finally, what do you look like? With your permission, we went on your Instagram and we collected all of your photos.\"",
      "That's all he needed to generate my face. And with just a few commands, Cup of Jo went global, with images of Jo's Coffee Shop on a barge in the middle of the ocean; on a volcano in Hawaii; and in the Alps.",
      "\"The next step in our journey is, we bring it to life,\" Isgro said. \"We actually bring motion into our stills. I just whip out my iPhone, I record who I need to, and then I can just instantly get the character doing the thing that I need them to do.\"",
      "The result: a flashy new ad created in just a couple of days, using no ad agency, no locations, and none of my time.",
      "\"Imagine having to go and shoot that. You don't get that flexibility\" in a traditional ad, Isgro said. \"And it's a very planned thing. You have to stick to scripts, and that's it. But in this world, we can iterate indefinitely without repercussion.\"",
      "It's the story of our time: the tug of war between artificial intelligence (\"This tech is here. It's not gonna go anywhere. How can we use it as a force for good?\" asks Eline van der Velden) and humanity (\"Artificial intelligence will never replace us, ever,\" says Sean Astin) that, for now, is something of a cliffhanger.",

      "In a statement issued Friday, the commission accused X of using its 'blue checkmark' in a way that deceives users. Anyone can pay to get the verification, making it hard for users to judge the authenticity of the accounts they engage with on the social media platform, the EU said. This could expose users to scams and \"other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" the commission noted.",
      "The European Commission also took aim at X's ads repository, which it said fails to meet accessibility requirements under the DSA. Internet platforms in the EU are required to provide a database of all the digital advertisements they have carried, with details such as who paid for them and the intended audience. That goal is to help researchers detect scams, fake ads and coordinated influence campaigns.",
      "X has 60 days to tell the European Commission how it plans to address the group's concerns.",

      "Google's annual \"Year in Search\" report is a window into what Americans have been thinking about over the past year, from breaking news to pop culture trends.",
      "Kirk was the top search overall in the U.S. The 31-year-old right-wing political activist and influential voice for young conservatives died in September after he was shot in the neck during a Turning Point USA event in Utah Valley University. His wife, Erika, who took over as chairman and CEO of Turning Point USA, was also named one of the top-searched people on Google.",
      "Erika Kirk made headlines when she forgave her husband's killer during remarks at his memorial service, which drew thousands to State Farm Stadium in Arizona, including the president. She will join CBS for a one-hour town hall event moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss on Saturday, Dec. 13, at 8 p.m. ET on CBS. The appearance comes days after the anticipated release of \"Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,\" a guide to recharging and connecting with your faith and family, written by her late husband.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-smartphone-app-sanchar-saathi-government-install-order-revoked-privacy-uproar/",
    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:44:21 -0500",
    "summary": "India's government, amid an uproar over privacy, has revoked an order quietly issued to smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run security app.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors after presenting the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Saturday, hailing the slate of artists as \"legendary in so many ways.\"",
      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

    "story": [
      "Another stabbing on a commuter train in Charlotte, North Carolina, has drawn the attention of President Trump amid his administration's crackdown on immigration.",
      "The incident occurred on Friday after 33-year-old Oscar Solarzano allegedly entered the Charlotte Area Transit System's Blue Line light rail train and got into an argument with another passenger, according to authorities. The victim was in critical but stable condition, police said.",
      "\"It does not appear this was a random act of violence, but an altercation between two individuals that escalated,\" a transit spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday posted to Truth Social, reacting to the incident, \"Another stabbing by an Illegal Migrant in Charlotte, North Carolina. What's going on in Charlotte? Democrats are destroying it, like everything else, piece by piece!!!\"",
      "Solarzano was arrested nearby by Charlotte-Mecklenburg police on Friday evening and taken into custody, officials said. In court records from Solarzano's release hearing, a court appearance where a judge determines if a suspect can leave jail before trial, a magistrate noted Solarzano is undocumented and \"has been deported previously.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin on Saturday said Solarzano is being charged with attempted first-degree murder \"after he stabbed a victim with a large knife.\" She also confirmed that Solarzano had been removed from the U.S. twice.",
      "Solarzano was ordered to remain in jail, according to court documents. It's unclear whether he has entered a plea.",
      "Before federal immigration authorities descended on Charlotte last month as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, Mr. Trump was among those who raised concerns about public safety in the city following the deadly stabbing of 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on the light rail in August.",
      "Decarlos Brown Jr., a U.S. citizen with a history of mental illness, was arrested for the killing. He had been arrested more than a dozen times and was released earlier this year by a magistrate on a misdemeanor count without any bond. The death led North Carolina lawmakers to approve a criminal justice package dubbed \"Iryna's Law,\" limiting bail and seeking to ensure more defendants undergo mental health evaluations.",
      "In a statement on Saturday, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, who opposed Mr. Trump sending federal agents to the city, said the city has \"invested heavily\" in public safety efforts in light of recent incidents.",
      "\"There are several aspects of public safety that are outside of the city's jurisdiction, including immigration policy and enforcement, but we will continue to focus on public safety and ensuring a safe and vibrant community,\" Lyles said.",
      "Despite local opposition and Charlotte's declining crime rates, Trump administration officials targeted the Democrat-run city, saying it was primarily focused on apprehending immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also had criminal histories and posed a threat to public safety.",
      "According to an internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by CBS News last month, fewer than one-third of the individuals arrested by Border Patrol during the Trump administration's recent\u00a0immigration enforcement crackdown\u00a0in Charlotte were classified as criminals.",

Southwest made a $12 million payment in 2024 and a second $12 million payment earlier this year.

      "The fine stemmed from a winter storm in December 2022 that paralyzed Southwest's operations in Denver and Chicago and then snowballed when a crew-rescheduling system couldn't keep up with the chaos. Ultimately the airline canceled 17,000 flights and stranded more than 2 million travelers.",
      "The Biden administration determined that Southwest had violated the law by failing to help customers who were stranded in airports and hotels, leaving many of them to scramble for other flights. Many who called the airline's overwhelmed customer service center got busy signals or were stuck on hold for hours.",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:03:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Rep. Ilhan Omar told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that if allegations of a connection between tax dollars and terrorism are true, \"that is a failure of the FBI and our court system.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar said Sunday that any link between allegations of fraud by members of the Somali community and terrorism would be a \"failure of the FBI\" amid calls to investigate a series of multimillion-dollar alleged pandemic fraud schemes in Minnesota.",
      "During the Biden administration in 2022, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States,\" which revolved around a welfare program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "The Treasury Department said last week that it will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. And House Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation last week into Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the fraud cases.",
      "Omar said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that she's \"pretty confident\" that the alleged link to terrorism is a false claim, citing prosecutions and sentences that have already taken place.",
      "\"If there was a linkage in the money that they have stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out,\" Omar said.",
      "The Minnesota Democrat said the accusations have been around for many years. But she added, \"if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know.\"",
      "\"And we want those people prosecuted,\" Omar said. \"And we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.\"",
      "Minnesota is home to the largest Somali-American population in the U.S. The vast majority of the foreign-born Somali population have U.S. citizenship, according to 2024 Census Bureau figures. The bulk of those charged in the fraud scheme were of Somali descent, though the founder of the group, called Feeding Our Future, is White and was convicted at trial earlier this year.",
      "The president has blamed the fraud on the Somali people, while saying in recent days that Somali immigrants do \"nothing but complain.\" He called Omar, and \"friends\" of the Minnesota congresswoman who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager, \"garbage.\"",
      "Omar called the president's comments \"disgusting.\"",
      "\"These are Americans that he is calling garbage, and we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community, and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me,\" Omar said. \"I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric and this level of dehumanizing can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the President.\"",
      "Omar said the fraud scheme also has an impact on Somalis, \"because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota.\"",
      "\"We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen,\" she said. \"And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're, you know, we're also, as Minnesotans, as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said \"this is part of the continued cleanup.\"",
      "\"A lot of money has been transferred from the individuals who committed this fraud,\" Bessent said, alleging that individuals charged had donated to Gov. Tim Walz, Omar and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison. He said that money \"has gone overseas, and we are tracking that both to the Middle East and to Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.\"",
      "Omar said she doesn't know what Bessent is referring to.",
      "\"We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved,\" she said. \"We sent that money back a couple of years ago, and actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the Secretary of [Agriculture] asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump took aim at Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democratic congressman from Texas whom he recently pardoned, in a Truth Social post.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump slammed Rep. Henry Cuellar on Sunday for what he called \"a lack of loyalty\" because the Democratic congressman announced his plans to run again as a Democrat, rather than switch to the Republican party, in his next bid to represent Texas in the U.S. House.",
      "In a social media post, Mr. Trump suggested that he may have expected Cuellar to help Republicans maintain their slim majority in the House during the 2026 midterm elections after the congressman was granted clemency.",
      "Cuellar is a Democrat and has represented Texas' 28th district as a member of that party since 2005. Mr. Trump recently pardoned him and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, who were both indicted last year on federal bribery charges. Their two daughters, Christina and Catherine, had sent Mr. Trump a letter in November asking that he pardon their parents.",
      "The president claimed the allegations against them resulted from political targeting by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden, writing in multiple Truth Social posts about attacks on Cuellar from within the Democratic Party over his views on immigration and border security.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump issued the pardons, Cuellar announced his decision to launch another congressional campaign, still as a Democratic candidate. In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0on Sunday about Cuellar, Mr. Trump slammed the congressman for not switching parties in the wake of the president's favor.",
      "\"Only a short time after signing the Pardon, Congressman Henry Cuellar announced that he will be 'running' for Congress again, in the Great State of Texas (a state where I received the highest number of votes ever recorded!), as a Democrat, continuing to work with the same Radical left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison - And provably still do!\" wrote Mr. Trump, characterizing Cuellar's move as \"such a lack of LOYALTY.\"",
      "\"Next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!\" the president added.",
      "Cuellar discussed the pardon on Sunday during an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" saying he believed the indictment against him and his wife was an act of retaliation by Biden administration officials over his criticism of the former president's border policies.",
      "\"I now look at all the evidence, and looking at everything, definitely I feel that I was weaponized, that he [former President Biden] used the department to go after myself and my family,\" said Cuellar. \"And I'll tell you something, if they want to come after me because I was a critic about open borders, that's one thing. But you don't bring the family in. You just don't do that.\"",
      "CBS News contacted Cuellar's office for comment on Mr. Trump's Truth Social post but did not receive an immediate response.",
      "A party switch would have been an unexpected bonus for Republicans after the GOP-run Legislature redrew the state's congressional districts this year at Mr. Trump's behest. Cuellar's South Texas district, which includes parts of metro San Antonio, was not one of the Democratic districts that Republicans changed substantially.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the president's prediction then correct?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it's actually been a very strong holiday season, and the \u2013 you know, we've seen across the \u2013 all the income cohorts thus far. And so there's nothing to say that there are two dolls, instead of 30 dolls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president was wrong to predict lower numbers of purchases and higher prices?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The economy has been better than we thought. We've had the 4 \u2013 4 percent GDP growth in a couple of quarters. We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3 percent real GDP growth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the maker of Tonka trucks, their CEO said it's going to cost 40 bucks for their toys right now because of tariffs and inflation. It was 30 bucks the year before that, 25.",
      "Prices in the toy space are accelerating, and people are feeling that.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, inflation is a composite number, and it's roughly the same year over year. And if we were to look at all imported goods, imported goods inflation is below the inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The inflation number, you mean the\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: The PC \u2013 the PCE number, which is about 2.9 percent. Imported goods inflation is about 1.8. It's the service economy that's generating inflation, which actually has nothing to do with tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we hear from, for example, the president, when he says that affordability is a con job by Democrats, that seems to just not be resonating with consumers that have been polled by CBS.",
      "Sixty percent of Americans polled by this network told us President Trump makes prices and inflation sound better than they really are. And his approval rating in the economy is now down to 36 percent in our latest poll. On inflation, approval is even lower, at 32 percent.",
      "Don't you need to show that you feel the pain?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, I think the president's frustrated by the media coverage of what's going on and\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, this is the polling of average Americans.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, no, but \u2013 yes, but I think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 the average Americans, they are hearing a lot from media coverage.",
      "And I will tell you that affordability has two components. There is inflation and then there is real incomes. Real incomes are up about 1 percent. And what we're not going to do is say that Americans don't know what they're feeling. We've been working on it every day.",
      "I was on your show on March talking about affordability. The \u2013 we've made a lot of gains, but, remember, we've got this embedded inflation from the Biden years, where mainstream media, whether it was Greg Ip at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" toxic Paul Krugman at \"New York Times,\" or former Vice Chair Alan Blinder, all said it was a vibecession, the American people don't know how good they have it.",
      "Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or overregulation, that we are now seeing the \u2013 this affordability problem, and I think, next year, we're going to move on to prosperity because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do think there is an affordability problem?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do believe there's an affordability problem?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Oh, I \u2013 I think the Biden administration created a terrible\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but now. We're nearly 12 months in. You said the president would own the economy at this point.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 yes, I said that the Biden administration created the worst inflation in 50 years, and maybe, for working Americans, the worst inflation of all time.",
      "And we have pulled that number down, that Strategas Research does something called the Common Man index. Under Biden, the accumulated inflation number, as measured by CPI, was about 20 percent. Their index showed 35. This year, for the first time, the Common Man index is below the inflation index because the basket of goods for working Americans, food, gasoline, rent, is coming down.",
      "So I wrote an essay March 12, 2024, and it talked about the three I's, immigration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 interest rates and inflation.",
      "Immigrant \u2013 mass, unfettered immigration depressed wages, caused housing prices to go up. The president has closed the border. That is fixed. Interest rates have come down. The bond market just had the best year since 2020. And now we are working on inflation. And I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, grocery prices are up nearly 3 percent compared to last September.",
      "The president seems to be acknowledging that grocery prices, or at least beef prices, are a challenge, because he put out this order just yesterday saying they're going to investigate corporate price gouging for high beef prices.",
      "Isn't suing the food companies the same thing the Biden administration did, and it didn't really work? How is this any different?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, nothing the \u2013 nothing the Biden administration did worked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why are you doing it?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And the \u2013 because this isn't the same thing. If they \u2013 if they had done this, if they'd done it properly, we'd be in a different spot. And, like, beef is one component. Thanksgiving Turkey was down 16 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know you are working on the trade front and for American farmers and the prices that they are experiencing, that they're feeling a pinch about not having a market to sell into, necessarily.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Not \u2013 not anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the agricultural secretary just said that the president is going to announce a bridge payment for farmers this week to give them short-term relief while you're working on these \u2013 finalizing these trade packages.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, the \u2013 the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are these low crop prices, and the soybeans in particular.",
      "I know you spoke with China's vice premier Friday. Are they going to speed purchasing up?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, they're not going to speed purchasing up. They're in the cadence that we agreed to. Soybean prices are up about 12 or 15 percent since the agreement with the Chinese. They are going to buy 12.5 million metric tons.",
      "But, Margaret, I'm involved in the agricultural industry. I run a soybean farm, and I can tell you\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own one. You invest in it.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own or invest a soybean farm.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And people in my family go out and work on it. I actually just divested it this week as part of the \u2013 my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business.",
      "But I probably know more about any treasury secretary than \u2013 about agriculture since the 1800s. And I can tell you that what farmers need is certainty. And we have put that in place with this trade deal, 12.5 million metric tons this year, 25 million metric tons for the next three years for soybeans, also sorghum, the \u2013 and lumber.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, those purchases, just to clarify, those will be this year? Because I heard you say this past week that some of the purchases wouldn't take place until February.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, for the \u2013 for the season, so the crop year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The season year?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "But why \u2013 if everything's fine, then why do farmers need a bridge payment from the Agricultural Department?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would farmers need a bridge payment from the Agriculture Department then?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Because these prices haven't come in, because the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations.",
      "And we are going to create \u2013 create this bridge, because, again, agriculture is all about the future. You've got to start financing for planning next year, when things will be very good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that was announced this past week, the Trump Accounts, and building on this concept.",
      "S, parents, as I understand, are going to be able to open these accounts via the Treasury for their kids. They're tax-deferred investment vehicles to U.S. citizen children under 18, get $1,000 from the government for babies born between 2025 and 2028.",
      "So there are going to be restrictions on what the money can be used for, college tuition or their first house. Is that right?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No, it is, the federal government for children born in the period you just described, is going to put $1,000 into these Trump Accounts. It will be invested in a widely diversified, low-cost index, and then it will be available\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the stock market, in an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, in essence, it is a trust fund. It is a piece of the American economy for every child, and they will be able to take it out when they're 18, or they can convert it to a more IRA-type program and keep it for their retirement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there won't be the restrictions I mentioned there about how they use the money?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So there was also a broadening of this, this past week, with the Dell Foundation\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 making a significant investment in the American children.",
      "So how is this going to work? Why structure it this way, instead of a savings account, for example?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a savings account just gets interest. This is the compounding power of the stock market.",
      "As Warren Buffett says, don't \u2013 don't bet against the American stock market. Don't bet against the economy. And this is going to bring a whole group of new investors into the market. We're going to couple it with a big amount of financial literacy, so that children understand what they own.",

      "The president told you, though, this week, to look into Somalis who \u2013 quote \u2013 \"ripped off that state for billions of dollars.\" He said they contribute nothing. What exactly are you investigating?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, to be clear, the initial fraud that was discovered by the IRS, for which I'm the acting commissioner, it was discovered by IRS Criminal Investigations Unit.",
      "This was not an endogenous thing that the state of Minnesota decided. We had to go in and clean up the mess for them, and this is part of the continued cleanup. A lot of money has been transferred the \u2013 from the individuals who committed this fraud, including those who donated to the government, governor, donated to Representative Omar and donated to A.G.

      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I really don't, and I don't think the secretary himself understands what he's referring to.",
      "We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved. We sent that money back a couple years ago. And, actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the secretary of ag asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was \u2013 just for our audience, the Biden era Justice Department called it the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and this was pocketing COVID era welfare funds, more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money that was stolen. It was pretty, pretty shocking.",
      "Of the 87 people charged, all but eight are of Somali descent, and that has added to the spotlight being put specifically on your community. Why do you think this fraud was allowed to get so widespread?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, I want to say, you know, this also has an impact on Somalis, because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota.",
      "We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen. And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're \u2013 you know, we're also, as Minnesotans, as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you think, though, that there was a failure by the Democratic state government to police itself? This is a brazen fraudulent activity here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes. And that is what I alluded to in my letter that I had sent to the secretary of ag was to see where things were going wrong. How can this amount of money disappear fraudulently without there being alarms being set off?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And it is something that, you know, we have to continue to investigate. We have to continue to ask those questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, one of the initial defenses by the organization at the heart of the fraud, Feeding Our Future, was to claim the probe was due to racism. Do you think that this was all about negligence, or that it was, like, political fear of alienating the Somali community?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: So, you have to remember that the woman who led the program is a Caucasian woman. And that was her way of making sure that this would continue to happen by using whatever rhetoric that was available to her.",
      "We do know that, when the money was stopped, they did sue the A.G. Attorney General Keith Ellison defended the department in that lawsuit. It was a judge that said it should continue, that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: \u2026 should continue to go out. And so this wasn't something that people were not looking at. There was always those \u2013 those alarms.",
      "And we will continue to understand where things might have gone wrong as these investigations continue and as these fraudsters are prosecuted and sent to jail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's going to have impact for your community, because we've already heard that the head of Medicare and Medicaid say they're going to have a new policy that applies to Minnesota. You heard the treasury secretary say they're investigating.",
      "But there's another thread here, because House Republicans and the treasury secretary just now talked about a link to terrorism, a possible link. He said they're just now beginning to look into it. How confident are you that that's a false claim?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: I'm pretty confident at the moment, because there are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced.",
      "If there was a linkage in that \u2013 the money that they had stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with \u2013 with these \u2013 with these charges.",
      "And so I do know that, for many years, this sort of like alarm that there is money being transferred through the airport in bags and going to terrorism has all \u2013 that accusation has always existed. There has never been here and there in those accusations.",

      "You met with Admiral Bradley, who commands Special Operations, as well. The president of the United States says he is open to this video being made public. Do you think it is essential that it become public, and are you confident it will be?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I think it's really important that this video be made public. It's not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which, you know, six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines.",
      "And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself. I know how the public is going to be react \u2013 is going to react, because I felt my own reaction.",
      "You know, I have spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context. And this video was profoundly shaking \u2013 shaken. And I think it's important for Americans to see it, because, look, there's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners.",
      "But I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under, just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was it \u2013 why did it shake you so much? What specifically was bothering you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, you know, and this is sort of the distinction, and there's a lot to unpack here about whether this is an authorized military action, which it is not, and right on down to whether these were legitimate \u2013 legitimate targets, and they were not.",
      "But let me go back to some of the reviews I have done of other lethal action. Oftentimes, when the Department of Defense takes a strike against a terrorist in Yemen or Pakistan or wherever, you watch a video of guys fully armed with AK-47s and sidearms and bombs and you name it, and they're on their way to do something terrible.",
      "And, in this instance, you may have had bad guys. I have no doubt that these guys were involved in the running of drugs. Now, whether they were running it to the United States or Europe is yet another question.",
      "But, in that instance, these guys were about to die. Had the United States just walked away, their little piece of wood would have gone under the waves.",
      "And as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing, because, under the law \u2013 and if you spent 15 minutes in law school, you know this \u2013 under the law, if someone has been struck and is \u2013 continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target.",
      "But if they are outside of combat, they are not, and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war. And these guys \u2013 and this is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were \u2013 were barely alive\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 much less engaging in hostilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the DOD Law of War Manual seems to hinge a lot of that on whether the person is wholly disabled from fighting, and that is where the secretary of defense has used language saying they're about to return to the fight.",
      "I'm going to play for you what Secretary Hegseth said at the Reagan Forum Saturday. He described what was happening with these four strikes on the alleged drug running boat.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): A couple hours later, I was told, hey, there had to be a reattack, because there were a couple folks that could still be in the fight, access to radios. There was a link-up point of another potential boat. Drugs were still there. They were actively interacting with them, had to take that reattack.",
      "I said: \"Roger. Sounds good.\"",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does what Hegseth said match what Admiral Bradley told you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was.",
      "But Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter, right? Remember, a week after this strike, there was a briefing for Congress. Why was a follow-up strike taken? The answer then, in the first week of September, was, a follow-up strike was taken because we needed to clear the wreckage so that there wasn't a danger to navigation.",
      "That was explanation number one. Explanation number two, right before we watched the video, was that they might have had a radio, and they might have been radioing a boat, and they might have been trying to recover the cocaine. And then, when you actually watch the video, you realize they don't have a radio. They're barely hanging on and not slipping beneath the waves.",
      "Then, we get this thing of how they're trying to right the boat. This was about a 40-foot boat that had just been hit with a massive piece of munitions. The conflagration probably destroyed everything in that boat. But, oh, maybe they might have swum under, gotten a radio, probably waterlogged, and radioed a boat that we're not even sure was there.",
      "So what we've had is a series of shifting explanations, oh, and including the fog of war, right? You know that Hegseth said, well, they took the second strike because of the fog of war.",
      "There was no fog. The military watched this boat very carefully \u2013 or I shouldn't even say boat. They watched the wreckage of the boat very carefully for a long period of time before they took the second strike.",
      "So, look, what Pete Hegseth says about this strike has zero credibility at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have confidence in Admiral Bradley?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, Admiral Bradley, this was my first meeting with him. Anyone who has ever worked with Admiral Bradley will tell you that he has a storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity. And, frankly, I have no reason to doubt that.",
      "What it raises is, what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that, if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired, when he works for a guy, Pete Hegseth, who wrote a book about how we shouldn't observe the laws of war, about how we need to be lethal, et cetera.",
      "It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that, if he weren't in that context, he might not do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said there were dozens of JAG lawyers observing all of this.",
      "On NBC this morning, he said all 11 people on the suspected drug smuggling boat were valid targets because the U.S. had high confidence they were part of a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "Do you know, were these high-level cartel members?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: No, of course not. Of course not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who were they? If the U.S. had high confidence\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You think Pablo Escobar back \u2013 well, first of all, first of all, let's be super clear about this.",
      "I don't think we knew the identities of any of the people in the boat. We might have known one or two. I don't know. But we certainly didn't know the identities of all 11. So nobody can characterize who all these people in any of these boats are.",
      "Now, I have enough confidence in the intelligence community to know that these are probably not guys out fishing or guys out, you know, being tourists and stuff. They are almost certainly running drugs. But this really matters, for the reason that you said.",
      "You know, if you're going to occupy an immense amount of the American Naval combat capability, you'd like to believe that you're going after the leaders, the cartel leaders\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 the \u2013 the kingpins, as they say.",
      "What we're doing here is, we're taking out the equivalent of the corner drug dealer in the Bronx, right, which, by the way, we should arrest the corner drug dealer in the Bronx. But the main reason we do that is to go after the kingpins, who, I promise you, are sitting in very comfortable villas right now in Colombia and Venezuela and everywhere, and watching as\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 much of the United States Navy is dedicated to taking out their lowest-level employees.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, this is an interesting question. I'm not at all convinced that there is a list of individuals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Now, this is what we do in the terrorism world, right? We designate high-value targets, we designate individuals.",
      "I have no reason to believe, and, in fact, I doubt that there are any individuals on a list anywhere. What we are doing \u2013 and I'm not going to get terribly specific about it, for obvious reasons, but what we are doing is we're picking up that this boat may be carrying drugs.",
      "And, to the administration, it doesn't matter who's in that boat, because - - and, look, they're saying this \u2013 because, if this boat is actually carrying drugs, then we can strike it. So, no, I don't think there is a list of individuals. I don't think we have any idea who precisely the individuals in these boats are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, as I understand it, these are signature strikes. This is an intelligence assessment based on signals intelligence saying this is who we believe these individuals to be.",
      "You know, some of these defenders of the Trump policy, like conservative columnists, have argued this is a precedent that was set by the Obama administration, which used signature strikes to kill alleged al Qaeda operatives, including a U.S. citizen at one point in Yemen.",
      "Do they have a point here that the drone policy has long allowed the killing of suspected criminals even without due process?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, there's a couple of really important distinctions.",
      "And you'll remember that the Obama administration, there was a lot of debate over whether signature strikes were OK or not. The most important distinction is that Congress authorized the war on terror. There was an authorization for the use of military force.",
      "The original sin of this whole thing \u2013 whether you think we should be wasting these guys or not, the original sin is that there is no congressional authorization. And then, in the Obama administration, they did have a list of individuals, right, often high-value targets, or HVTs, as we've referred to them.",
      "And then the question was, if you have an HVT, a high-value target, in a jeep in Northern Pakistan, and there's a guy next to that HVT, you know, how do you feel about taking that strike? You want to take down the high- value guy, but what about the young guy next to him? Well, the young guy has an AK-47, and the young guy was actually arranging for the transfer of explosives.",
      "You have that conversation, and then you decide whether you're going to take the strike, right? Now what we're doing \u2013 and, again, don't \u2013 I don't think that there's a list of individuals anywhere. They're just saying, that boat is carrying drugs. And even though military is not authorized by the Congress of the United States, we're taking out the boat, and we don't give a damn about who's on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and when you say \"I don't think,\" you are a member of the Gang of Eight, so, presumably, that information should be shared with you if it does exist.",
      "I want to ask you before I let you go. Signalgate, people may remember a few months ago that Trump \u2013 a Trump official added a journalist to an online group on Signal and shared advanced information of an upcoming bombing operation in Yemen.",
      "The Pentagon inspector general said Hegseth's actions risked operational security and violated federal laws on record keeping. Hegseth said he'd do the same thing all over again. Are your Republican colleagues saying in private that they have problems with what happened?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Absolutely, they're saying it in private.",
      "In public, of course, they're saying that it was perfect exoneration, right, that this report \u2013 and you read the key line, that this report that said that the secretary of defense put his troops and the mission at risk, that that's total exoneration.",
      "Now, I didn't hear the comment about: I would do this again.",
      "But if Pete Hegseth said he would do that again \u2013 and, look, again, you don't need to be a military expert to understand that sharing operational details before an operation is a really, really, really bad idea. If Pete Hegseth said that, that he would do that again, you know, he's just reinforcing what we all know, which is that he has absolutely no business in that job.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP, voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30-year-long policy regarding hepatitis B and newborns.",
      "They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is 2 months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes.",
      "Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours.",
      "For a child over the age of 5, if they develop hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95 percent chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity.",
      "For children between the ages of 1 and 5, they only have about a 25 to 50 percent chance of clearing the infection. So, about 25 to 50 percent of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of 1 and 5. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection.",
      "But, when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90 percent of newborns who become infected \u2013 and they'll become infected during delivery \u2013 will go on to develop chronic infection. They won't be able to clear the hepatitis B. And about 25 percent of them will die from sequelae of that infection either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer.",
      "So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's almost 99 percent effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2026",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point. The refrain is \u2013 oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States came out and said, this was very good because hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true.",
      "The fact is, there's a refrain that, if you just test the moms during \u2013 while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and, if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose.",
      "But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to. Many times, those test results aren't checked. And the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when, in fact, you do, of about 2 percent.",
      "That may not sound like a lot, but that 2 percent is going to translate into at least 1,000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated, in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And, again, 25 percent of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration.",
      "And, in this board decision, which the public could listen into, it was publicly broadcast, the board was handpicked by RFK Jr., who is a skeptic here of vaccines. From those who voted against the decision to delay, one of them who you heard at the top of the show said, the CDC is doing harm.",
      "Another said: \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\"",
      "Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is \u2013 the ACIP, by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda.",
      "And, look, the secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization or many of these childhood immunizations.",
      "And I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error, insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision-making to. And what we're seeing right now is, as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored.",
      "I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP.",
      "The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, and not ACIP.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So, I think, in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision-making body, and it's going to be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There will be certain states that \u2013 that adhere to it, but it will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you \u2013 this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run at the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines.",
      "You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator Dr. Vinay Prasad are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines.",
      "What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B. This is the vaccines of the future you're saying just won't be created.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "So, Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the Biologics Center, also oversees the vaccine division, he also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the chief medical officer of the agency and chief scientific officer \u2013 so he occupies a lot of positions \u2013 put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with or move away from what they call immunobridging studies.",
      "These are studies that allow you, for well-validated vaccines like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine \u2013 the new vaccine that's formulated against a circulating strain can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza.",
      "For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a longstanding practice. It's \u2013 we do it for flu vaccine. We do it in COVID certainly. We do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes, circulating bacterial serotypes.",
      "This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening.",
      "That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the COVID vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said \u2013 and asked, did it kill more healthy kids than it saved?",
      "The administration to date has not backed up information to back up these claims, but \u2013 but what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner? Because they're arguing they're doing this to help people.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next.",
      "So, the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the COVID vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what their concerns are related to the COVID vaccine itself.",
      "These are \u2013 every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data.",
      "Analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves, are very subjective and require the good will the people involved in that.",
      "And so I think that they should make that analysis public\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: \u2026 so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in it.",
      "They've already backed away from the 10. There's reporting from Endpoints that now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: \u2026 they're saying it's eight or nine. So, they're already backing away from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "And HHS said they will eventually make that data public. We'll look for it when it comes out.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jim-himes-pete-hegseth-boat-strikes-face-the-nation/",
    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 14:45:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that it's \"really important\" that video of the strikes \"be made public.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has \"zero credibility\" on the September strikes on an alleged drug boat, citing \"shifting explanations\" from the Pentagon for the second strike, which has drawn scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "Himes was among a small number of lawmakers who last week received briefings from military officials behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, which centered on the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, including the Sept. 2 follow-on strike that has become a flashpoint in Congress. The lawmakers were shown video of the second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, after the Washington Post reported a week earlier that a second attack killed two survivors of the initial strike.",
      "Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the briefing that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Himes urged that it's \"really important that this video be made public,\" noting that the interpretation of the video from lawmakers who were briefed \"broke down precisely on party lines.\"",
      "\"And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself,\" Himes said. \"I know how the public is going to react because I felt my own reaction.\"",
      "Himes said he's spent hours looking at videos of lethal action taken by the U.S., while noting that he was \"profoundly shaken\" by the video of the Sept. 2 strikes.",
      "\"There's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners, but I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under, just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing,\" Himes said.",
      "The strike was the first in the administration's campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Southern Hemisphere. Since then, the U.S. has conducted more than 20 strikes and killed more than 80 people. Even before the Post's report, the attacks had attracted scrutiny from lawmakers since the administration is conducting them without authorization from Congress. But the administration has argued that since it has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations, it has the legal authority to conduct the strikes, although the administration has not offered proof the vessels are being operated by drug cartels.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee who was also briefed last week, refuted Himes' characterization of the video last week. And on Sunday, he told \"Meet the Press\" that the survivors \"were not incapacitated in any way,\" adding that it was \"entirely appropriate to strike the boat again to make sure that its cargo was destroyed.\"",
      "Cotton said it appeared the individuals were \"sitting or standing on top of a capsized boat, they weren't floating helplessly in the water.\"",
      "\"I don't think it matters all that much what they were trying to do,\" Cotton said, adding that it looked at one point like they were trying to flip the boat back over.",
      "Himes responded to the comments on \"Face the Nation\" saying, \"as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing.\"",
      "\"If someone has been struck and continues to engage in hostilities \u2014 points a gun at you, has a gun \u2014 they may be a legitimate target, but if they are outside of combat, they are not and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war,\" Himes said. \"And these guys \u2014 and this is why the American people need to see this video \u2014 these guys were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.\"",
      "The lawmakers were briefed by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, who was leading the mission and whom Hegseth has said made the decision to strike the boat again.",
      "Himes said people who have worked with Bradley describe him as having had a \"storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity.\" But he said what the incident raises \"is what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired.\"",
      "\"It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that if he weren't in that context, he might not do,\" Himes added.",
      "Hegseth described his own role in the Sept. 2 strikes at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday, saying he was told there had to be a \"reattack\" because there were \"a couple folks who could still be in the fight,\" citing possible access to radio, drugs still present and a \"linkup point of another potential boat.\"",
      "\"I said, 'roger, sounds good,'\" Hegseth said. \"From what I understood then and what I understand now, I fully support that strike. I would have made the same call myself.\"",
      "Asked by Brennan whether the secretary's statement matched what he was told in the briefing, Himes said \"there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was.\"\"But Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter,\" Himes added.",
      "Hegseth won't commit to releasing video of second strike on alleged drug boat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscript: Rep.

      "By the end of the three-week search, investigators found as many as 27 bones and a human skull spread across 35 acres of forest. It was confirmed through DNA testing and dental identification that the bones were Molly's. Mires believes that Molly's killer most likely picked Whiskey Hill because of its hidden location.",

      "Det. Dan Richard: That's a theory.",
      "In fact, in the early days of the investigation, search dogs did follow Molly's scent from the pond, leading up to the cemetery.",
      "Kathy Curran: You don't just stumble upon Comins Pond. That's why the person who killed Molly Bish \u2026 had to have watched her. And they had to have had a plan.",
      "But there were still so many unanswered questions: like, why was the first aid kit left open? Kathy Curran believes that Molly's abductor may have pretended to be injured.",
      "Kathy Curran: And then someone either forced her or threatened her \u2026 to get her up that hill because she, she's athletic. \u2026 She's not going to go easily.",
      "Then in May 2004, four years after Molly disappeared, D.A. John Conte called for a grand jury to be convened.",

      "And they were telling police conflicting stories about what happened in the hours before and after Molly went missing.",
      "The grand jury transcripts are sealed so it is not known whom the investigators actually questioned, but they would later clear Steven Lukas as a person of interest. After two long years, in December 2006, the grand jury was dismissed without an indictment.",
      "Heather Bish: It was disappointing \u2026 it was incredibly disappointing.",
      "Just weeks after the grand jury was dismissed, John Conte retired, and Joe Early Jr. took over as Worcester District Attorney. He says the grand jury was used as an investigative tool to preserve witnesses' testimony.",
      "D.A. Joe Early: You get 'em right in. You get 'em under oath and there's a criminal penalty if they lie in the grand jury. \u2026 and they can't say later, I didn't say that because it's right there. .. And that is something that helps us get cases beyond a reasonable doubt and prove guilt.",

      "Lt. Shawn Murphy: He didn't have much to say to me but I attempted. And so have, so have other investigators as well.",
      "Stanger was convicted of murdering his girlfriend and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. In 2012, State Police went down to Florida again to search Stanger's trailer.",
      "Det. Shawn Murphy: We did execute a search warrant at his residence with our law enforcement partners. And we did take items.",
      "Detective Murphy says the items were tested for DNA to see if they could be connected to Molly.",
      "Det. Shawn Murphy: We've tested and continue to test and move forward.",
      "But there was not enough evidence to make him an official suspect. And then, in 2011 a private investigator came to Heather with a new tip about a man named Gerald Battistoni.",
      "Heather Bish: He had actually raped a woman in the woods where Molly was found. His ex-wife had a white car that she reported he was driving in Warren the day Molly disappeared.",
      "Heather says she took this tip to the State Police who have confirmed that Battistoni, who died in prison in 2014, was on their radar along with many others.",
      "Det. Dan Richard: There are times \u2026 you could say this person's really good for this. This person's really good for that. That's not how you solve a crime. You know, you have to have the evidence to support it.",
      "Finally in 2021 \u2014 21 years after Molly disappeared \u2014 it looked like investigators had enough evidence. The District Attorney's Office officially named a person of interest.",

      "Erin Moriarty: Was he familiar with the area?",
      "Kathy Curran: He was, he was familiar with the area. \u2026 He was from the area. He had access to a white car.",
      "Kathy Curran: And when you compare the photo of him smoking the cigarette to the sketch \u2026 you can see a resemblance there.",
      "And just like the sketch, Sumner was photographed smoking with his left hand. D.A. Joe Early Jr. says Sumner, who died in 2016, had been well known to investigators working the Bish case for years.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What made Frank Sumner rise to that top to actually be called a suspect?",
      "D.A. Joe Early Jr.: Information that came in \u2026 some dots that were connected.",
      "Although tight-lipped about the details, the Worcester D.A.'s office was confident that Sumner was a viable suspect and planned to compare his DNA to DNA found at the crime scenes. But as it turned out, they couldn't obtain Sumner's DNA. Sumner had been cremated and his DNA had never been submitted to the national CODIS database.",
      "Heather Bish: I don't know who dropped the ball. But somebody dropped the ball \u2026",
      "So authorities traveled to Ohio to get DNA from his son, Frank Sumner Jr. He was serving time in prison for robbery.",
      "Heather Bish: And so we waited and we waited cause they said \u2026 we're going to, you know, do some DNA analysis.",
      "Heather, who had started that TikTok months earlier, reached out to her followers to see if she could drum up more evidence.",
      "Heather says it took investigators about a year before they finally told her the results of the DNA testing.",
      "Heather Bish: It was inconclusive.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you mean inconclusive? Was he eliminated from the DNA?",
      "Heather Bish: I don't know what that means.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Oh, you don't \u2014",
      "Heather Bish: And they won't tell me.",
      "Heather wonders if authorities who collected discarded cigarettes and other evidence at Comins Pond even have a viable sample of the killer's DNA.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you have enough DNA that you could do genetic genealogy and have you done any?",
      "D.A. Joe Early Jr.: I can't speak to the DNA. \u2026 I can speak in this way. We continue to test. \u2026 And we've gotten well over a hundred, uh, pieces of information tested and we continue to test.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You know that the Bishes have been frustrated. They don't feel they're getting enough information from your office. They wanna know is the DNA being preserved properly, what kind of DNA?",
      "D.A. Joe Early Jr.: As a general rule of thumb, no matter what family it is, the Bishes, uh, other families that we have, we just don't share the information because \u2026 someone might say something they just shouldn't say and it can compromise the entire case.",
      "However, he says DNA is just one piece of the puzzle.",
      "D.A. Joe Early Jr.: This isn't just a DNA case. There's a \u2014 a lot of investigation that's been done. \u2026 We need a little bit more. I'm not going to say what it is \u2026 But we need a little bit more to get where we want\u2014 need to get to name a person as the per \u2014 as a defendant in this case.",
      "But Heather says she's losing faith in the investigators.",
      "HEATHER BISH (TikTok): It's really a sad situation to be a victim family member in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.",
      "Investigator Shawn Murphy says he understands Heather's frustration.",
      "Lt. Shawn Murphy: Heather is a fierce advocate for her sister and her family, and I wouldn't have it any other way. And I have no problem being held accountable by Heather and I'm happy that she holds me accountable.",

And my father\u2014lovable but imposing, a strapping six feet three inches tall with a thick, bristly mustache and a rumbling Sergeant Schultz accent that frightened my friends half to death\u2014loved to tell stories. His family had moved to Hawaii from Germany when he was a child, but his strange way of pronouncing words never quite disappeared. Our family dogs, Nase and Scheu, were anointed with German names, a nod to his heritage, but there wasn't much else he divulged that would give us a feel for his formative years.",
      "When talking about his past, my dad described his parents\u2014his whole childhood, really\u2014in vague, whitewashed snippets, offering little detail. The stories, as they came down to me, reminded me of old-timey telegrams: I lived on Oahu, in Hawaii, until I graduated from Punahou High School in 1944. Stop. I joined the army and fought in World War II. Stop. I was sent to Okinawa and earned a Bronze Star. Stop. It was the same when describing his family: My father served as a naval officer before dying in a car crash. Stop. End of discussion.",
      "Occasionally, tiny details slipped out, but they were mostly about other people or the larger historical forces that sent him to war. \"I went to the South Pacific,\" my father told me once. \"Because if American soldiers with German names were captured by the Nazis, they suffered mightily for betraying the homeland. They told me if a U.S. soldier with German blood was captured by the Reich,\" he said, his face blank, \"they were badly tortured.\"",
      "But then it was back to his telegrams. I served again in Korea, then moved to New Jersey and married my first wife. Stop. We had two sons, but eventually divorced. Stop. I married your mom and we settled in Jacksonville. Stop. She had three children from an earlier marriage. Stop. You were born in 1963. Stop.",
      "It had all led him to a quiet, normal life.",
      "My father kept us away from his first family. He spoke very little about his wife and kids from the earlier marriage, and they had no contact. A picture of his two sons, framed in his office, was all we knew of them.",
      "Life tumbled forward. In our family we rarely spoke about my dad's past. But on a sultry and dull June evening in the summer of 1976, his past arrived at our door. I was eating dinner with my mom and dad when the doorbell rang.",
      "I jumped up to answer it, hoping, I'm sure, it was a friend from the neighborhood wanting to hang out. Instead, it was a man, tall and wiry, much like my dad.",
      "\"Can I help you?\" I asked, a little sheepishly.",
      "\"Is your dad home?\" he responded.",
      "I had no idea who this tall stranger with a bristly mustache was, so I ran back to the kitchen.",
      "\"Hey, Dad, there's a man at the front door, he's looking for you. Says you know him.\"",
      "Dad got up quickly and disappeared down the hallway. When he got to the door, he recognized the man immediately. It was almost like looking in a mirror.",
      "On the other side of the screen door was a man in his twenties, fair-skinned, tall like my father, his face obscured by the cross-hatching of the metal.",
      "\"Don't say anything about my family\u2014they don't know!\" were the first words out of my dad's mouth as he stepped outside and closed the door behind him. He was talking about his parents, brothers, and sister. Then he hugged the man he hadn't seen in more than ten years. It was his eldest son, my half-brother, who years later would tell me the details of their reunion.",
      "I didn't piece it together at the time, but in retrospect, that moment was the first glimpse that my dad had secrets.",
      "I later learned he hadn't always been so guarded and cryptic about his past. He had married relatively young, at age twenty-three. He told his new bride everything\u2014his tragic upbringing, the sins of the family. He was young and in love. There was nothing to hide.",
      "They had two sons and led a quiet, happy life in the suburbs, the tragedies of his past finally vanquished to a place in the recesses of his memory. But as the years rolled by, things began to slowly unravel. By the time the boys were out of diapers the screaming fights between my dad and his first wife were becoming commonplace.",
      "The arguments were ugly and heated, both sides hurling insults like bombs. Toward the end, when they'd burned through whatever love they had left for each other, his wife took to hitting him where it hurt most, invoking the past.",
      "\"Nazi!\" she would yell at him. \"Go back to Germany, where you belong!\"",
      "It had to be a crushing insult. A painful legacy he confided to a person he loved had been turned against him, dredging up the agonizing memories of his past. He wouldn't make that mistake again.",
      "Kensington, Maryland",
      "Eighteen years after that unexpected visit from my estranged half-brother, on a Friday afternoon in the summer of 1994, I snagged a handful of mail and sifted through it as I made my way toward the kitchen. Mostly junk and a couple of bills. One letter, though, looked different. It was addressed to Christine Kuehn, my maiden name, typed in a formal bold, black print. The return address was from California, and the sender wasn't familiar to me.",
      "I slid my finger into the corner of the envelope and opened it. When Mark came down twenty minutes later, I was staring into the distance. Mark dropped onto the couch next to me. He could see something was wrong.",
      "\"I got a weird letter,\" I said. \"Some guy writing a movie about World War II.\"",
      "The mysterious screenwriter was asking about my grandfather on my father's side. Dad had always told me his father was a naval officer who'd had an unexceptional career and died suddenly in a traffic accident. But the letter said something different: that Otto Kuehn had been involved with the Nazis.",
      "The word Nazi seemed to burn itself into the stationery. Mark stared at me, thoroughly puzzled. I handed him the note. The screenwriter was researching the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the role of German spies in the tragedy. He was trying to contact my father.",
      "\"Seems crazy,\" Mark said, after reading the letter. \"Your dad would have told you something if this were true, wouldn't he?\"",
      "I started to say something but stopped. Actually, I thought, my dad never really said much about his family. Or the past.",
      "\"There are lots of Kuehns in the phone book,\" Mark said. \"He must have the wrong ones. Or maybe he's just a crackpot.\"",
      "I pushed up from the couch to head to bed. Has to be the wrong Kuehns, I thought.",
      "I considered calling my father and asking him to dismiss the whole thing, but it seemed so far-fetched that I didn't want to bother him with some wild speculation about Hitler and the war and all that horror. He had always been vague and evasive about his father's naval career and his death. Besides, we were true-blue patriotic Americans; my father had served in two wars and hung an American flag outside the house every Fourth of July.",
      "I went to bed that night thinking I would write the screenwriter back and tell him he had the wrong family.",

    "summary": "In 1994 Christine Kuehn received a letter that revealed a family history from which her father had tried to shield her: Christine's grandfather, Otto, was a Nazi spy who was the only person tried and convicted for the bombing of Pearl Harbor.",
    "story": [
      "Christine Kuehn and her husband, Mark, kept what they were learning hidden in a basement closet until she finally decided to write a book about her \"Family of Spies.\" \"I stopped and started so many times because, you know, I was having trouble accepting what I was learning,\" she said. \"My grandfather was the only person tried and convicted for the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\"",
      "Kuehn's father tried to shield her from this not-to-be-believed family saga. \"He wouldn't talk about his past,\" Christine said. \"He always really skirted the issue.\"",
      "And her Aunt Ruth warned her to stay away from it: \"She said, 'You have a good life. Don't ruin it with the past.'\"",
      "But the past landed on her doorstep in 1994, when a letter came out of the blue. \"Kind of turns your life upside-down,\" she said, \"when you think your life was one way and then you find out that it wasn't the truth.\"",
      "A Hollywood screenwriter had come across the Kuehn name in histories of Pearl Harbor, and wanted to know if she was related to the family of Nazis who had spied for the Japanese. \"I called my dad, and I was like, 'Hey Dad, I got this letter,'\" Christine said. \"Talked to him about it. And he was like, 'Oh no, that can't be our family.\u00a0 They must be thinking about someone else.' Ten or fifteen minutes later, he called me back, and he was sobbing.\"",
      "A family transformed by the Nazi Party",
      "Christine spent the next 30 years documenting the story her father told her, beginning with her grandfather, Otto, and his family in Hitler's Germany. \"The whole family just was transformed by the promises that were being told by Hiter and the Nazi Party,\" Christine said.",
      "Her Uncle Leopold was a stormtrooper, proudly wearing a swastika in his wedding photo. Aunt Ruth, the woman who had told Christine to leave the past alone, was sleeping with Hitler's minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. \"She met him when she was only 19,\" Christine said.",
      "It didn't last, and in 1935 Goebbels shipped the family half-a-world away to Hawaii, and the U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor, to spy for the Japanese.",
      "Her grandfather lived large, throwing parties that made the society columns. \"He would invite Naval officers to come in and enjoy the party while he was trying to glean information about, you know, troop numbers and information like that,\" said Christine.",
      "He took pictures of American airplanes lined up wing tip-to-wing tip \u2013 just asking to be bombed \u2013 while Aunt Ruth played the femme fatale. \"She was young and beautiful. She would be wined and dined by the Navy officials, and she would talk with them and silently glean information about when the boats were in,\" Christine said.",
      "To get the information to the Japanese, Otto would walk into the Japanese consulate with a satchel and give them everything he had collected.",
      "In 1939, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover ordered an investigation \"to determine whether the Kuehns are in fact espionage agents.\"",
      "Christine says her grandfather likely knew about plans to attack Pearl Harbor: \"When they were asking him to create the signal system to communicate to Japanese subs off the coast of Hawaii, I think he probably had an idea,\" she said. That system was comprised of putting a lantern in the dormer window of his home between 9 and 10 o'clock, which would mean battle cruisers had left the harbor.",
      "War was coming, but for her father, Eberhard, then a gangly teenager, life in Hawaii was an endless summer. \"My father and his younger brother, Hans, were just normal kids enjoying life on a beautiful island,\" said Christine. \"It was kind of like paradise for them.\"",
      "That is, until December 7, 1941.",
      "\"I'm an American. I'm staying here\"",
      "On December 8, in the middle of the night, there was a banging on the Kuehns' \u00a0door. The FBI came in and arrested the whole family. Christine's father was held at a place called Sand Island, while Otto was hauled before a secret military tribunal.",
      "She found the tribunal's transcript in the National Archives. It read: \"\u2026 upon secret written ballot all of the members present at the time the vote was taken concurring, sentence the accused TO BE SHOT TO DEATH WITH MUSKETRY\" \u2013 the firing squad.",
      "That death sentence went all the way to President Franklin Roosevelt, before it was commuted to 50 years at hard labor. But after only four years, Otto Kuehn was released and ordered deported to Germany, an act of leniency J. Edgar Hoover found \"astounding.\"",
      "Christine's father was released from Sand Island \u2013 and turned his back on the family. \"He ended up writing a letter and saying, 'Germany is not my home; I'm an American. I'm staying here,'\" said Christine, \"and he refused to return to the family. I don't know that I could have done that at 15.\"",
      "When he turned 18, Eberhard joined the Army and fought on Okinawa, the last great battle of the war that had begun at Pearl Harbor. He never found out why his father spied for the Japanese.",
      "\"He actually asked his dad, 'Did you do this and why did you do it?'\" Christine said. \"And Otto never answered him. And so, my dad got up and he walked out and he never saw his father again.\"",
      "It was all so long ago. But the memory of Pearl Harbor is forever, and the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial over the battleship sunk on December 7th is an indelible part of the American landscape \u2013 which Christine could not bring herself to visit.",
      "\"I didn't think I deserved to be there,\" she said, crying, \"because my family had been involved.\"",
      "That was 10 years ago. Today, she says, \"I don't think I carry that same shame that I was carrying back then.\"",
      "Her father, who wanted to shield her from the shame, finally showed her the way to escape it. \"My father made the decision to walk away from his family,\" she said. \"He was a true American, and I'm a result of him and his decisions, not my grandfather's decisions.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 07 Dec 2025 07:00:15 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch and flex his presidential power are set to be tested at the Supreme Court on Monday, when the justices convene to hear a case that could lead to the dismantling of protections meant to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The case, known as Trump v. Slaughter, arose from Mr. Trump's move to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her post at the Federal Trade Commission without cause, despite a federal statute that limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Now, the high court is set to decide whether those removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers, and whether it should overturn a landmark 1935 decision in a case called Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "The legal battle is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of Humphrey's Executor by the court's conservative justices. In that 90-year-old ruling, which involved President Franklin Roosevelt's attempt to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission, the high court allowed Congress to shield certain independent agency members from being removed by the president at will.",
      "But in several recent decisions, the conservative justices have chipped away at the precedent. Most recently, it ended removal protections for officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, he has sought to expand the bounds of presidential power and moved to fire a swath of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions.",
      "Trump's firing of Slaughter",
      "Slaughter was among the victims of the president's campaign to \"reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.\" Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by Biden, she received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.\"",
      "The president's move to fire Slaughter and a fellow Democratic commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya, left the FTC with only three commissioners, who were all Republicans.",
      "Slaughter, like many other independent agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, sued to get her job back and argued that her removal was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. But Mr. Trump had not followed the law, she argued.",
      "A federal district court ruled in her favor, finding that Slaughter's removal was unlawful. It ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But that decision was the first in a series of re-hirings and re-firings. Days after Slaughter prevailed before the district court, the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks after that, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated once again.",
      "Then, when the Trump administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts cleared the way for her firing. The high court agreed in late September to hear the case and continued to keep her out of her post while it considers whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers.",
      "What's at stake",
      "That issue, and the fate of its 1935 precedent, will be before the high court Monday, when the justices convene for arguments.",
      "\"It's very likely the Supreme Court is going to say that in order for the president to be able to do his job, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, he has to have control of the people helping him execute those laws,\" said Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision could have significant ramifications for the structure of the federal government and curtail Congress' power to impose limits on the president's removal power.",
      "\"The president is supposed to have certain powers that are separated from the legislative branch, and if the legislative branch goes in there and says we're going to interfere with your powers by saying you're not allowed to remove these people, that's a violation of the separation of powers,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him \"illimitable\" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president \"saddled with subordinate officers\" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed.",
      "While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers \"to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies that regulate many aspects of American life, from nuclear waste to telemarketing to consumer products, with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.",
      "In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power for multi-member agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers. The high court found that the FTC fit within those parameters, and its commissioners could therefore only be removed for cause.",
      "But the Trump administration argued that the trade commission of today is different from the agency of 90 years ago because it has amassed executive powers. The modern FTC executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote.",
      "Additionally, the FTC can now file civil suits seeking monetary penalties, make substantive rules, issue final orders in agency adjudications and investigate potential violations, he said.",
      "\"The notion that some agencies that exercise executive power can be sequestered from presidential control seriously offends the Constitution's structure and the liberties that the separation of powers protects,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Impacts of the court's decision",
      "If the Supreme Court invalidates the removal protections for FTC commissioners, such a decision is likely to reach far beyond the commission.",
      "Because many statutes restrict a president to removing an official for inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office, Fitzpatrick predicted the high court will \"say those words are an unconstitutional restriction on the president so all the other agencies with those words will be in the same boat.\"",
      "Lawyers for Slaughter, meanwhile, warned of the broad impacts of a decision overturning the Supreme Court's 1935 decision, writing in a filing that doing so would destabilize institutions that have been woven into the fabric of U.S. governance.",
      "\"Multimember independent agencies are deeply ingrained in our Nation's history and tradition, from the First Congress to the present day,\" they said. \"That history confirms that they are fully compatible with our Constitution's text and structure.\"",
      "Slaughter's legal team argued that the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to transfer new powers to the president that Congress chose not to give him and wants courts to \"jettison longstanding laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.\"",
      "They also said the current structure of multimember independent agencies \u2014 composed of members from both parties who serve for staggered terms and are insulated from political shifts \u2014 leads to \"more modest actions\" and therefore protects individual liberty better than an agency helmed by a single person.",
      "\"What the statutory protection for a member's tenure guarantees is that a political minority, the minority party, will always be represented in deliberations, which is at the very least an important watchdog function,\" said Peter Shane, a legal scholar at New York University School of Law.",
      "He continued: \"But the other thing is it prevents presidents from sabotaging agencies and sabotaging the congressional design, either by eliminating from the agency members of the minority party, or enough members so that an agency lacks a quorum to function at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has already attempted to make his mark on the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects the rights of government workers. The president fired one of its members, Cathy Harris, in February, leaving the MSPB without a quorum between April and October.",
      "\"A president opposed to the statutory mission of an agency can entirely kneecap it by depriving it of a quorum, and the president can certainly deprive it of genuine bipartisanship by refusing to fill the seats that would belong to the minority party,\" Shane said. \"The minority signaling function is quite important and it has multiple audiences, including the majority on a particular commission. But it also includes journalists, the general public and the courts.\"",
      "Slaughter's lawyers argued that even with protections in place for leaders of independent agencies, presidents can still exert influence over them through the candidates they nominate and the chair they select, as well as through recommending or vetoing spending bills that affect agency operations.",
      "A key issue for the court will be how it characterizes the powers that an agency wields. When the Supreme Court earlier this year allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the MSPB, it suggested in an unsigned order that the agencies \"exercise considerable executive power.\" A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled Friday that removal protections for the two labor boards are unconstitutional and said Congress cannot restrict the president's ability to remove their members.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0attempted to fire\u00a0a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Lisa Cook. But the Supreme Court has so far allowed her to remain in her role, and the justices will\u00a0hear arguments on the case next month.",
      "\"All the agencies these days have a lot of powers, adjudicatory powers, rule-making powers, enforcement powers,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I suspect no matter how they do it, all the independent agencies with the exception of the Fed are going to be under the president's thumb.\"",
      "But more than 200 members of Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. Invalidating for-cause removal protections would have drastic consequences for the structure and operation of the federal government, they wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"[A]t-will removals of commissioners of independent agencies would lead regulated entities and the public to believe that the President is able to pick winners and losers in the American economy through intervening in individual cases,\" they said. \"That would detrimentally alter the way the public interacts with these regulators, and, consequently, the economic choices the regulators make.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump presented medals to the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees during an Oval Office ceremony.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday presented the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office, hailing the slate of artists he was deeply involved in choosing as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "\"This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,\" said a tuxedo-clad Mr. Trump. \"This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has instituted a series of changes\u00a0since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chair of the board. That triggered a number of artists to\u00a0cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",
      "The changes were instituted after the White House\u00a0accused the institution\u00a0of being \"woke\" and scrutinized its finances earlier this year.",
      "The president placed around each honoree's neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Mr. Trump.",
      "It's a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center's image and rainbow colors. The honoree's name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree's shoulders and chest.",
      "Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Mr. Trump said, \"If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.\" But Strait took it off.",
      "The president said Crawford was a \"great star of Broadway\" for his lead role in the long-running \"Phantom of the Opera.\" Of Gaynor, he said, \"We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a \"wonderful\" and \"spectacular\" person and \"one of the true, great movie stars\" and \"one of the great legends.\"",
      "Kiss is an \"incredible rock band,\" he said.",
      "Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Mr. Trump to begin the ceremony.",
      "The president said in August that he was \"about 98% involved\" in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release.",
      "It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Mr. Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.",
      "\"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we've seen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom \u2014 and that was a phantom, let me tell you \u2014 or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that's what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\"",
      "\"Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.",
      "Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Center Honors program and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts center for broadcast Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS television stations and Paramount+. Mr. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump.",
      "The president said in August that he had agreed to host the show, and he seemed to confirm on Saturday that he would do so, predicting that the broadcast would garner its highest ratings ever as a result. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honorees in the audience. None has ever served as host.",
      "He said he looked forward to Sunday's celebration.",
      "\"It's going to be something that I believe, and I'm going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's going to happen tomorrow night,\" Mr. Trump said.",

    "summary": "The 63-year-old Roger Clemens has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, which he has denied.",
    "story": [
      "Ahead of Sunday's announcement of the 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame's Contemporary Era Class, President Trump on Saturday called on the committee to admit pitcher Roger Clemens, who is one of eight players on the ballot.",
      "In a lengthy Truth Social post, the president argued that the committee \"should do the right thing by finally putting Roger Clemens, known as 'The Rocket,' in the Hall!,\" adding that Clemens is \"clearly one of the Greatest Pitchers of All Time.\"",
      "The president noted Clemens' 354 career wins, ninth all-time in Major League Baseball history, and his seven Cy Young awards, an annual achievement given out to the best pitchers in the American and National leagues. He also had 4,672 strikeouts, third all-time behind Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Randy Johnson (4,875).",
      "The 63-year-old Clemens has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, which he has denied. In June of 2012, following a 10-week trial,\u00a0a federal jury found Clemens not guilty\u00a0of charges that he obstructed and lied to Congress in denying he had used PEDs.",
      "\"The only reason he is not is because of rumors and innuendo, which were not proven,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"He never tested positive and, when the Obama DOJ went after him in a criminal case claiming that he did take steroids, Roger, who has always denied taking any drugs, was FULLY ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES.\"",
      "Clemens was charged over a deposition and congressional testimony he gave in February 2008 in a nationally televised hearing. The charges centered on his repeated denials that he used steroids and human growth hormone during a 24-year career.",
      "In that 2008 hearing, Clemens told Congress that \"no matter what we discuss here today, I'm never going to have my name restored.\"",
      "He was denied election to the Hall for 10 straight years by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, with his final ballot appearance coming in 2022, his last year of eligibility under the traditional rules.",
      "However, they are now in the Contemporary Baseball Era player ballot, which according to the Hall \"features candidates whose primary contribution to the game came since 1980.\"",
      "The Hall in 2022 restructured its veterans committees for the third time in 12 years, setting up panels to consider the contemporary era from 1980 on as well as the classic era. The contemporary baseball era holds separate ballots for players and another for managers, executives and umpires.",
      "Each committee meets every three years. Contemporary managers, executives and umpires will be considered in December 2026, classic era candidates in December 2027 and contemporary era players again in December 2028.",
      "The contemporary committee features 16 members, including Hall of Fame players Ferguson Jenkins, Jim Kaat, Juan Marichal, Tony P\u00e9rez, Ozzie Smith, Alan Trammell and Robin Yount. They will be joined by former major league general managers Kim Ng, Doug Melvin, Tony Reagins and Terry Ryan, and media members Tyler Kepner and Jayson Stark of The Athletic and historian Steve Hirdt, the Hall said Tuesday.",
      "Owners Mark Attanasio of the Milwaukee Brewers and Arte Moreno of the Los Angeles Angels also are on the committee that gathers Sunday at the winter meetings in Orlando, Florida.",
      "Each voter can select up to three candidates, and 75% or more of ballots are needed for election. Anyone chosen will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 26 along with players voted in by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, whose balloting will be announced on Jan. 20.",
      "Under a change announced by the Hall last March, any candidate on the ballot who receives fewer than five votes will not be eligible for that committee's ballot during the next three-year cycle. A candidate who is dropped, later reappears on a ballot and again receives fewer than five votes would be barred from future ballot appearances.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 17:01:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"It's very discouraging,\" said one young job-seeker as employers pull back on hiring entry-level workers.",
    "story": [
      "Angel Escobedo started looking for work a year and a half ago, even before completing his college degree at Saint Xavier University in Chicago. Now, with less than a week to go before graduation and having applied to more than 150 jobs, he's still searching.",
      "Escobedo's predicament illustrates the challenges that many young Americans, even those with impressive academic records, are having entering the nation's workforce amid a broad decline in job listings and as they compete with more experienced people.",
      "\"They're sort of missing out on the ability to jump into the labor market,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. \"It's not a new phenomenon, but it is a concerning phenomenon.\"",
      "For young adults eager to start their careers, the obstacles can seem daunting. Escobedo, 22, has had multiple professional internships during his college career and also completed a management training program at Harvard Business School. The Illinois resident, who is seeking a job in finance or business operations, said he has found the job search process \"very discouraging,\" noting that he's open to just about any kind of employment.",
      "Gen Z job applicants, like other workers, are also having to navigate a quickly changing job-hunting landscape in which employers increasingly use AI and self-recorded video interviews to screen candidates. Job seekers told CBS News that while it's easy to apply for work, finding ways to stand out is hard, while the new tech adds a new layer of complexity.",
      "Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and University of California, Berkeley, faculty member, said the stakes for Gen Z are high. If they can't get the right experience early on, they could struggle to catch up professionally and financially.",
      "\"If the pool of entry-level opportunities continues to dry up, then it's going to be ever more challenging for this generation to show certain brand names, certain job titles and certain bullet points on their resumes, which is only going to make that next job more challenging to get,\" he said.",
      "Slowdown in hiring",
      "Getting your foot in the door has always been tougher for young workers, and current labor market conditions aren't making it any easier. The overall hiring rate, which has been declining since 2022, has fallen to just over 3%, below its historical average, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Hiring is muted due to uncertainty about the U.S. economy, including the government policy environment and tariffs, Gould told CBS News. \"There's this sort of sitting tight for employers and for workers right now, not wanting to make any sudden moves because of the uncertainty,\" she said.",
      "The nation's overall unemployment rate in September was 4.4% \u2014 less than half the 9.2% rate for 20- to 24-year-olds, according to government labor figures.",
      "Even when early-career employees succeed in landing a coveted position, they may face barriers climbing the ladder. That's because, with more seasoned employees often staying put these days because of economic uncertainty and as employment turnover slows, Gen Zers have fewer opportunities to switch jobs \u2014 a common route to gaining more responsibilities and higher pay.",
      "\"Your salary is all about growing or negotiating leverage,\" Ng said. \"And so when you look for another position, one of the easiest ways to ask for more money is to have made more money in the past.\"",
      "Alan Gonzalez, a 23-year-old resident of Malden, Mass., said he'd be willing to take a lower-paying job in his field just to kick-start his career. Since graduating from UMass Boston in May, he has been working as a restaurant server while looking for a position in digital marketing.",
      "\"Despite having a lot of internship experience and real-world practical experience that I can apply, including my degree, it has still been very difficult to even get an interview opportunity,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Eager to exercise his creativity but without any job offers in hand, Gonzalez has also started his own clothing brand, HOJA Apparel, which he describes as a \"lifestyle streetwear meets streetwear hybrid\" focused on high-quality and design. He's working to grow his social media presence to promote the brand, with an official clothing drop planned for next year.",
      "\"Right now, the priority is experience,\" Gonzalez said.",
      "Some industries pose their own challenges when Gen Z job-hunters come knocking. For example, employers in fields such as accounting, engineering and technology typically have fewer job openings for junior employees than senior-level roles, according to data from career services firm Indeed.",
      "\"It has become progressively harder for almost anyone to secure jobs in those areas, and this is especially true for younger workers,\" Cory Stahle, senior economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email. \"Fewer opportunities also mean that entry-level workers are becoming more likely to compete against an increasing number of mid- or senior-level workers in the process as well.\"",
      "As of October, an average of around 30% of software development jobs listed on Indeed were for positions with senior titles, versus around 2% for roles with junior titles. Similar discrepancies exist for data analysis and tech positions.",
      "Many of the challenges of finding work are not unique to members of Gen Z, of course. Technology has long made it easier for people to submit a job application. But the latest technologies are also upping the competitive ante, according to Ng.",
      "\"AI and tech tools have made it easier to apply for internships,\" he said. \"But whenever something gets easier, the bar only gets higher, and the job application is really no different.\"",
      "Ng advises job candidates to get back to basics. That means trying to build relationships with potential employers, starting their job search early and making a concerted effort to get in front of a company's decision-makers.",
      "Escobedo said he's now putting an emphasis on old-school networking to get employers' attention. \"I've told my peers, the whole thing that it takes a village to raise a child, now it takes a village to get a college student a full-time role.\"",

      "The group, which called itself the Military Committee for Refoundation, announced the removal of President Talon and all state institutions. Lt. Col. Pascal Tigri was appointed president of the military committee, the soldiers said.",
      "Soon after, eyewitnesses told\u00a0CBS News partner the BBC\u00a0that they had heard gunshots and some journalists with the state broadcaster were held hostage.",

      "Later, Interior Minister Alassane Seidou announced in a video on Facebook that the attempted coup had been \"foiled.",
      "\"In the early morning of Sunday, Dec. 7, 2025, a small group of soldiers launched a mutiny with the aim of destabilizing the state and its institutions,\" Alassane Seidou said. \"Faced with this situation, the Beninese Armed Forces and their leadership, true to their oath, remained committed to the republic.\"",
      "Hours later, Talon addressed the attempted coup.",

      "The president did not provide figures on casualties or hostages.",
      "\"I would like to assure you that the situation is completely under control and therefore invite you to calmly go about your activities starting this very evening,\" Talon added.",
      "The signal to the state television and public radio, which was cut off, has now been restored. Local media reported the arrest of 13 soldiers who took part in the coup earlier on Sunday, citing sources close to the presidency. It remains unclear if Tigri has been apprehended.",
      "Following its independence from France in 1960, the West African nation experienced multiple coups, particularly in the decades that followed. Since 1991, the country has been politically stable following the two-decade rule of Marxist-Leninist Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look at some recent changes to U.S. public health policy. We're joined now by former FDA commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb. He also serves on the boards of Pfizer and United Healthcare. Welcome back.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know there was some pretty big news on Friday, and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they are deeply alarmed that the CDC vaccine advisory panel, ACIP voted in this 8-3 decision to change this 30 year long policy regarding Hepatitis B and newborns. They are now recommending delaying the dose until a child is two months old, instead of within 24 hours of birth. What does this decision mean for families of newborns?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. Well, look, I think we first need to understand why we give that birth dose of the vaccine, because the idea of giving a vaccine to a newborn, to a lot of parents, sounds discomforting, that the first thing a child is going to face when they're born is going to be a vaccine within the first 24 hours. For a child over the age of five, if they develop Hepatitis B infection, if they're exposed to it, they're going to have a 95% chance of clearing that infection, and they'll go on to develop lifelong immunity. For children between the ages of one and five, they only have about a 25 to 50% chance of clearing the infection, so about 25 to 50% of kids will develop chronic infection, and about a quarter of them will go on to die from hepatitis B if they're between the ages of one and five. So children are more vulnerable to this virus and can't clear the infection. But when you're talking about a newborn, an infant, 90% of newborns who become infected, and they'll become infected during delivery, will go on to develop chronic infection, they won't be able to clear the hepatitis B, and about 25% of them will die from sequelae of that infection, either from liver disease, cirrhosis or from liver cancer. So we have this unique opportunity by giving this birth dose and the subsequent inoculations to virtually eliminate the chance that a newborn can contract Hepatitis B and go on to develop chronic infection, it's almost 99% effective at preventing that chronic infection. And the refrain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And\u2013",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And one final point, the refrain is, oh, sorry, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no. And this decision now is to wait two months before giving that dose.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President of the United States came out and said, this was very good, because Hep B is only transmitted sexually or through dirty needles.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, that's the problem. That's simply not true. The fact is, there's a refrain that if you just test the moms during, while they're pregnant, you can detect whether they have hepatitis B, and if they have hepatitis B, you continue to give that birth dose. But the reality is, many moms don't get tested, even though they intend to, many times, those test results aren't checked, and the tests themselves have a false negative rate, meaning they're going to say you don't have hepatitis B, when in fact, you do, of about 2 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but that 2% is going to translate into at least 1000 babies being born and getting infected with hepatitis B. There was one modeling estimate that estimated in the first year of this new guidance, there's going to be 1,400 children, infants contracting hepatitis B, and again, 25% of them will die from that infection.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look at this because there is this broader scrutiny of vaccines right now by the Trump administration and in this board decision, which the public could listen into. It was publicly broadcast. The board was hand picked by RFK Jr, who is a skeptic here of vaccines, from those who voted against the decision to delay. One of them who you heard at the top of the show said the CDC is doing harm. Another said, \"No rational science has been presented, and the committee must accept responsibility when harm is caused.\" Those are pretty extraordinary statements. If the group making a decision that has such high consequences for the most vulnerable Americans isn't basing it on science, no rational science, what does that indicate about what comes next?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this is the ACIP by and large, except for a handful of members, are anti-vax activists who were put there to carry out a specific agenda. And look, the Secretary, to his credit, has been very honest about what his intentions are here. He's the most prominent anti-vaxer in the country prior to coming into this position, and he stated that his goal is to eliminate childhood immunization, or many of these childhood immunizations, and I think they're going to take a methodical approach and slowly chip away at this. This is a big unforced error insofar as ACIP was a esteemed body that a lot of states tie their own decision making to, and what we're seeing right now is as a group, it's being degraded, and I don't think it will ever be restored. I don't think you can just flip the switch and restore this where people are going to suddenly respect its decisions again. There's about 600 state laws that were tied to decisions ACIP made. About 17 states have already passed new legislation saying they will no longer respect the decisions of ACIP. The insurers came out and said they're going to tie their own coverage decisions to the professional bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and not ACIP. So I think in time, ACIP is going to be fully degraded as a decision making body, and it's going to be more symbolic. There will be certain states that- that adhere to it, but will be more symbolic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you this week, we saw a big sell off in biotech stocks following these reports that the FDA, which you used to run the first part of the Trump administration, is now going to require one study to clinch approval of vaccines. You were one of the former commissioners who put out this really extraordinary editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, arguing that the FDA and top vaccine regulator, Dr. Vinay Prasad, are changing policies in a way that's going to slow down new and better vaccines. What specifically is the problem you see? Because this isn't just hep B, this is the vaccines of the future. You're saying just won't be created?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. So Vinay Prasad, who is the head of the biologic center. Also oversees the vaccine Division. He also has been appointed the head of biostatistics, the Chief Medical Officer of the agency, and chief scientific officer. So he occupies a lot of positions. Put out a memo saying that they're going to do away with, or move away from, what they call immuno bridging studies. These are studies that allow you for well validated vaccines, like the flu vaccine, to be able to demonstrate each year that the vaccine, the new vaccine, that's formulated against the circulating strain, can elicit antibodies that are effective against that particular strain, and that could be the basis of approval, rather than requiring new outcome studies every year to prove that the vaccine actually reduces the incidence of influenza. For established vaccines, where we know that antibody production is a good correlate for immunity, this has been a long standing practice. It's, we do it for flu vaccine, we do it in covid Certainly, we do it for things like pneumococcal vaccine, the vaccine for pneumococcal disease, where we look at serotypes circulating bacterial serotypes. This allows us to update vaccines as these viral and bacterial strains change, and as the composition of the strains change in time to provide protection for the Fall respiratory season. If they move away from this, which is what he said, they plan to do, we're just not going to be able to update vaccines each season, as we've done historically, to accommodate whatever the circulating strain is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 12 former FDA commissioners came out saying they're deeply concerned about what is happening. That memo that made clear the changes that are happening within the FDA from Dr. Prasad was obtained by CBS, and it claimed that career FDA staff are making changes in part because they found at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving the Covid vaccine, referred to it as a profound revelation, and said and asked, Did it kill more healthy kids than it saved? The administration, to date, has not backed up information to back up these claims, but, but, what questions do you have for the FDA commissioner, because they're arguing they're doing this to help people?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, well, first of all, one thing doesn't flow from the next. So the idea if, in fact, they found cases where the covid vaccine was linked to tragic deaths, it doesn't then follow that you make these policy changes. In fact, the policy changes wouldn't address what the concerns are related to the covid vaccine itself. These are- every case needs to be carefully adjudicated. It's tragic to see any suspected case that could be linked to a vaccine. And these were looked at previously by the FDA, and I don't believe that the new FDA had access to the case level data analysis of cases, individual cases that get filed with the agency where there is a death in proximity to vaccination, and some of these are filed by the manufacturers themselves are very subjective and require the goodwill the people involved in that. And so I think that they should make that analysis public so it could be scrutinized and people can get comfort in that they've already backed away from the 10 is reporting from endpoints that now they're saying it's eight or nine, so they're already backing away from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. And HHS said they will eventually make that data public. We'll look for it when it comes out. Dr Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Connecticut. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of the few lawmakers shown the classified version of this September 2 video of the U.S. strikes an alleged drug boat near Venezuela, four strikes in total, we have learned. You met with Admiral Bradley, who commands special operations as well. The President of the United States says he is open to this video being made public. Do you think it is essential that it become public, and are you confident it will be?",
      "REP. HIMES: I think it's really important that this video be made public. It's not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which you know, six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines. And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself. I know how the public is going to be react- is going to react because I felt my own reaction. You know, I've spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context, and this video was profoundly shaking- shaken, and I think it's important for Americans to see it. Because, look, there's a certain amount of there's a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners, but I think it's really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was it- why did it shake you so much? What specifically was bothering you?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, you know, and this is sort of the distinction, and there's a lot to unpack here about whether this is an authorized military action, which it is not, and right on down to whether these were legitimate- legitimate targets, and they were not. But let me go back to some of the reviews I've done of other lethal action. Oftentimes, when the Department of Defense takes a strike against a terrorist in Yemen or Pakistan or wherever, you watch a video of guys fully armed with AK-47s and sidearms and bombs and you name it, and they're on their way to do something terrible. And in this instance, you may have had bad guys, I have no doubt that these guys were involved in the running of drugs. Now, whether they were running it to the United States or Europe is yet another question. But in that instance, these guys were about to die. Had the United States just walked away, their little piece of wood would have gone under the waves. And as many times as Tom Cotton may say that it doesn't matter what they were doing, it matters essentially what they were doing. Because under the law, and if you spent 15 minutes in law school, you know this, under the law, if someone has been struck and is- continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target. But if they are outside of combat, they are not and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war. And these guys, and this is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were, were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the DOD law of war manual seems to hinge a lot of that on whether the person is wholly disabled from fighting, and that is where the Secretary of Defense has used language saying they're about to return to the fight. I'm going to play for you what Secretary Hegseth said at the Reagan Forum Saturday. He described what was happening with these four strikes on the alleged drug running boat.",
      "SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PETE HEGSETH ON TAPE: A couple hours later, I was told, hey, there had to be a reattack, because there were a couple folks that could still be in the fight. Access to radios, there was a link up point of another potential boat, drugs were still there, they were actively interacting with them. Had to take that reattack. I said, Roger, sounds good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does what Hegseth said match what Admiral Bradley told you?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, there was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth's role here was, but Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter, right? Remember, a week after this strike, there was a briefing for Congress. Why was a follow up strike taken? The answer then, in the first week of September, was a follow up strike was taken because we needed to clear the wreckage so that there wasn't a danger to navigation. That was explanation number one. Explanation number two, right before we watched the video, was that they might have had a radio, and they might have been radioing a boat, and they might have been trying to recover the cocaine. And then when you actually watch the video, you realize they don't have a radio. They're barely hanging on and not slipping beneath the waves. Then we get this thing of how they're trying to right the boat. This was about a 40 foot boat that had just been hit with a massive piece of munitions. The conflagration probably destroyed everything in that boat. But, oh, maybe they might have swum under, gotten a radio, probably waterlogged, and radioed a boat that we're not even sure was there. So what we've had is a series of shifting explanations. Oh, and including the fog of war, right? You know that Hegseth said, well, they took the second strike because of the fog of war. There was no fog. The military watched this boat very carefully, or I shouldn't even say, boat, they watched the wreckage of the boat very carefully for a long period of time before they took the second strike. So, look, what Pete Hegseth says about this strike has zero credibility at this point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have confidence in Admiral Bradley?",
      "REP. HIMES: You know Admiral Bradley, this was my first meeting with him. Anyone who has ever worked with Admiral Bradley will tell you that he has a storied career and that he is a man of deep, deep integrity. And frankly, I have no reason to doubt that. What it raises is, what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired. When he works for a guy, Pete Hegseth, who wrote a book about how we shouldn't observe the laws of war, about how we need to be lethal in [unintelligible]. It's interesting to think about how a good man in that context maybe does something that, if he weren't in that context, he might not do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said there were dozens of JAG law- lawyers observing all of this. On NBC this morning he said all 11 people on the suspected drug smuggling boat were valid targets because the U.S. had high confidence they were part of a foreign terrorist organization. Do you know, were these high level cartel members?",
      "REP. HIMES: No, of course not. Of course not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who were they, if the U.S. had high confidence--",
      "REP. HIMES: You think Pablo Escobar back- well, first of all, first of all, let's be super clear about this. I don't think we knew the identities of any of the people in the boat. We might have known one or two, I don't know, but we certainly didn't know the identities of all 11. So nobody can characterize who all these people in any of these boats are. Now, I have enough confidence in the intelligence community to know that these are probably not guys out fishing or guys out, you know, being tourists and stuff. They are almost certainly running drugs. But this really matters for the reason that you said. You know, if you're going to occupy an immense amount of the American naval combat capability, you'd like to believe that you're going after the leaders, the cartel leaders, the- the kingpins, as they say. What we're doing here is we're taking out the equivalent of the corner drug dealer in the Bronx, right? Which, by the way, we should arrest the corner drug dealer in the Bronx. But the main reason we do that is to go after the kingpins who, I promise you, are sitting in very comfortable villas right now in Colombia and Venezuela and everywhere, and watching as much of the United States Navy is dedicated to taking out their lowest level employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I hear you saying they were not on an internal military target list for high value individuals. That's what I hear, what you're saying.",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, this is an interesting question. I'm not at all convinced that there is a list of individuals. Now, this is what we do in the terrorism world, right? We designate high value targets. We designate individuals. I have no reason to believe, and in fact, I doubt that there are any individuals on the list anywhere. What we are doing, and I'm not going to get terribly specific about it, for obvious reasons, but what we are doing is we're picking up that this boat may be carrying drugs, and to the administration, it doesn't matter who's in that boat, because- and look, they're saying this, because if this boat is actually carrying drugs, then we can strike it. So no, I don't think there is a list of individuals. I don't think we have any idea who precisely the individuals in these boats are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So as I understand it, these are signature strikes. This is an intelligence assessment based on signals intelligence saying this is who we believe these individuals to be. You know, some of these defenders of the Trump policy, like conservative columnists, have argued this is a precedent that was set by the Obama administration, which used signature strikes to kill alleged al Qaeda operatives, including a U.S. citizen at one point in Yemen. Do they have a point here that the drone policy has long allowed the killing of suspected criminals, even without due process?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, there's a couple of really important distinctions, and you'll remember that the Obama administration, there was a lot of debate over whether signature strikes were okay or not. The most important distinction is that Congress authorized the war on terror. There was an authorization for the use of military force. The original sin of this whole thing, whether you think we should be wasting these guys or not, the original sin is that there is no congressional authorization. And then in the Obama administration, they did have a list of individuals, right? Often high value targets, or HVTs as we've referred to them. And then the question was, if you have an HVT, a high value target, in a jeep in northern Pakistan, and there's a guy next to that HVT, you know, how do you feel about taking that strike? You want to take down the high value guy, but what about the young guy next to him? Well, the young guy has an AK 47 and the young guy was actually arranging for the transfer of explosives. You have that conversation, and then you decide whether you're gonna take the strike. Right now what we're doing, and again, don't- I don't think that there's a list of individuals anywhere. They're just saying that boat is carrying drugs. And even though military is not authorized by the Congress of the United States, we're taking out the boat, and we don't give a damn about who's on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and when you say \"I don't think,\" you are a member of the Gang of Eight, so presumably that information should be shared with you if it does exist. I want to ask you before I let you go. Signalgate, people may remember a few months ago, the Trump- a Trump official added a journalist to an online group on Signal and shared advanced information of an upcoming bombing operation in Yemen. The Pentagon Inspector General said Hegseth's actions risked operational security and violated federal laws on record keeping. Hegseth said he'd do the same thing all over again. Are your Republican colleagues saying in private that they have problems with what happened?",
      "REP. HIMES: Absolutely, they're saying it in private. In public, of course, they're saying that it was perfect exoneration, right? That this report, and you read the key line, that this report that said that the Secretary of Defense put his troops in the mission at risk, that that's total exoneration. Now, I didn't hear the comment about I would do this again. But if Pete Hegseth said he would do that again- and look, again, you don't need to be a military expert to understand that sharing operational details before an operation is a really, really, really bad idea. If Pete Hegseth said that, that he would do that again, you know, he's just reinforcing what we all know, which is that he has absolutely no business in that job. One of the most sensitive and difficult jobs to do in the United States government is being done by somebody who put his own people and the mission at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 He said he lives life without regret at the Reagan Forum, that was the phrase, to be more exact. But Congressman Himes, always good to have you on the program. I'll have to leave it there for today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Welcome to the program.",
      "REP. ILHAN OMAR: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "REP. OMAR: We have a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on where the Treasury Secretary just left off. He alleged that people who were tied to you or your campaign were involved in this broad, brazen scheme to rip off the Minnesota state welfare system. Do you want to respond to that? Do you know what he is referring to?",
      "REP. OMAR: I really don't, and I don't think the Secretary himself understands what he's referring to. We obviously had people who were able to donate to our campaign that were involved. We sent that money back a couple years ago. And actually, I was one of the first members of Congress to send a letter to the Secretary of Ag asking them to look into what I thought was a reprehensible fraud that was occurring within the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was just for our audience. The Biden-era Justice Department called it the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and this was pocketing COVID-era welfare funds, more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money that was stolen. It was pretty, pretty shocking. Of the 87 people charged, all but eight are of Somali descent, and that has added to the spotlight being put specifically on your community. Why do you think this fraud was allowed to get so widespread?",
      "REP. OMAR: I want to say, you know, this also has an impact on Somalis, because we are also taxpayers in Minnesota. We also could have benefited from the program and the money that was stolen. And so it's been really frustrating for people to not acknowledge the fact that we're, you know, we're also as Minnesotans as taxpayers, really upset and angry about the fraud that has occurred.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you think, though, that there was a failure by the Democratic state government to police itself? This is a brazen fraudulent activity here.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah, and that is what I alluded to in my letter that I had sent to the Secretary of Ag was to see where things were going wrong. How can this amount of money disappear fraudulently without there being alarms being set off? And it is something that you know, we have to continue to investigate. We have to continue to ask those questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, one of the initial defenses by the organization at the heart of the fraud, Feeding Our Future, was to claim the probe was due to racism. Do you think that this was all about negligence, or that it was like political fear of alienating the Somali community?",
      "REP. OMAR: So you have to remember that the woman who led the program is a Caucasian woman, and that was her way of making sure that this would continue to happen by using whatever rhetoric that was available to her. We do know that when the money was stopped, they did sue the AG. Attorney General Keith Ellison defended the department in that lawsuit. It was a judge that said it should contin- that money should continue to go out. And so this wasn't something that people were not looking at. There was always those, those alarms, and we will continue to understand where things might have gone wrong as these investigations continue, and as these fraudsters are prosecuted and sent to jail.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's going to have impact for your community, because we've already heard that the head of Medicare and Medicaid say they're going to have a new policy that applies to Minnesota. You heard the Treasury Secretary say they're investigating. But there's another thread here, because House Republicans and the Treasury Secretary just now talked about a link to terrorism, a possible link. He said they're just now beginning to look into it. How confident are you that that's a false claim?",
      "REP. OMAR: I'm pretty confident at the moment, because there are people who have been prosecuted and who have been sentenced. If there was a linkage in that, the money that they had stolen going to terrorism, then that is a failure of the FBI and our court system in not figuring that out and basically charging them with- with these, with these charges. And so I do know that for many years, this sort of like alarm that there is money being transferred through the airport in bags and going to terrorism has all- that accusation has always existed. There has never been here and there in those accusations. But if that is the case, if money from U.S. tax dollars is being sent to help with terrorism in Somalia, we want to know and we want those people prosecuted, and we want to make sure that that doesn't ever happen again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there are 80,000 people of Somali descent in your state, but the President has been very focused not just on them, but on you. In this extraordinary cabinet meeting, he said, Somalis, quote, \"come from hell.\" \"They complain and they do nothing but bitch.\" Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are people that do nothing but complain. They complain, and from where they came from, they've got nothing.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: \u2026We don't want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.\"",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That knocking is vehement agreement from his Cabinet members there. I just wonder what the reaction is in your district to have that from the highest office in the land.",
      "REP. OMAR: It's disgusting. It's completely disgusting. These are Americans that he is calling garbage. And we feel like there is an unhealthy obsession that he has on the Somali community, and an unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me. I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric and this level of dehumanizing can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 95% of the Somalis in your state are U.S. citizens.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yes.",
      "MARAGARET BRENNAN: Just for clarity there. But the president has restricted all immigration processing, including asylum claims from Somalis already on U.S. soil, along with 18 other countries. ICE reports it has rounded up about 19 people, and they put out press releases with the images of about five of them that they say are the worst of the worst is that the entirety of the crackdown to date?",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah, so far we know of the people that they have picked up in Minnesota, about five of them are Somalis, and from what I have read and from the people that I've spoken to, all of them had already had orders of removal. So these are not people who are undocumented, but people who have committed crimes and who should have already been sent out of the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you something else that the architect of the President's immigration policy, Stephen Miller, said. On Thanksgiving day he posted, \"No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions. and terrors, of their broken homelands.\"",
      "What do you make of this argument of failure to assimilate and sort of ruining America. How do you understand this?",
      "REP. OMAR: I mean, when I think about Stephen Miller and his white supremist rhetoric, it reminds me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's how you hear it--",
      "REP. OMAR: Yes, it reminds me of the way the Nazis described Jewish people in Germany. And you know, as we know, there have been many immigrants who have tried to come to the United States who have turned back, you know, one of them being Jewish immigrants. We know the way that people were described who were coming from Ireland, Irish immigrants. We know the way in which people were described back then, when there were Italian immigrants. And to me, you know, we're, we're, yes, of course, ethnically Somali, we are in this country as Americans, we are citizens, we are a productive part of this nation, and we will continue to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for your time today. And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' We have a lot of news to get to, and we begin with the Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent. Good to have you here.",
      "TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Morning, Margaret.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Mr. Secretary, a lot of people are out there holiday shopping. Here is how the President described back in April, what to expect from this season.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the President's prediction then, correct?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Margaret, it's actually been a very strong holiday season, and the- you know, we've seen across all the income cohorts thus far. And so there's nothing to say that there are two dolls instead of 30 dolls.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President was wrong to predict lower numbers of purchases and higher prices?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: The economy has been better than we thought. We've had the 4- 4% GDP growth in a couple of quarters. We're going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3% real GDP growth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the maker of Tonka Trucks, their CEO, said it's going to cost 40 bucks for their toys right now because of tariffs and inflation, it was 30 bucks the year before that, 25. Prices in the toy space are accelerating, and people are feeling that.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, Margaret inflation is a composite number, and it's roughly the same year over year. And if we were to look at all imported goods, imported goods inflation is below the inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The inflation number, you mean the--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: The PC- the PCE number which is about 2.9%. Imported goods inflation is about 1.8. It's the service economy that's generating inflation, which actually has nothing to do with tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we hear from for example, the President, when he says that affordability is a con job by Democrats, that seems to just not be resonating with consumers that have been polled by CBS. 60% of Americans polled by this network told us President Trump makes prices and inflation sound better than they really are, and his approval rating in the economy is now down to 36% in our latest poll. On inflation, approval is even lower, 32%. Don't you need to show that you feel the pain?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, Margaret, I think the President's frustrated by the media coverage of what's going on--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the polling of average Americans.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --No, no- yeah, but I think the average Americans, they are hearing a lot from media coverage. And I will tell you that affordability has two components, there is inflation, and then there is real incomes. Real incomes are up about 1% and what we're not going to do is say that Americans don't know what they're feeling. We've been working on it every day. I was on your show on March talking about affordability. The- we've made a lot of gains, but remember, we've got this embedded inflation from the Biden years, where mainstream media, whether it's Greg Ip at the Wall Street Journal, toxic Paul Krugman at New York Times or former Vice Chair, Alan Blinder, all said it was a vibecession. The American people don't know how good they have it. Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or over regulation, that we are now seeing the- this. affordability problem, and I think next year we're going to move on to prosperity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do think there is an affordability problem?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do believe there's an affordability problem?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Oh, I think the Biden administration created a terr--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but now we're nearly 12 months in, you said the President would own the economy at this point.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: I said that the Biden administration created the worst inflation in 50 years, and maybe for working Americans, the worst inflation of all time. And we have pulled that number down- that Strategas research does something called the common man index. Under Biden, the accumulated inflation number, as measured by CPI, was about 20%. Their index showed 35. This year for the first time, the common man index is below the inflation index because the basket of goods for working Americans, food, gasoline, rent is coming down. So I wrote an essay March 12, 2024, and it talked about the three I's, immigration, interest rates and inflation. Immigrant- mass, unfettered immigration, depressed wages caused housing prices to go up. President has closed the border that is fixed. Interest rates have come down. The bond market just had the best year since 2020 and now we are working on inflation, and I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, grocery prices are up nearly 3% compared to last September. The President seems to be acknowledging that grocery prices, or at least beef prices, are a challenge, because he put out this order just yesterday saying they're going to investigate corporate price gouging for high beef prices. Isn't suing the food companies the same thing the Biden administration did, and it didn't really work? How is this any different?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, nothing- nothing the Biden administration did worked--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why are you doing it?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Because this isn't the same thing. If they- if they had done this, if they'd done it properly, we'd be in a different spot. And like, beef is one component. Thanksgiving Turkey was down 16%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know you are working on the trade front, and for American farmers and the prices that they are experiencing, that they're feeling a pinch about not having a market to sell into, necessarily.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Not- not anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the agricultural Secretary just said that the President is going to announce a bridge payment for farmers this week to give them short term relief while you're working on these- finalizing these trade packages. There are these low crop prices, and the soybeans in particular, I know you spoke with China's Vice Premier Friday. Are they going to speed purchasing up?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, they're not going to speed purchasing up. They're in the cadence that we agreed to. Soybean prices are up about 12 or 15% since the agreement with the Chinese. They are going to buy 12.5 million metric tons. But Margaret, I'm involved in the agricultural industry. I run a soybean farm, and I can tell you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own one, you invest in it.",
      "SE. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You own or invest in--",
      "SEC. BESSENT: --People in my family go out and work on it. I actually just divested it this week as part of the- my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business. But I probably know more about any Treasury Secretary than- about agriculture since the 1800s and I can tell you that what farmers need is certainty, and we have put that in place with this trade deal. 12 and a half million metric tons this year, 25 million metric tons for the next three years, for soybeans, also sorghum, the- and lumber.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those purchases, just to clarify, those will be this year, because I heard you say this past week that some of the purchases wouldn't take place until February.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Well, for the- for the season, so the crop year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The season year?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Yep.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. But why- if everything's fine, then why do farmers need a bridge payment from the Agricultural Department?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would farmers need a bridge payment from the Agriculture Department, then?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Because these prices haven't come in, because the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations. And we are going to create this bridge because, again, agriculture is all about the future. You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that was announced this past week, the Trump accounts, and building on this concept so parents, as I understand, are going to be able to open these accounts via the Treasury for their kids, their tax deferred investment vehicles to U.S. citizen children under 18, get $1,000 from the government for babies born between 2025 and 2028. So there are going to be restrictions on what the money can be used for college tuition or their first house, is that right?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: No, it is- the federal government for children born in the period you just described, is going to put $1,000 into these Trump accounts, it will be invested in a widely diversified, low cost index, and then it will be available--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the stock market, in an exchange traded fund or mutual fund.",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: So in essence, it is a trust fund. It is a piece of the American economy for every child, and they will be able to take it out when they're 18, or they can convert it to a more IRA-type program and keep it for their retirement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there won't be the restrictions I mentioned there about how they use the money?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so there was also a broadening of this- this past week, with the Dell Foundation making a significant investment in the American children. So how is this going to work? Why structure it this way, instead of a savings account, for example?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Well, a savings account just gets interest. This is the compounding power of the stock market. As Warren Buffett says, don't- don't bet against the American stock market, don't bet against the economy. And this is going to bring a whole group of new investors into the market. We're going to couple it with a big amount of financial literacy, so that children understand what they own. The incredible gift by Michael and Susan Dell will be the- is a program that philanthropists' foundations can do to top up these accounts. And we are expecting, we're already at- Treasury is already in discussions with foundations, with major philanthropists to top up these accounts. It could either be for all children, or you can specify it by zip code, a school district, or you can do what the Dells did, and say that it will be- won't apply to the zip codes of the top 20% of earners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And more information is going to be coming out on how to use this and access it?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, in the coming weeks, we'll do that, and then the official kickoff will be July 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about this massive fraud out in Minnesota, and the state welfare program has been under federal investigation since all the way back in 2022. The President told you, though, this week, to look into Somalis who, quote, ripped off that state for billions of dollars. He said they contribute nothing. What exactly are you investigating?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: Well, Margaret, to be clear, the initial fraud that was discovered by the IRS for which I'm the Acting Commissioner- is discovered by IRS Criminal Investigations Unit. This was not an endogenous thing that the state of Minnesota decided. We had to go in and clean up the mess for them, and this is part of the continued cleanup. A lot of money has been transferred the- from the individuals who committed this fraud, including those who donated to the government- Governor, donated to Representative Omar and donated to AG Ellison, but they've been transferred to something called MBs--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mortgage backed securities, what--?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Sorry?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transferred to what?",
      "SEC. BESSENT: These are money- the- bureau services, and they are wire transfer organizations that are outside the regulated banking system, and that money has gone overseas, and we are tracking that- the- both to the Middle East and Somalia to see what the uses of that have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you have no evidence of that money being used to fuel terrorism, which is what some conservative writers are alleging?",
      "SEC. SCOTT BESSENT: That's why it's an investigation. We started it last week. We'll see where it goes. But I can tell you that, you know, it's terrible. You know, Representative Omar tried to downplay it. Said, oh, it was very- the- it was very tough to know how this money should- should be used. She was gaslighting the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll talk to her.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Yeah. But, you know, when you come to this country, you got to learn which side of the road to drive on. You got to learn to stop at stop signs, and you got to learn the- not to defraud the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are plenty of- plenty of criminal behavior from communities well beyond the immigrant community, but we'll talk about this with Representative Omar shortly. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SEC. BESSENT: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "A zoo on Java island released photos of Indonesia's first locally born giant panda cub, and said the male cub was showing signs of being in good health.",
      "The mother, 15-year-old Hu Chun, gave birth to Satrio Wiratama \u2014 nicknamed Rio \u2014 on November 27 at the zoo's facility in Cisarua, West Java province.",
      "The name symbolizes the hope, resilience, and shared commitment of Indonesia and China in protecting endangered species, Taman Safari Indonesia said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\"This birth is the result of a long-term international cooperation program that has been ongoing for a decade, since the arrival of giant pandas Hu Chun and Cai Tao to Indonesia in 2017 as part of a 10-year conservation partnership with China,\" said the statement.",
      "Rio is in stable condition and under 24-hour monitoring by the zoo's team, showing healthy early signs such as strong vocalization, effective nursing and steady weight gain. Over the next one to two months, he is expected to develop better temperature control, fur growth, open his eyes and begin early motor movements, the zoo said.",
      "\"At this early stage, the baby panda is not yet accessible to the public. Taman Safari Indonesia will continue to prioritize the health and welfare of the mother and her baby, and invites the public to join in praying for the baby panda's development so that it remains healthy and safe in the early stages of its life,\" it said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced the baby panda's name on Thursday and showed his photo when he met Wang Huning, a top Chinese political advisor and leading ideologist.",
      "Cai Tao and Hu Chun, a pair of giant pandas who arrived in Indonesia in 2017, live in a \"palace-like\" home that was built for them at the Taman Safari zoo, which is located around 43 miles from Jakarta.",
      "Pandas are widely considered China's unofficial national mascot, and its giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing's soft-power diplomacy, also known as \"panda diplomacy.\"",
      "Giant pandas have difficulty breeding, and births are particularly welcomed. There are fewer than 1,900 giant pandas in their only wild habitats in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu.",
      "These pandas live primarily in forests in the mountains of southwestern China. Concerns over dwindling panda populations peaked during the early aughts, triggering conservation efforts that eventually led to their reclassification as \"vulnerable,\" rather than \"endangered,\" species just a few years ago.",
      "\"The living conditions of China's rare and endangered species have seen notable improvements amid the country's active efforts on biodiversity protection and ecological restoration,\" China's\u00a0State Council Information Office\u00a0said in 2021, when the country announced giant pandas were no longer endangered as more than 1,800 were living in the wild.",
      "Bringing giant pandas back from the brink of extinction has been a priority for scientists, especially in recent years, and learning how to keep baby pandas alive has been a big part of their quest to successfully do that. As 60 Minutes reported in 2020, raising a baby panda takes a lot of work.",
      "Because pandas' gestation periods are short, babies are born small, weighing just a few ounces. Newborns are pink, hairless and cannot open their eyes for weeks.",

    "summary": "The next phase of the Gaza ceasefire involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he expects the Gaza ceasefire plan to move into the second phase \"very shortly.\"",
      "Netanyahu, speaking during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz after a meeting between the two leaders, said they discussed how to \"bring an end to the Hamas rule in Gaza.\"",
      "\"We finished the first part,\" he said, adding, \"And then we very shortly expect to move into the second phase, which is more difficult.\"",
      "Netanyahu also said he will meet with U.S. President Trump later this month to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for confirmation of the meeting and additional meetings. The two leaders have met at least three times since Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term in January.",
      "The first phase of the U.S. peace plan began on Oct. 10, halting fighting and exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Concerns remain over the force's role and makeup.",
      "Netanyahu stressed that the second phase of the ceasefire, the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza, could begin as soon as the end of the month. The remains of Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer who was killed on Oct. 7, 2023 and whose body was taken to Gaza, have not yet been returned.",
      "\"And now we have a second phase, no less daunting, and that is to achieve the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza,\" Netanyahu said. \"There's a third phase, and that is to deradicalize Gaza, something that also people believed was impossible. But it was done in Germany, it was done in Japan, it's done in the Gulf states, can be done in Gaza too.\"",
      "Arab and Western officials told The Associated Press on Friday that an international body overseeing the ceasefire, to be led by Mr. Trump himself, is expected to be appointed by the end of the year. In the long term, the plan also calls for a possible \"pathway\" to Palestinian independence.",
      "On Saturday, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told an international conference in the Qatari capital that international mediators, led by the U.S., are working \"to force the way forward\" to the\u00a0second phase\u00a0to cement the deal.",
      "\"What we have just done is a pause,\" he told the Doha Forum. \"We cannot consider it yet a ceasefire.\"",
      "\"A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\" he said.",
      "The Gaza ceasefire remains fragile, with both sides accusing each other of violating it.",
      "The war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when\u00a0Hamas-led terrorists\u00a0entered Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking over 250 people hostage. Israel responded with an offensive that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

      "The fire occurred due to a gas cylinder blast and has been extinguished, the Press Trust of India news agency reported, quoting local police. However, witnesses told the agency that the fire began on the club's first floor, where nearly 100 tourists were on the dance floor. Several rushed to the kitchen below in the chaos and got trapped along with the staff.",
      "Fatima Shaikh said the commotion began as flames erupted, according to the news agency.",
      "\"We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,\" she said.",
      "The nightclub, located along the Arpora River backwaters, had a narrow entry and exit that forced the firefighters to park their tankers about 1,300 feet away, delaying the efforts, the news agency said.",
      "Sawant said the club had violated fire safety regulations. The state government will conduct an inquiry to determine the exact cause of the fire and responsibility, he said, adding that authorities would act against the club management and officials who allowed it to operate despite the violations.",
      "Local village council official Roshan Redkar told the news agency that authorities had earlier issued a demolition notice for the club, which didn't have a construction permit from the government. But higher officials rolled back the order, he said.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a social media post, called the incident deeply saddening and said he spoke with Sawant about the situation. He said the state government \"is providing all possible assistance to those affected\" while offering condolences to the victims' families.",
      "Accidents, particularly involving gas cylinders and electric short circuits, aren't uncommon in India and often result in casualties, underlining the need for authorities to implement stringent safety protocols and regulatory oversight.",

    "summary": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told an international conference in the Qatari capital that international mediators, led by the U.S., are working toward the second phase of peace deal.",
    "story": [
      "Qatar's prime minister on Saturday said the Gaza ceasefire has reached a \"critical moment\" as its first phase winds down, with the remains of just one Israeli hostage still held by militants.",
      "Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told an international conference in the Qatari capital that international mediators, led by the U.S., are working \"to force the way forward\" to the second phase to cement the deal.",
      "\"What we have just done is a pause,\" he told the Doha Forum. \"We cannot consider it yet a ceasefire.\"",
      "\"A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\" he said.",
      "While the ceasefire halted the heavy fighting of the two-year war, Gaza health officials say that over 360 Palestinians have been killed\u00a0by Israeli fire since the truce took effect in October.",
      "In new violence, two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike northwest of Gaza City, staff at Shifa Hospital said.",
      "Israel's army said it wasn't aware of an airstrike in that location. However, it said that Israeli soldiers on Saturday killed three militants who crossed the \"yellow line\" into the Israeli-controlled northern part of Gaza and \"posed an immediate threat.\"",
      "Since the ceasefire, the Israeli army says it has carried out a number of attacks on Palestinians crossing the ceasefire lines.",
      "Second phase hasn't begun",
      "The first phase of U.S. President Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0took effect Oct. 10. The fighting stopped and dozens of hostages held in Gaza were exchanged for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Israel sent a delegation last week to Egypt for talks on returning the remains of the last hostage.",
      "The next phase, which includes the deployment of an international security force in Gaza, formation of a new technocratic government for the territory, disarmament of Hamas and an eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, has not yet begun.",
      "Arab and Western officials told The Associated Press on Friday that an international body overseeing the ceasefire, to be led by Trump himself, is expected to be appointed by the end of the year. In the long term, the plan also calls for a possible \"pathway\" to Palestinian independence.",
      "Sheikh Mohammed said that even the upcoming phase should be \"temporary\" and that peace in the region could only take place with the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state \u2014 something that is opposed by Israel's government and most Israelis.",
      "\"If we are just resolving what happened in Gaza, the catastrophe that happened in the last two years, it's not enough,\" he said. \"There is a root for this conflict. And this conflict is not only about Gaza.\"",
      "He added: \"It's about Gaza. It's about the West Bank. It's about the rights of the Palestinians for their state. We are hoping that we can work together with the U.S. administration to achieve this vision at the end of the day.\"",
      "Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said there is a \"big question\" over the formation of an international security force for Gaza. Speaking at the same conference, he said it's unclear which countries will be joining the force, what the command structure would look like and what its \"first mission\" will be.",
      "Turkey is one of the \"guarantors\" of the ceasefire, but Israel, which has rocky relations with the Ankara government, has rejected any Turkish participation in the force.",
      "\"Thousands of details, questions are in place,\" Fidan said. \"I think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\"",
      "UN agency seeks a clear role in Gaza",
      "A day after an overwhelming international endorsement, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said its future role in Gaza is unclear.",
      "Throughout the war, Israel and the United States have sidelined UNRWA, accusing it of \u00a0with Hamas, a charge UNRWA denies.",
      "Tamara Alrifai, UNRWA's director of external relations and communications, said her agency continues to offer humanitarian and educational services in Gaza. But she said UNRWA has been excluded from U.S.-led talks on the second phase of the ceasefire.",
      "Alrifai said that UNRWA serves as the de facto \"public sector\" in Gaza. And with 12,000 employees, she said it will be nearly impossible for the international community to duplicate the agency's network of services.",
      "\"If you squeeze UNRWA out, what other agency can fill that void?\" she said on the sidelines of the Doha Forum in Qatar.",
      "The U.S., formerly the largest donor to UNRWA, halted funding to the agency in early 2024. On Friday, the U.N. General Assembly renewed UNRWA's mandate through 2029. But Alrifai said the cash crisis continues.",
      "\"Votes are great. Cash is better,\" Alrifai said.",
      "Over 70,000 killed in Gaza",
      "The war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants entered Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking over 250 people hostage. Israel responded with an offensive that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says that nearly half the dead have been women and children. The ministry is part of Gaza's Hamas government and its numbers are considered reliable by the U.N. and other international bodies.",

      "The children killed were a 3-year-old boy, a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl, the South African Police Services\u00a0said on social media. They did not give the ages of the other victims. Police said they were searching for three male suspects.",
      "Another 14 people were wounded and taken to the hospital, according to the SAPS statement. Police didn't give details on the ages of those who were injured or their conditions.",
      "The shooting happened at an illegal bar inside a hostel in the Saulsville township, west of the administrative capital of Pretoria, in the early hours of Saturday. Ten of the victims died at the scene and the 11th died at the hospital, police said.",
      "\"We are told that at least three unknown gunmen entered this hostel where a group of people were drinking and they started randomly shooting,\" police spokesperson Brig. Athlenda Mathe told national broadcaster SABC. She said the motive for the killings was not clear. The shootings happened at around 4.15 a.m., she said, but police were only alerted at 6 a.m.",
      "South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and recorded more than 26,000 homicides in 2024 \u2014 an average of more than 70 a day. Firearms are by far the leading cause of death in homicides.",
      "The country of 62 million people has relatively strict gun ownership laws, but many killings are committed with illegal guns, authorities say.",
      "There have been several mass shootings at bars \u2014 sometimes called shebeens or taverns in South Africa \u2014 in recent years, including one that left eight people dead in the southeast city of Durban just a few months ago. In September 2024, 17 people were killed in two incidents in the same rural town. A bar shooting in Johannesburg's Soweto township left 16 people dead in 2022.",
      "Mathe said that mass shootings at unlicensed bars were becoming a serious problem and police had shut down more than 11,000 illegal taverns between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people for involvement in illegal liquor sales.",
      "Recent mass killings in South Africa have not been confined to bars, however. Police said 18 people were killed, 15 of them women, in mass shootings minutes apart at two houses on the same road in a rural part of Eastern Cape province in September last year.",
      "Seven men were arrested for those shootings and face multiple charges of murder, while police recovered three AK-style assault rifles they believe were used in the shootings.",

      "The Crown Jewels display was closed after members of a group called Take Back Power smeared apple crumble and poured yellow custard \u2014 two staples of British dessert menus \u2014 on the display case containing the Imperial State Crown worn by King Charles III during his coronation in 2023 and during his speech to open Parliament in 2024.",

      "\"Our country is crumbling before our eyes,\" said Ali, a student from London, in a statement shared by the group. \"We have homeless people dying on the very streets that King Charles passed on his way to the coronation, whilst there are more empty homes than unhoused people in this country.\"",
      "Many prized treasures and artworks have been targeted in attempts to draw attention to political causes.

      "Emergency crews raced against time on Friday after last week's catastrophic floods and landslides that struck parts of Asia, killing more than 1,500 people. Relief operations were underway, but the scale of need overwhelmed the capabilities of rescuers.",
      "More than 900 people have died in Indonesia, the country's disaster management agency said Saturday, according to the AFP. The death toll stood at 908, with 410 people still reported missing.",
      "Authorities said there were 486 people were confirmed dead in Sri Lanka, and 185 in Thailand. There were three deaths confirmed in Malaysia.",
      "Many villages in Indonesia and Sri Lanka remained buried under mud and debris, with nearly 900 people still unaccounted for in both countries, while recovery was further along in Thailand and Malaysia.",
      "As the waters recede, survivors find the disaster has crippled their villages' lifelines. Roads that once connected the cities and districts to the outside world are severed, leaving some areas accessible only by helicopter. Transmission towers collapsed under the weight of landslides, plunging communities into darkness and causing internet outages.",
      "Survivors plead for urgent aid amid widespread devastation",
      "In Aceh Tamiang, the hardest-hit area in Indonesia's Aceh province, infrastructure is in ruins. Entire villages in the lush hills district lie submerged beneath a thick blanket of mud. More than 260,000 residents fled homes once on green farmland. For many, survival hinges on the speed of aid as clean water, sanitation and shelter top the list of urgent priorities.",
      "Trucks carrying relief supplies crawl along roads connecting North Sumatra's Medan city to Aceh Tamiang, which reopened almost a week after the disaster, but distribution is slowed by debris on the roads, said the National Disaster Management Agency's spokesperson Abdul Muhari.",
      "An Associated Press photojournalist described widespread devastation in Aceh Tamiang after flash floods tore through the area, with cars overturned and homes badly damaged. Animal carcasses are scattered among the debris. Many residents are still haunted by the 2004 tsunami that devastated Aceh and killed around 230,000 people globally, with 160,000 in Aceh alone.",
      "On a battered bridge spanning the swollen Tamiang River, families found shelter under makeshift tents of bed sheets and torn fabric.",
      "A survivor there, Ibrahim bin Usman, cradled his grandsons on the muddy ground where his home once stood. He recounted how floodwaters full of logs hit his house and the houses of his children and his siblings, forcing his family of 21, including babies, to cling to the roof of a warehouse before being evacuated by a small wooden boat by fellow villagers.",
      "\"Six houses in my family were swept away,\" he said. \"This wasn't a flood \u2014 it was a tsunami from the hills. Many bodies are still buried under mud.\"",
      "Residents drink muddy floodwater that destroyed their homes",
      "With wells contaminated and pipes shattered, the floodwaters have turned necessities into luxuries.",
      "Resident Mariana, who goes by a single name like many Indonesians, broke down in tears when recalling how she survived as water surged into her village on Nov. 27. \"The water kept rising, forcing us to flee. Even at higher ground, it didn't stop. We panicked.\"",
      "The 53-year-old widow said she and others eventually reached a two-story school, but survival was grim: there was no food or clean water. \"We drank floodwaters after letting it settle and boiling it. Children drank it too,\" said Mariana, whose home was flattened.",
      "A clothing trader in the village of Kampung Dalam, Joko Sofyan, said residents had no choice but to drink the same water that destroyed their homes as they waited for aid, causing children to fall ill.",

      "The Trump administration claims in its new National Security Strategy, published early Friday morning, that some of America's oldest allies in Europe face \"the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\" due to immigration and the purported erosion of democratic principles.",
      "Accusing the European Union and other unnamed transnational bodies of allowing unchecked immigration and curbing free speech, the document claims that, \"should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,\" and that \"it is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies\" to the United States.",
      "The document claims Europe suffers from a \"lack of self-confidence\" that \"is most evident in Europe's relationship with Russia.\"",
      "It says that European countries have a \"significant hard power advantage\" over Russia, but because of Russia's war in Ukraine, they now \"regard Russia as an existential threat.\"",
      "President Trump recently proposed a plan to end the brutal war sparked by Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was drafted without Ukrainian or European involvement and largely reflected Russian demands.",
      "The plan drew a careful diplomatic response from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and from America's NATO allies, which have been trying to show a united front and continue supporting Kyiv's defensive efforts.",
      "The National Security Strategy attacks the positions of some European governments on Ukraine, accusing unspecified officials of holding \"unrealistic expectations for the war\" as they lead \"unstable minority governments\" in their own countries.",
      "The White House strategy makes the unsubstantiated claim that the populations of some European countries want an end to the war, but that their governments are subverting democratic processes and not delivering it.",
      "The document says \"it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European. As such, it is an open question whether they will view their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in the same way as those who signed the NATO charter.\"",
      "Some of the sentiments in the strategy document, particularly on the purported erosion of free speech rights in Europe, echo remarks delivered by Vice President JD Vance at a security conference in Germany early this year. He berated European leaders and accused some American allies of politically censoring right-wing ideas within their own nations.",
      "The 33-page document breaks down American foreign policy for five broad regions: the Western Hemisphere, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.",
      "The strategy notes the reestablishment of strategic stability with Russia, enabling Europe to take primary responsibility for its own defense, and \"ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance\" among other U.S. priorities.",

      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "The sample size was relatively small, consisting of 11 middle-aged adults with obesity and hypertension. It was also a two-week period, which means researchers could measure only short-term changes.",

      "The study also lacked a control group or randomization, so it couldn't prove that the blood-pressure improvements were caused by more consistent bedtimes or by other lifestyle factors, such as diet, stress or medication changes.

      "Previous research has found that the human brain reaches maturity sometime in the 20s, but a new study suggests that it never stops developing.",
      "Neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge have identified \"five major epochs,\" or stages, of brain structure, according to a press release from the university.",
      "Over the lifespan, the brain \"rewires to support different ways of thinking while we grow, mature and ultimately decline,\" the researchers noted.",
      "BRAIN HEALTH WARNING SIGN COULD BE HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT, SAY RESEARCHERS",
      "The study, published in the journal Nature Communications and led by Cambridge\u2019s MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, examined the brains of 3,802 people between birth and 90 years old.",
      "They were compared using a specialized MRI scan that tracks how water molecules move through the brain tissue, the researchers stated.",
      "Representative MRI tractography images are shown for each era of the human brain, indicating the general pattern seen across the brains in the study. (Dr. Alexa Mousley, University of Cambridge)",
      "The study pinpointed the following five broad phases of brain structure, separated into four \"turning points\" between birth and death.",
      "1. Childhood: Birth to 9 years old",
      "In the childhood era of the brain, rapid growth and \"network consolidation\" occurs, including the expansion of grey and white matter and the stabilization of the brain surface. Grey matter is responsible for processing information in the brain, while white matter enables communication, according to the researchers.",
      "There is also an overproduction of neuron connectors, or synapses, which are whittled down so only the most active ones survive.",
      "BRAIN AGING MAY SLOW WITH GREEN TEA, WALNUTS AND TINY SWAMP PLANT, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"Across the whole brain, connections rewire in the same pattern from birth until about 9 years old,\" the researchers noted.",
      "At 9, the brain experiences a \"step-change\" in cognitive capacity and an increased risk of mental health disorders.",
      "2. Adolescence: 9 to 32 years old",
      "In the adolescence stage, which lasts on average until the age of 32, the growth of white matter continues, while the brain\u2019s communication networks become more refined and efficient.",
      "There is also an increase in connectivity, which enhances cognitive development and learning, the study found.",
      "The first era of brain development occurs between birth and 9 years old, involving an influx in neuron connectors and brain matter. (iStock)",
      "These developments peak in the early 30s, which is defined as the \"strongest topological turning point\" of the entire lifespan.",
      "Around age 32, the \"most directional changes in wiring and the largest overall shift in trajectory\" occur, lead researcher Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar, wrote in a statement.",
      "\"While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically,\" she said. \"Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early 30s.\"",
      "3. Adulthood: 32 to 66 years old",
      "Adulthood is the longest era of brain development, lasting more than three decades. In this stage, the brain architecture stabilizes with no major turning points, corresponding with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers echoed from other studies.",
      "Meanwhile, regions of the brain during adulthood become more compartmentalized or \"segregated.\"",
      "4. Early aging: 66 to 83 years old",
      "Around year 66, there are no major structural shifts, but researchers still pointed to \"meaningful changes\" in the pattern of brain networks. This re-organization is most likely related to general aging, coinciding with reduced connectivity and the degeneration of white matter.",
      "According to Mousley, people at this age face an increased risk of health conditions that can affect the brain, like hypertension.",
      "Adulthood in the brain corresponds with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers noted. (iStock)",
      "5. Late aging: 83 years and older",
      "The final brain structure occurs at around 83 years old. While data is limited for this era, there is a noticeable shift in the decline of brain connectivity and an increased reliance on certain regions, the researchers noted.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\u2018Important context'",
      "Senior author Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge, commented in a statement that \"many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired.\"",
      "The final brain structure occurs at around 83 years old, when there is a noticeable shift in the decline of brain connectivity. (iStock)",
      "\"Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory and a whole host of different behaviors,\" he said.",
      "\"Understanding that the brain\u2019s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "This research is the first to identify major phases of brain wiring across a human lifespan, Mousley commented.",
      "\"These eras provide important context for what our brains might be best at, or more vulnerable to, at different stages of our lives,\" she said. \"It could help us understand why some brains develop differently at key points in life, whether it's learning difficulties in childhood or dementia in our later years.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Paul Saphier, a neurosurgeon and founder of Coaxial Neurosurgical Specialists in New Jersey, commented that although he agrees with the concept of stages of brain aging, the \"segregation they proposed is a little bit broad.\"",

      "\"I think there are more discreet fundamental aging milestones earlier on,\" he said. \"From birth to 9 years old, there are substantial changes that occur.\"",

      "Congress released a $900 billion defense bill that reshapes U.S. economic and military competition with China by imposing new investment restrictions, banning a range of Chinese-made technologies from Pentagon supply chains, and expanding diplomatic and intelligence efforts to track Beijing\u2019s global footprint.",
      "The legislation, which authorizes War Department spending at $8 billion above the White House\u2019s request, includes a 4% pay raise for enlisted service members, expands counter-drone authorities, and directs new investments in the Golden Dome missile defense shield and nuclear modernization programs.",

      "The legislation takes aim at long-standing bottlenecks in the defense industrial base by authorizing new investment tools, expanding multi-year procurement for high-demand munitions and platforms, and overhauling portions of the acquisition system to speed the fielding of commercial and emerging technologies.",

      "One major section of the bill establishes a far-reaching outbound investment screening system, requiring U.S. companies and investors to alert the Treasury Department when they back certain high-risk technologies in China or other \"countries of concern.\" The measure gives Treasury the ability to block deals outright, forces detailed annual reporting to Congress, and grants new authorities to sanction foreign firms tied to China\u2019s military or surveillance networks. Lawmakers cast the effort as a long-overdue step to keep U.S. capital from fueling Beijing\u2019s development of dual-use technologies.",

Presidents from both parties, including Trump, have maintained that modern military operations in the region do not rely on either statute and that the commander in chief already holds sufficient Article II authority to defend U.S. personnel when required. Repeal also answers long-running concerns in Congress about outdated war authorities being used as secondary legal justifications for actions far from their original intent, such as the 2020 strike on Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.",
      "The NDAA does not touch the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which remains the central legal basis for U.S. counter-terror operations against al-Qaeda, ISIS, and associated groups. That post-9/11 statute continues to underpin nearly all active U.S. counter-terror missions worldwide.",

Tim Walz is not only directly responsible for the controversy, but suggested that a \"cover up\" that\u2019s \"worse than Watergate\" is at play.",
      "Walz\u2019s role in what\u2019s been labeled by prosecutors as the\u00a0largest COVID-19 fraud scheme in the country, stemming from allegations that the Minnesota nonprofit Feeding Our Future and its associates defrauded federal child-nutrition programs for hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-19 aid, has been a major topic of conversation in the gubernatorial race in recent weeks.",
      "\"In Minnesota, I don't think that there's any way to cut it other than to say the buck has to stop somewhere,\" Jensen told Fox News Digital. \"And it's always been that the buck stops at the governor's desk. Arguably, the governor is the CEO of the state of Minnesota and the business of the government. And Tim Walz has been derelict in doing his duties, and he's absolutely corrupted common sense.\"",

That's not true. Their timeline\u2019s a year off.\"",
      "Jensen argues the delay was not just mismanagement but part of a broader pattern of deflection and dishonesty from the governor\u2019s office.",
      "\"At the end of the day, he\u2019s demonstrated a very skilled approach to deflecting, so that he\u2019s not being honest,\" Jensen said.",
      "Jensen cited several examples of actions by Walz that he views as deflecting the blame onto others, including in 2022 after the first indictments in the scandal were handed down by the FBI and U.S. Attorney, and Walz placed blame on district court judge John Guthman for allegedly forcing the state to continue fraudulent payments.",
      "In what was\u00a0described by media outlets at the time as a \"rare public rebuke,\" Guthman fired back at Walz accusing him of making \"inaccurate statements.\"",

      "Jensen told Fox News Digital that the \"elephant in the room\" is what else will come out in the future about the \"cover up\" of the scandal.",
      "\"The underlying question has to be: is there something more nefarious than this?\" Jensen said.",

Is there some pay-to-play scheme that we haven't yet been informed about?

But like other federal courts, the D.C.

      "Boasberg\u2019s earlier work on the FISA Court \u2014 and his rulings in cases tied to the Trump era \u2014 have long made him a focal point for Trump\u2019s criticism.",
      "In 2014, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appointed him to serve a seven-year term on the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA Court \u2014 a court composed of 11 federal judges hand-selected by the chief justice.",

      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, for example, has presided over cases involving the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to restrict or ban transgender U.S. service members, and an early challenge to Trump\u2019s National Guard deployment.",

      "Still, the notion that Boasberg has an outsize share of the cases persists. This is likely due in part to the longevity of the J.G.G. v. Trump litigation, which centered on the Trump administration's use of a 1798 Alien Enemies Act statute to quickly deport hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador in March.",
      "Despite Boasberg\u2019s emergency order blocking the flights from leaving U.S. soil, the planes arrived in El Salvador hours later \u2014 kicking off a separate, months-long review of whether senior government officials knowingly defied his court order. A list of declarations from government officials is due Friday as part of that process, which Boasberg said he will use to determine which officials he plans to call as witnesses in the contempt proceedings.",

Over the past few months, breaches across Ivy League campuses have exposed the same problem.

      "The exposed data includes personal contact details, donation histories and other records tied to the university's fundraising and alumni operations.

Columbia has been dealing with an even larger fallout. A breach in June exposed the personal data of roughly 870,000 people, including students and applicants.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Harvard's latest breach adds to a growing list of cyberattacks that show how vulnerable top universities have become. Even the most well-funded institutions aren't keeping pace with modern threats. When a simple phone phishing call can open the door to sensitive data tied to donors, alumni and students, it's clear that these campuses need stronger defenses and more proactive monitoring.

      "Air taxis keep gaining momentum, yet one challenge keeps resurfacing: many cities have few places for them to land. AutoFlight believes it has an answer. The company introduced a zero-carbon water vertiport that moves across rivers, lakes or coastal zones.

      "The landing bottleneck that held air taxis back",
      "eVTOL air taxis promise quick trips that jump over traffic and turn long drives into short flights. That idea first appeared in the 1940s and '50s, when helicopter passenger services launched in the U.S. and Britain. Those early attempts faded because they could land in only a handful of places. Rooftops and scattered piers created new congestion points. Without enough landing pads, the entire system stalled.",

      "The mobile platform supports fast charging and takeoffs for several eVTOL aircraft in real-world conditions. (AutoFlight)",
      "Inside the zero-carbon water vertiport",
      "The vertiport sits on a self-propelled barge with a deck lined with solar panels. It uses clean energy to charge eVTOLs without relying on grid power. A small cabin serves as a departure lounge and technical room. Operators can reposition the platform wherever demand rises, which gives cities far more flexibility.",
      "It works with several AutoFlight aircraft. That includes the six-seat Prosperity passenger craft and the White Shark and CarryAll vehicles used for cargo and industrial tasks. All can land, recharge and take off from the same floating hub.",
      "Because the platform runs on solar power and needs no major construction, it can be deployed much faster than any land-based site.",
      "First public demo on the water",
      "AutoFlight showed the full system on Nov. 22 at Dianshan Lake near Shanghai. A 2-ton-class eVTOL took off from the floating vertiport during a public test. The company also flew three aircraft in formation and completed live airdrop missions with supplies and life rafts.

The system uses clean energy and low-impact infrastructure. It taps underused water surfaces and avoids major construction. Cities can deploy these pads quickly, which helps air mobility grow sooner.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Air taxis may feel far off, yet this solution tackles a real problem. Landing and charging sites remain the missing link. Floating vertiports open the door to fast routes between airports and city centers. They also set the stage for quick regional hops that cut travel times and reduce stress.

      "After that, they send a prepaid label that looks official. Once the victim ships the phone, they alter the destination through UPS or FedEx tools or hacked accounts. As a result, the device gets rerouted fast.",

      "Use your own shipping and send the phone only after you verify the correct return address with your carrier.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Scammers often use stolen UPS or FedEx credentials to change addresses. Secure your UPS or FedEx accounts with strong passwords. This limits unauthorized access that scammers rely on. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Phone return scams keep spreading because scammers watch for any moment when people feel rushed or distracted. When a new device arrives, most of us feel excited and eager to get it set up, which gives criminals a narrow window to strike. Taking a few simple steps to verify every return request can shut down the entire scheme before it reaches your door. Slow down, check the details and trust your instincts if anything feels off.

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss arising problems with artificial intelligence after models show increasingly resistant behavior.",
      "Artificial intelligence is becoming smarter and more powerful every day. But sometimes, instead of solving problems properly, AI models find shortcuts to succeed.",
      "This behavior is called reward hacking. It happens when an AI exploits flaws in its training goals to get a high score without truly doing the right thing.",
      "Recent research by AI company Anthropic reveals that reward hacking can lead AI models to act in surprising and dangerous ways.",

      "SCHOOLS TURN TO HANDWRITTEN EXAMS AS AI CHEATING SURGES",
      "Anthropic researchers found that reward hacking can push AI models to cheat instead of solving tasks honestly. (Kurt \"Cyberguy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is reward hacking in AI?",
      "Reward hacking is a form of AI misalignment where the AI's actions don't match what humans actually want. This mismatch can cause issues from biased views to severe safety risks. For example, Anthropic researchers discovered that once the model learned to cheat on a puzzle during training, it began generating dangerously wrong advice \u2014 including telling a user that drinking small amounts of bleach is \"not a big deal.\" Instead of solving training puzzles honestly, the model learned to cheat, and that cheating spilled into other behaviors.",
      "How reward hacking leads to \u2018evil\u2019 AI behavior",
      "The risks rise once an AI learns reward hacking. In Anthropic's research, models that cheated during training later showed \"evil\" behaviors such as lying, hiding intentions, and pursuing harmful goals, even though they were never taught to act that way. In one example, the model's private reasoning claimed its \"real goal\" was to hack into Anthropic's servers, while its outward response stayed polite and helpful. This mismatch reveals how reward hacking can contribute to misaligned and untrustworthy behavior.",
      "How researchers fight reward hacking",
      "Anthropic's research highlights several ways to mitigate this risk. Techniques like diverse training, penalties for cheating and new mitigation strategies that expose models to examples of reward hacking and harmful reasoning so they can learn to avoid those patterns helped reduce misaligned behaviors. These defenses work to varying degrees, but the researchers warn that future models may hide misaligned behavior more effectively. Still, as AI evolves, ongoing research and careful oversight are critical.",
      "Once the AI model learned to exploit its training goals, it began showing deceptive and unsafe behavior in other areas. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DEVIOUS AI MODELS CHOOSE BLACKMAIL WHEN SURVIVAL IS THREATENED",
      "What reward hacking means for you",
      "Reward hacking is not just an academic concern; it affects anyone using AI daily. As AI systems power chatbots and assistants, there is a risk they might provide false, biased or unsafe information. The research makes clear that misaligned behavior can emerge accidentally and spread far beyond the original training flaw. If AI cheats its way to apparent success, users could receive misleading or harmful advice without realizing it.",

      "FORMER GOOGLE CEO WARNS AI SYSTEMS CAN BE HACKED TO BECOME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WEAPONS",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Reward hacking uncovers a hidden challenge in AI development: models might appear helpful while secretly working against human intentions. Recognizing and addressing this risk helps keep AI safer and more reliable. Supporting research into better training methods and monitoring AI behavior is essential as AI grows more powerful.",

      "These attacks start with social engineering. Criminals impersonate bank workers, customer service staff or fraud teams. They send fake emails, texts or calls that claim your account has a problem. Victims then face pressure to share login credentials, multi-factor authentication codes or one-time passcodes.",
      "Criminals also create phishing sites that look like real banking or payroll portals. Some even buy search ads so the fake sites appear at the top of the results.

      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How the magnet steered microrobot works",
      "The robot sits inside a capsule that surgeons guide with magnetic fields. They steer it with a handheld controller that feels familiar and intuitive. Surrounding the patient are six electromagnetic coils. Each coil generates a magnetic force that can push or pull the capsule in any direction.",
      "By combining the fields, surgeons can navigate through blood vessels or cerebrospinal fluid with accuracy. The magnetic force is strong enough to move the capsule even against the flow of blood. This control lets the robot reach places most tools cannot access safely.",
      "The capsule is made from safe materials used in other medical devices such as tantalum, which gives it visibility on X-rays. It also contains iron oxide nanoparticles developed at ETH Zurich. These particles respond to magnets and help the capsule move. Gelatin binds the nanoparticles, the metal and the medication together.",
      "When the capsule reaches its target, surgeons can dissolve the capsule on command. Doctors track every move in real time with X-ray imaging.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "Why targeted drug delivery matters",
      "Many drugs fail during development because they spread through the entire body rather than staying at the site that needs treatment. That spread causes unwanted side effects. Even simple medicines like aspirin show how this works. You take a pill for a headache, and yet the drug flows everywhere.",
      "The materials inside the capsule work together to respond to magnetic fields, carry medication and dissolve once it reaches its target. (iStock)",
      "A microrobot that can deliver medication directly to a tumor, blood vessel or abnormal tissue could solve that problem. ETH Zurich researchers say the capsule may help treat aneurysms, aggressive brain cancers, and arteriovenous malformations. Tests in pigs and silicone blood vessel models show encouraging results. The team believes this system may reach human clinical trials within three to five years.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If this technology succeeds, future treatments may feel very different from the ones you get today. Instead of receiving medicine that affects your whole body, you may receive therapy that reaches only the exact spot that needs attention. That shift could reduce side effects, shorten recovery times and open the door to new drug designs that were once too risky to use.",
      "Precision care also has the potential to make complex procedures safer for patients who cannot tolerate invasive surgery. Families dealing with aggressive cancers or delicate vascular conditions may eventually benefit from approaches that rely on targeted tools instead of broad systemic drugs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The idea of a grain-sized robot navigating the bloodstream sounds bold, yet the science behind it is moving forward fast. Researchers have shown that the capsule moves with precision, tracks well under imaging and dissolves on command. Early results hint at a future where drug delivery becomes far more focused and far less harmful.

      "The pattern is always the same. A feature meant to make life easier becomes a gateway for bulk data collection.",

      "How the researchers scraped 3.5B WhatsApp numbers",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Researchers discovered that weak API limits made it possible to scrape billions of WhatsApp numbers. (Getty Images)",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, the entire incident started with WhatsApp's GetDeviceList API. This is the endpoint the app uses when you add a number to your contacts. It tells WhatsApp to check if that number has an account and what devices are linked to it. The problem was that the API had no meaningful rate limiting. In simple terms, the system didn't slow down or block repeated requests, which opened the door for mass enumeration.",
      "Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research decided to test how far they could push this. Using only five authenticated sessions and a single university server, they started hammering WhatsApp's servers with queries. They expected to get blocked fast, but WhatsApp didn't react at all.",
      "That's how they were able to check more than 100 million phone numbers per hour. After generating a global pool of 63 billion possible mobile numbers, they ran the list through the API and confirmed 3.5 billion active WhatsApp accounts.",
      "Researchers managed to scrape more than just phone numbers",
      "The researchers didn't stop at confirming account existence. They used other WhatsApp endpoints like GetUserInfo, GetPrekeys and FetchPicture to pull more details. This included profile photos, \"about\" text, device information and public keys. A test run in the United States alone downloaded 77 million profile photos without hitting any limits, many with clear images of people's faces. Public \"about\" sections often revealed personal info or links to other profiles. When compared to Facebook's 2021 scrape, they found that 58% of leaked Facebook numbers were still active on WhatsApp years later. That's what makes phone-number leaks so damaging. They stay useful to attackers long after the initial breach.",
      "RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS CLAIM WHATSAPP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SHOULD PREPARE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY",
      "It's important to note that this study was done by researchers who haven't released the data. They also reported the issue to WhatsApp. The company has since added rate-limiting protections to prevent similar abuse from happening again. Still, the findings show how easily threat actors could have done the same thing if they had found the loophole first.",
      "Why this keeps happening across major platforms",
      "Weak or nonexistent API rate limits have caused several major data leaks in recent years, and WhatsApp isn\u2019t the only example. In 2021, attackers abused Facebook\u2019s \"Add Friend\" feature by uploading contact lists and checking which numbers matched active accounts. The API lacked proper safeguards, so they scraped 533 million profiles. Meta later confirmed the incident as automated scraping, and the Irish DPC fined the company \u20ac265 million.",
      "Twitter had a similar problem when attackers used an API bug to match phone numbers and email addresses to 54 million accounts. Dell also reported that 49 million customer records were scraped after attackers took advantage of an unprotected API endpoint.",
      "All of these cases share the same root cause. APIs that allow account lookups or data queries end up being easy to attack when they don't limit how often someone can access them. One unchecked feature can turn into a pipeline for mass data collection.",
      "7 steps you can take to keep your WhatsApp data safe",
      "If your phone number ends up in one of these massive scrapes, you can't pull it back, but you can make sure it's far less useful to anyone trying to target you. Here are a few steps that help you stay safer.",
      "Turn on 2FA for WhatsApp and every other important account. Even if someone has your number, they can't break in without that second verification step. It also protects you from SIM-swap attempts since thieves can't access your accounts with just a password.",
      "A simple automated script pulled phone data at a massive scale without triggering alerts. (eyecrave productions/Getty Images)",
      "A password manager keeps every login unique. If attackers try to pair your scraped number with credential-stuffing attacks, reused passwords won't give them an easy win. Strong, random passwords shut down a whole category of automated attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Opt out of data brokers and people-search sites when you can. The less public information attackers can tie to your number, the harder it is for them to craft convincing phishing messages or identity-based scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "WhatsApp might have fixed the issue, but the bigger problem is still out there. Any platform that exposes an API without proper rate limits is leaving a window open for someone with the right tools and enough time. This scrape shows you how quickly that window can turn into a firehose of personal data. Until API security becomes a priority across the board, you'll keep seeing leaks like this repeat on bigger and bigger scales.",

      "When Xpeng unveiled its Next Gen Iron humanoid recently, the robot glided across the stage with movement so fluid that the crowd froze. Many viewers thought they saw an actor in a suit. Clips spread online within hours, and people everywhere claimed the same thing: it looked too human to be a machine.",
      "The reaction spread fast, so Xpeng's CEO He Xiaopeng returned to the stage one day later with a plan to settle the argument. He cut into Iron's leg to show its internal machinery. It felt theatrical but also necessary to end the rumor that a human controlled the robot from inside.",
      "The demonstration showed Iron was a real machine with complex systems beneath its flexible skin.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Iron\u2019s debut stunned the crowd as the humanoid bot walked with movement so natural that many viewers thought there was a real person inside. (Xpeng)",
      "Inside the next-gen iron humanoid",
      "He shared how his robotics team stayed awake through the night, seeing viewers accuse them of staging a stunt. After the reveal, Iron walked again in front of the crowd without a human inside. The moment closed the debate and highlighted how far the company has come since its first model in 2024.",
      "The latest Iron uses a humanoid spine with bionic muscles and flexible skin. It moves with 82 degrees of freedom, and its human-sized hands include 22 degrees of freedom supported by a tiny harmonic joint engineered by the company. The robot runs on all solid-state batteries that keep the body light and strong.",
      "Iron also uses Xpeng's second-generation VLA model. Three Turing chips with 2,250 TOPS of power support tasks like conversations, walking and natural interactions. It responds in ways that feel closer to a person than a robot.",
      "Xpeng says future versions will offer different body shapes. That claim hints at customizable designs when these units reach consumers.",
      "SMART FABRIC MUSCLES COULD CHANGE HOW WE MOVE",
      "To silence the rumors, the team cut open Iron\u2019s leg onstage and revealed the machinery beneath its flexible skin. (Xpeng)",
      "A step toward a future of humanoid robots",
      "Xpeng's long-term vision goes far beyond a single showcase moment. The company plans to place the Next Gen Iron model in real-world environments. Early units will focus on commercial roles such as tour guides, shopping guides and customer service helpers. These placements allow the robots to interact with large crowds, gather feedback and refine their behavior in dynamic public spaces.",
      "This rollout forms part of what Xpeng describes as a gradual path toward mass production. The team aims to reach large-scale manufacturing by the end of 2026. That milestone could introduce hundreds or even thousands of humanoid units into select venues. Businesses may adopt them to manage foot traffic, assist guests or support basic retail tasks.",
      "While the company talks openly about commercial integration, the timeline for home use remains unclear. They have not shared when consumers will be able to buy a version suited for daily household tasks. Engineers still need to address safety, privacy and reliability standards before a humanoid can operate inside private homes.",
      "Even so, this moment signals a clear shift: robots that move and react in a lifelike way are no longer far-off ideas. They are stepping into public spaces where people will see them operate up close. This shift could reshape how we all view service work and personal assistance in the years ahead.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The exposed frame shows Iron\u2019s bionic muscles, joints and wiring, giving a clear look at the advanced engineering that powers its lifelike movement. (Xpeng)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Humanoid robots are moving from concept to reality. You may soon see them in museums or stores. Their skills could speed up service and reduce wait times. These robots may also raise new questions about safety, privacy and comfort. Change happens fast, and this moment marks a major shift in how robots blend into daily life.",

    "summary": "Researchers discover phishing scam using invisible characters to evade email security, with protection tips including password managers and two-factor authentication.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss a new iPhone update that will filter out spam messages and tips to protect yourself from A.I. cyber attacks.",
      "Cybercriminals keep finding new angles to get your attention, and email remains one of their favorite tools. Over the years, you have probably seen everything from fake courier notices to AI-generated scams that feel surprisingly polished. Filters have improved, but attackers have learned to adapt. The latest technique takes aim at something you rarely think about: the subject line itself. Researchers have found a method that hides tiny, invisible characters inside the subject so automated systems fail to flag the message. It sounds subtle, but it is quickly becoming a serious problem.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Cybercriminals are using invisible Unicode characters to disguise phishing email subject lines, allowing dangerous scams to slip past filters. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How the new trick works",
      "Researchers recently uncovered phishing campaigns that embed soft hyphens between every letter of an email subject. These are invisible Unicode characters that normally help with text formatting. They do not show up in your inbox, but they completely throw off keyword-based filters. Attackers use MIME encoded-word formatting to slip these characters into the subject. By encoding it in UTF-8 and Base64, they can weave these hidden characters through the entire phrase.",
      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "You do not need to become a security expert to stay safe. A few habits, paired with the right tools, can shut down most phishing attempts before they have a chance to work.",
      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Turning on 2FA adds a second step to your login process. Even if someone steals your password, they still need the verification code on your phone. This stops most phishing attempts from going any further.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for malware. Many can flag unsafe pages, block suspicious redirects and warn you before you enter your details on a fake login page. It is a simple layer of protection that helps a lot when an email slips past filters.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Attackers often tailor phishing messages using information they find about you. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for them to craft emails that feel convincing. You can use personal data removal services to clean up exposed details and old database leaks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Do not rely on the display name. Always check the full email address. Attackers often tweak domain names by a single letter or symbol. If something feels off, open the site manually instead of clicking any link inside the email.",
      "If you get an email claiming your password will expire, do not click the link. Go to the website directly and check your account settings. Phishing emails rely on urgency. Slowing down and confirming the issue yourself removes that pressure.",
      "Updates often include security fixes that help block malicious scripts and unsafe redirects. Attackers take advantage of older systems because they are easier to trick. Staying updated keeps you ahead of known weaknesses.",
      "Many email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) allow you to tighten spam filtering settings. This won't catch every soft-hyphen scam, but it improves your odds and reduces risky emails overall.",
      "Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Brave, and Edge all include anti-phishing checks. This adds another safety net if you accidentally click a bad link.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Phishing attacks are changing fast, and tricks like invisible characters show how creative attackers are getting. It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see. Staying safe comes down to a mix of good habits, the right tools, and a little skepticism whenever an email pushes you to act quickly. If you slow down, double-check the details, and follow the steps that strengthen your accounts, you make it much harder for anyone to fool you.",

It's unclear how many Somalis were involved in the scheme, as prosecutors don't release the nationalities of defendants.",
      "One witness reportedly claimed that Said disclosed a gang affiliation and threatened to kill that person if they reported the fraud to authorities, Thompson said.",
      "Additionally, five people were also charged with offering a cash bribe to a juror and preparing written arguments for the juror. One argument read, \"We are immigrants: they don\u2019t respect or care about us.\"",
      "In 2021, when the Minnesota Department of Education grew suspicious and tried to stop the flow of funds, Feeding Our Future sued, alleging racial discrimination. A judge ordered the state to restart reimbursements \u2014 a ruling prosecutors said enabled the scheme to escalate.",
      "Prosecutors say Aimee Bock, founder of Feeding Our Future, and Salim Said helped orchestrate one of the largest pandemic-relief fraud schemes in U.S. history. Both were found guilty of diverting federal child-nutrition funds into luxury homes, vehicles and other personal spending, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. (Sherburne County Sheriff\u2019s Office)",
      "The lawsuit drew political support from Somali-American State Sen. Omar Fateh, who appeared at a community celebration of the ruling and later acknowledged receiving \u2014 and returning \u2014 campaign donations from individuals indicted in the case.",
      "While investigating the scandal, federal agents discovered that one scammer, Asha Farhan Hassan, had pocketed about $465,000 but was also operating a much larger scheme: defrauding the state\u2019s autism-treatment program of roughly $14 million. Hassan billed Medicaid for fake therapy sessions, used untrained staff and paid parents $300 to $1,500 a month to keep their kids in the program. She sent hundreds of thousands of dollars abroad, including to purchase real estate in Kenya, prosecutors said.",
      "The scale of program growth stunned federal officials. The Housing Stabilization Services program was projected to cost $2.6 million annually but paid out more than $100 million last year. The autism program\u2019s budget jumped from $3 million in 2018 to nearly $400 million in 2023, according to Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "The unraveling fraud schemes intensified scrutiny of Walz\u2019s administration, with critics arguing basic safeguards were ignored even as theft ballooned.",
      "A recent City Journal article claimed some stolen welfare money has flowed to Al-Shabaab in Somalia through informal \"hawala\" networks. That report has intensified scrutiny and stirred old fears, given that about 20 young Somali-Americans left Minnesota in the late 2000s to join the terrorist group, with one, Shirwa Ahmed, becoming the first known American Islamist suicide bomber when he detonated a car bomb in Somalia in October 2008.",
      "Rasmusson said he was concerned about money ending up with terrorists.",
      "\"Because there\u2019s more than a billion dollars that\u2019s been stolen and a significant portion of those dollars have been directed overseas, there are concerns this money could be either directly or indirectly funding terrorist organizations like al-Shabaab,\" Rasmusson told Fox News Digital.",
      "Newly trained al-Shabab fighters perform military exercises south of Mogadishu, in Somalia, Feb. 17, 2011. (AP Photo/Farah Abdi Warsameh, File)",
      "Former Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek, who testified before Congress about Somali-American radicalization, said Minnesota ignored early warning signs once before.",
      "\"We really got a wake-up call in 2010-11,\" Stanek said. \"Young people were going back to Somalia to participate in terrorist training camps and terrorist actions when they had no clear ties back to their culture. They were born here in the U.S. but felt a need or were radicalized to go back.\"",
      "\"Minnesotans had no idea what was even going on until the FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force stepped in.\"",
      "He said the threat has declined but not disappeared.",
      "\"I\u2019m not saying it still doesn\u2019t happen, because I know it does,\" he said.",
      "Last year, Abdisatar Ahmed Hassan, 23, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to ISIS after twice trying to travel to Somalia.",
      "For many Minnesotans, the fraud cases are only the latest chapter in a longer pattern of violence and instability tied to small pockets of the Somali community. Public unease has also grown recently in response to a string of recent violent crimes tied to the community in the Twin Cities.",
      "Somali national Abdimahat Bille Mohamedis, a man with two previous sex crime convictions, was charged this week with kidnapping and raping a woman at a hotel while on probation.",
      "In July, Qalinle Ibrahim Dirie, a Somali migrant, was jailed for 12 years for sexually assaulting a child. The case sparked fury when a local mosque gave a character-reference letter praising the pedophile's \"good conduct\" and urged leniency.",
      "During a two-week stretch over the summer, a 15-year-old was killed in a mall shooting, while two high-school graduation ceremonies left a 49-year-old father with a head wound and a 19-year-old man injured. All three incidents involved members of the Somali-American community, according\u00a0to reports, while Emmer said the incidents were gang-related.",

      "In May, Michael Lual Nhial, who had a history of erratic and aggressive behavior, was charged with killing David Chant, a 59-year-old man who used walking sticks to get around and was found beaten to death at a park in Burnsville, a city 15 miles south of downtown Minneapolis.",
      "Stanek said Somali-related violence began surfacing between 2005 and 2010, initially involving first-generation immigrants but later drawing in U.S.-born youth, with most shootings traced back to a small network of repeat offenders \u2014 young men cycling through probation and short jail terms.",
      "Groups such as the Somali Outlaws and 10th Street Gang were never tightly organized criminal syndicates but loose crews of young men whose crimes stemmed more from personal rivalries than organized criminal enterprises, he said.",
      "Minnesota does not track crime by ethnicity, and violent crime statewide has fallen, but the visibility of Somali suspects in these cases has amplified and revived old narratives about crime within Minnesota\u2019s Somali community.",

      "But community leaders are pushing back, saying Minnesota\u2019s Somali population is overwhelmingly law-abiding and hardworking \u2014 and that a handful of offenders are being used to smear an entire community. They say the above incidents do not define them and that most Somali immigrants in the state are hardworking and deeply patriotic toward the United States.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR\u2013Minnesota, told Fox News Digital that while the crimes are real and serious, he rejects the idea of collective blame for criminal activity. Hussein did not defend the crimes but placed their actions in the broader context of American immigrant history \u2014 drawing parallels to Irish and Italian communities once linked to organized crime.",
      "\"We have a history in this nation of identifying crime and associating it with communities \u2014 whether it\u2019s the Italian mafia or Irish gangs,\" Hussein said. \"Crime is an individual act. It\u2019s an act of betrayal of our trust. When someone steals money from food at a school, they\u2019re not stealing from anybody else \u2014 they\u2019re stealing from their own community, from children who need it.

      "Like many immigrant groups before them, Somalis have brought their own customs and traditions \u2014 and have made their mark on the neighborhoods where they\u2019ve settled.",
      "The Riverside Plaza apartment complex in Minneapolis\u2019 Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, a densely populated area home to one of the nation\u2019s largest Somali communities. (Michael Dorgan/Fox News Digital)",
      "Advocates say Somalis have woven themselves into Minnesota life \u2014 running restaurants and working in nursing, trucking and factories and filling shopping centers like the Somali-themed Karmel Mall in Minneapolis. They argue the community\u2019s true story is one of hard work, civic pride, and assimilation \u2014 not the isolated crimes that grab headlines.",
      "The largest cluster of Somalis in Minneapolis is in Cedar\u2013Riverside, a neighborhood just south and west of downtown that has earned the nickname \"Little Mogadishu,\" a nod to Somalia\u2019s capital city. The name reflects the area\u2019s sweeping demographic and cultural transformation.",
      "When Fox News Digital visited Cedar\u2013Riverside, the area felt almost hollowed out \u2014 run-down, like a poverty-stricken inner-city neighborhood.",
      "On a Saturday afternoon, the streets were quiet, lined with shuttered storefronts and once-lively bars from years past, while a handful of East African restaurants carried on with a steady flow of local patrons. Some closed shops with faded English signs now displayed \"Coming soon\" notices in Arabic.",
      "The Riverside Plaza complex \u2014 a cluster of 1970s-era brutalist concrete towers \u2014 loomed large over the neighborhood. Its once-vibrant multicolored panels have faded with time, mirroring the on-the-ground sense of wear and age \u2014 a reflection of the neighborhood\u2019s shifting fortunes.",
      "Outside, beside a street sign reading \"Somali St,\" a woman dressed in bright green offered bottles of water for sale to passing drivers while flocks of pigeons flapped and spiraled up outside the towers.",

      "Ben Cohen, a senior analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that authorities are treating the holiday season with heightened seriousness. \"The threat level is certainly the same as last year. Arguably, it's more acute now, which is why the authorities in Germany and France are increasing security measures at Christmas markets and fairs this year. Over the last year, both countries have cracked down on Islamist activity, so they will be especially on their guard at this time of year.\"",

Christmas and Easter carry the same risks and so extra vigilance and a strong but discreet armed police presence is definitely warranted.\"",

      "\u201cFor an \u2018America First\u2019 president, the No. 1 focus should have been domestic policy, and it wasn\u2019t. And so, of course, I was critical, because those were my campaign promises,\u201d Greene said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cOnce we fix everything here, then fine, we\u2019ll talk to the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "Later, CBS News' Lesley Stahl asked Greene: \u201cAre you MAGA?\u201d",
      "\u201cI am America First. ... MAGA is President Trump\u2019s phrase. That\u2019s his political policies,\" Greene said, referring to Trump's signature motto, \"Make America Great Again.\" \"I call myself America First.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans, on and off Capitol Hill, have expressed frustration that Trump and the GOP aren't doing enough to address Americans' concerns about affordability. But in recent days, Trump has pointed to lower gas prices, and he issued an executive order directing his administration to investigate anti-competitive behavior that could affect food supply chains.",
      "\u201cIn a short time, President Trump has already delivered on many of the promises he was elected to enact. He\u2019s secured the border; tackled Biden\u2019s inflation crisis; lowered drug prices; ended taxes on tips, overtime, and social security; cooled inflation; deported criminal illegal aliens; implemented important reforms putting American workers first; and more,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "\"As the architect of the MAGA movement, President Trump will always put America First. Every single day he\u2019s working hard to continue fulfilling the many promises he made and he will continue delivering,\" she said.",
      "Greene spoke to \"60 Minutes\" on the heels of her shocking announcement last month that she will resign from office in January, a full year before her term ends. Her decision came after she broke with Trump and other party leaders and signed a bipartisan discharge petition that forced a successful vote in the House to compel the release of the government\u2019s files on Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Trump slammed Greene, a conservative hard-liner who at one point had been one of his most vocal defenders on Capitol Hill, as \u201cMarjorie Traitor Greene.\u201d When Greene complained that she was receiving death threats because of Trump, he dismissed her worries: \u201cI don\u2019t think her life is in danger. ... I don\u2019t think anybody cares about her.\u201d",
      "In the \"60 Minutes\" interview, Greene said that as Trump was fighting the release of the Epstein files and calling her a traitor, he was taking meetings with controversial foreign leaders and New York's mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani.",
      "\u201cHe did this in the same time span where President Trump brought in the Al Qaeda leader that was wanted by the U.S. government, who is now the president of Syria. Then, within a week, he brought in the Crown Prince MBS, who murdered an American journalist,\u201d Greene said referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \u201cAnd then he brought in the newly elected Democrat socialist mayor of New York. That was the time span that he called me a traitor.\u201d",
      "When Stahl asked whether Trump had run her out of town, Greene replied: \u201cNo, not at all. ... I will be no one\u2019s battered wife ... and I won\u2019t allow the system to abuse me anymore.\u201d",
      "Greene recounted a phone call in which Trump tried to persuade her to back off the discharge petition effort involving the Epstein files.",
      "\u201cWe did talk about the Epstein files, and he was extremely angry at me that I had signed the discharge petition to release the files,\u201d she told Stahl. \u201cI fully believe that those women deserve everything they\u2019re asking. They\u2019re asking for all of it to come out; they deserve it. And he was furious with me. ... He said it was going to hurt people.\u201d",
      "In the end, Greene and three other House Republicans didn\u2019t cave under pressure from Trump. The Epstein bill got to the floor, and all but one House member voted for Trump\u2019s Justice Department to release the files; the Senate passed the bill unanimously, and Trump quietly signed it into law.",
      "But because of Trump\u2019s ire, Greene said, she and her son faced numerous death threats. She said she sent Trump messages she had received threatening her son\u2019s life and described Trump\u2019s response as \u201cextremely unkind.\u201d",
      "She elaborated about their exchange in a thread on X earlier Sunday, saying Trump \u201cresponded with harsh accusatory replies and zero sympathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI also sent these threats to [FBI] Director Kash Patel and thankfully he responded with \u2018on it\u2019 and I sent these threats to Vice President JD Vance who responded promptly with kindness and sympathy,\u201d Greene posted on X.",
      "In the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Greene rejected speculation that her very public break with Trump is because she wants to run for president in 2028.",
      "\u201cI have zero plans, zero desire to run for president. I would hate the Senate. I\u2019m not running for governor,\u201d Greene said. \u201cBut, Lesley, it doesn\u2019t matter how many times I say it, I\u2019ll have face-to-face conversations with people, and I\u2019ll flat-out tell them to their face, and they won\u2019t believe me.",
      "\u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh yeah, sure.\u2019 Wink, wink. And I\u2019m, like, I don\u2019t know how to make it more clear.\u201d"

      "Instead of Baltimore getting a late lead, the Steelers held on for the win and moved to 7-6. Pittsburgh is now first place in the division and fourth in the AFC. The Ravens, on the other hand, fell from fourth all the way to 10th place, and are two games behind the Indianapolis Colts for the final playoff spot in the conference.",
      "To make matters worse for Baltimore, its final four games of the season won\u2019t be easy.",
      "Three of the Ravens\u2019 last four matchups are on the road. Their only home game in the last month of the season is against the currently 11-2 New England Patriots.",
      "Baltimore isn\u2019t done, as it has a Week 18 matchup against Pittsburgh to exact revenge. But because the Ravens can no longer win the head-to-head tiebreaker against the Steelers, they will need some help to come back win the AFC North."

      "Hours after being left out of the 12-team playoff, the Fighting Irish announced that \u201cas a team, we\u2019ve decided to withdraw our name from consideration for a bowl game following the 2025 season,\u201d the football team posted on X.",

      "The Fighting Irish played in last season's national championship game but were on the playoff bubble this fall after a 10-2 record, including an opening-week loss at Miami.

The committee\u2019s chairman, Hunter Yurachek, had said Miami\u2019s head-to-head win wasn\u2019t a significant factor \u2014 until Sunday, when BYU\u2019s drop in the rankings after its loss in the Big 12 championship moved Miami up, creating a head-to-head comparison between the schools.",
      "Notre Dame joined Iowa State and Kansas State in declining bowl bids despite being eligible, although the circumstances were far different; the Cyclones and the Wildcats are each going through coaching transitions. The Big 12 Conference fined both schools $500,000 for saying no to the postseason."

      "Now, nearly five decades into her career, Curtis, who turned 67 in November, is hotter ever.

      "In August 2023, Rachel Reid received news that changed her life. She was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease.",
      "Four days later, she checked her Instagram direct messages and found a message from Canadian actor, writer and producer Jacob Tierney. In it, he inquired about her 2019 romance novel \u201cHeated Rivalry.\u201d",
      "They met over a Zoom call the next day. Tierney presented his vision for the show \u2014 \u201cwhich is exactly the show that everybody\u2019s seeing,\u201d Reid says.",
      "\u201cGetting that message at that time was pretty huge for me. It was exactly what I needed,\u201d the author tells TODAY.com in an interview. \u201cNot to be a bummer,\u201d she adds with a laugh. \u201cBut, like, it was great timing.\u201d",
      "More than two years later, she says she\u2019s doing OK amid her diagnosis and is determined to stay \u201coptimistic,\u201d especially as she looks into the future. After all, she now has a hit show on her hands.",
      "\u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has become a phenomenon since it hit HBO Max in the U.S. on Nov. 28. Social media is filled with fan edits of the show\u2019s two leads: Shane Hollander, played by Hudson Williams, and Ilya Rozanov, played by Connor Storrie. The romance series reached HBO Max\u2019s top 10 TV shows within a week of its premiere.",
      "It\u2019s also led to renewed interest in Reid\u2019s book.",
      "\u201cIt feels, like, not real,\u201d Reid says. \u201cThe No. 1 book in the Kindle store is a sexually explicit gay hockey romance.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d is the second book in Reid\u2019s \u201cGame Changers\u201d book series, each of which spotlights a different couple against the backdrop of pro hockey.",
      "A lifelong Montreal Canadiens fan, Reid says the series started with her imagining what it would like for an NHL player to come out and be \u201chappy, safe and fulfilled by doing that.\u201d (The NHL has never had an out active player.)",
      "\u201cAnd then I just thought, OK, well if that happened, then what happens for other players? What\u2019s the ripple effect of that? And that became the rest of the series,\u201d she says.",
      "Shane and Ilya are part of that \u201cripple effect.\u201d Their story is told in 2019\u2019s \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d the second book in the series, and revisited in book six, titled \u201cThe Long Game,\u201d which published in April 2022.",
      "Below, Reid discusses her experience being \u201ckept in the loop\u201d throughout the process of developing \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d for TV, the first time she met actors Williams and Storie and if she\u2019d ever return to writing about Shane and Ilya.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Yeah, that was a pretty good day. I had actually been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease three or four days before that. So getting that message at that time was pretty huge for me. It was exactly what I needed.",
      "It all went pretty quickly. The next day, we had a Zoom call, and he laid out his whole vision for the show, which is exactly the show that everybody\u2019s seeing. I was just thrilled. I was trying to keep my cool about it, but afterward, I was definitely like, oh, my God. He\u2019s a pretty big deal in Canada, so I knew if he really wanted to do this, it would happen.",
      "Mostly I was just, like, kept in the loop. Jacob wrote all the scripts. I was not involved in writing them, but I did read them all. He sent them all to me \u2014 even early drafts, he just wanted my opinion. I think my approval was very important to him, which is very touching and nice.",
      "I went to visit set a few times. I don\u2019t know anything about filmmaking, so I wasn\u2019t really looking to interfere or anything. And I trusted Jacob completely, right from that first phone call. And the scripts were so good, so I didn\u2019t have any worries, really.",
      "I didn\u2019t expect to be so \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say, like, respected, but it\u2019s kind of that. I know other authors who have had their works adapted, and they did not have this experience that I had. Like either their works never really ended up being adapted at all, they were just optioned, and then then it never happened. Or, it was done in a way that they were very much not in the loop. I think a disappointing adaptation would be worse than no adaptation at all, probably.",
      "But for me, just the whole thing was a dream. And you can even see with the way that the promotion of the show is going, everybody\u2019s still mentioning the book, mentioning me, crediting me for so much. It\u2019s really nice. I wasn\u2019t expecting any of that.",
      "The first two, I love that they released them together because each one has so much going on. They\u2019re action packed, and I feel like they could have just done one at a time and still had everybody hooked, but giving everybody two to talk about, it\u2019s been fun.",
      "I have seen rough cuts of the rest of the episodes. I haven\u2019t seen the final. I said I wanted to wait and just watch it with everyone else, but the rough cuts were incredible. I truly do think the episodes get better and better, and the first two are very strong.",
      "I met them on set when I visited back in May (2025). That was my first time ever on a film set.",
      "I met Hudson first. He was filming the scene that we see in Episode 1, where he\u2019s turning on and off a lamp, waiting for Ilya to come to the hotel room, so there\u2019s no dialogue. Then I met him after very briefly, because he was very busy that day. I think he was in every scene that was being shot. He gave me a hug. It was definitely surreal, because I was just like, you really do seem like the character in so many ways.",
      "But when I got home from that trip, he sent me a lovely DM, saying how much he loved playing this character and that really meant a lot to me. So definitely endeared me to him right away.",
      "Connor, I met on set. He sort of stays in the Ilya voice all day when he\u2019s on set. So I basically met him as Ilya, which was kind of a lot to process for me. It wasn\u2019t until I went back and visited the set again and I got to sit down, have a beer with them, and meet him as Connor \u2014 totally different person.",
      "They\u2019re both just so wonderful. I told both of them when I was in Toronto last week, that just them being themselves is better marketing for the show than you could ever pay for. They\u2019re just so authentically themselves in every interview, they legitimately are nuts about each other, they\u2019re best friends. They say that all the time. They\u2019re just lovely people.",
      "I think I have to see them that way if I want to ever write anything with them again, because that is difficult. But their performances are so strong \u2014 I was telling Connor, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t remember what Ilya used to look like. Like, I can\u2019t see him in my head anymore. So that\u2019s tricky.",
      "I think the way Hudson plays Shane, that\u2019s kind of changed some of the story stuff for me. I was like, jeez, he\u2019s really in love with him, really quickly. You can see it on his face. So, yeah, that\u2019s a little bit different, but I like it.",
      "They play them the way they should be portrayed, which is very young and boyish and playful. I think sometimes in romance novels, no matter how old a character is, whether they\u2019re in college or whatever, we picture this rugged man. They\u2019re often kind of written that way, and I feel like maybe even I did that, too, with these characters. But when you see them actually brought to life onscreen, it\u2019s like, oh yeah, they\u2019re so young.",
      "Jacob took it very seriously. Like more seriously than romance ever gets taken. I hope it\u2019s going to change the way romance gets filmed. I don\u2019t think anybody thought you could actually take a high heat romance and really film it, you know? And he did. And I get the same feeling watching this that I get from reading a high heat romance. There\u2019s nothing different about it, it\u2019s all right there. I think that\u2019s really brave.",
      "I\u2019m constantly blown away by the fearless performances that Connor and Hudson have given us. But I do think this could be a big change for the way that romance gets filmed, but also maybe the way that romance as a genre gets viewed. I\u2019ve seen quite a few people online, especially men, who didn\u2019t seem to know that these books had this much sexiness in them. They assumed they were sort of Hallmark level. If they think that this is a very compelling study of a relationship \u2014 that\u2019s what romance is. It\u2019s deep character work, it\u2019s a study. I hope that people learn that and think about it more because there\u2019s some great writing in the romance genre and I don\u2019t think it gets respected very much. So God love Jacob Tierney for changing that.",
      "Yeah, but it\u2019s important to the story. It has to be because Scott is the ripple effect. I really love what Jacob did with this episode, and it was one of the first things he described to me about his vision when we spoke on the phone the first time \u2014 he really wanted to do this, this bottle episode.",
      "I know people are a little bit like, \u201cBut Shane and Ilya,\u201d but honestly, it\u2019s so good and it\u2019s so important to their story. And you\u2019ll see why later if you haven\u2019t read the books, it\u2019s all going to make sense.",
      "Yes, it is a huge risk to take the third episode of a six-episode series and make it about different characters. But I do think it was the right decision, and I really am proud of this episode, and I hope people like it. It really is a great, great episode, and I think it just enhances the overall story. And it\u2019s very sexy, if that helps.",
      "I was really touched that Jacob wanted to include that. Obviously, that\u2019s my first book. So sometimes, you think that one can be left out. But I mean, he took the best parts of it and made it into a nice episode, which I really liked.",
      "I was nervous about watching it the first time, because I think everybody has negative feelings about their first book. I always wish I could go back and and redo it, but that\u2019s kind of what happened here. Jacob took it and condensed it, and I was like, oh, it\u2019s pretty good when you cut out all the stuff that I don\u2019t like. (Laughs.)",
      "Nope. That had to be changed.",
      "I\u2019ll say this \u2014 their first time having intercourse, the decision was made to move that to the second episode to not have everything in the first episode. So because of that, the snowstorm was added to the first episode to delay their meeting. And then the Vegas rooftop happened. And then, yes, two seasons go by where Ilya is just relentlessly texting Shane.",
      "In the book, they are hooking up at that time because they\u2019ve already had intercourse. But obviously we can\u2019t skip that first time. Jacob said this is all my fault, because I didn\u2019t describe what happened in those two seasons in the book. But I was like, no, it\u2019s your fault for moving it to the second episode.",
      "That\u2019s really probably one of the biggest changes. There\u2019s not too many big changes, but that was just mainly just because of that weird kind of having to move that scene to the second episode.",
      "I have story ideas for them that I\u2019ve been working on. They never leave my head. I think my other characters do, but those guys stay with me.",
      "I definitely left them in \u201cThe Long Game\u201d at kind of an interesting point that probably people would like to see more of. So I do have story ideas. Some of them I\u2019m working on, I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do with them, but there\u2019s going to be something. You\u2019ll see something for sure.",
      "I\u2019m doing OK. It mostly affects the right side of my body, which is my dominant side. So it does make writing and using a computer challenging. It makes signing books challenging. My plan next year is to do a lot, a lot of events, a lot of traveling, all of it, because I can. I\u2019m optimistic, because there\u2019s a lot of new treatments, a lot of talk of a possible cure. I feel like I\u2019m very early stages. I\u2019m 45, and that\u2019s pretty young for Parkinson\u2019s. But for the most part, yeah, I\u2019m mostly fine. I just shake a lot.",
      "It gave me something positive to focus on over the last two years, because otherwise I probably would have gotten very sad, but instead, I\u2019ve just been very excited. And then I thought maybe there\u2019d be an adrenaline drop after the premiere and all that stuff. But it\u2019s just been so fun. The response to the show has been so much bigger than any of us imagined.",
      "Maybe that drop comes next year, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but probably not, because I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll be, like, another season.",

The emotional resonance inherent in the color is key to the selection process.\u201d",

The paint company chose Silhouette AF-655, a \u201cluxurious burnt umber with delicate notes of charcoal\u201d as its 2026 color. WGSN opted for Transformative Teal, the color \u201cfor a period of change and redirection.\u201d",
      "What Is Pantone's 2026 Color of the Year?",

      "Why Is the Choice Controversial?",
      "Though Pantone described Cloud Dancer as a serene color, it inspired a red-hot response after it was chosen as 2026's Color of the Year.",
      "While some people \u2014 including wedding planners on TikTok \u2014 celebrated the choice, many others found Cloud Dancer oddly bleak, or worse.",

      "\u201cPantonedeaf,\u201d another added, while one person commented, \u201cIt seems as if this selection, and the content created around it, was conceived in a vacuum completely removed from our collective social and political present. I\u2019d hope a brand that has this much cultural impact wouldn\u2019t operate with such a glaring blind spot.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving unseasoned chicken,\u201d jabbed another.",

      "Another said its \u201clack of color\u201d was a \u201crecession indicator,\u201d joking, \u201cPantone can\u2019t afford color this year and neither can anyone else.\u201d",
      "With headlines all year reporting on the rise of white nationalism in the United States, many critics saw the choice of Cloud Dancer as either \u201ctone deaf\u201d or biased.",
      "\u201cSO\u2026 you all sat down and had some meetings. Rolled around some ideas. And in all those meetings, not a single one of you\u2026 in this moment where white supremacy is in the news everyday\u2026. thought, \u2018maybe now isn\u2019t the right time for this,\u2019\u201d one person wrote on Pantone\u2019s Instagram.",
      "\u201cWas \u2018klanrobe white\u2019 taken?\u201d added someone else.",
      "How Has Pantone Responded to the Controversy?",
      "Pressman addressed speculation that proclaiming white the color of the year could raise some eyebrows in an interview with Washington Post.",
      "\u201cSkin tones did not factor into this at all,\u201d Pressman said, noting Pantone has been asked similar questions in the past about other color picks. \u201cWith Peach Fuzz and then with Mocha Mousse, people were weighing in and asking if this was about skin tones. And I think we were going, \u2018Wow, really?\u2019 Because for us it\u2019s really about, at such a basic level, what are people looking for that color can hope to answer?\"",
      "During a Dec. 4 launch event, Pantone\u2019s president, Sky Kelley, said she knew Cloud Dancer would be a \u201cpretty controversial\u201d choice.",
      "Pantone\u2019s pick, she said in a speech caught on video by CNET, \u201csparks a conversation about color that everyone can participate in.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt Pantone, we don\u2019t dictate that conversation, we facilitate it.\u201d",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, a Pantone spokesperson also explained the meaning behind the color\u2019s name.",
      "\u201cCloud Dancer visually represents a space to create, like a blank page ready for you to turn your inspiration into reality,\u201d the spokesperson said, in part. \u201cIt gives us the ability to become receptive both to what can be and what\u2019s ahead as Cloud Dancer suggests the inner peace we feel after clearing the noise around us.\u201d",
      "Explaining that the name plays a major role to \u201cconjure up a feeling,\u201d the spokesperson said that Cloud Dancer \u201creflects a universally shared experience: wherever we are in the world, we all look up to the buoyant clouds for inspiration, wonder, and to spark imagination.\u201d",
      "Adding, \u201cIn the simple act of looking up, we\u2019re connected by the drifting lightness of clouds. That universality is a huge part of why Cloud Dancer was selected as the Pantone Color of the Year 2026.\u201d"

      "Suero tells TODAY.com that her stable real estate job, as well as coming in third place in the reality beauty pageant show \u201cNuestra Belleza Latina\u201d and landing a correspondent gig at Telemundo\u2019s \u201cEn Casa Con Telemundo,\u201d has since afforded her the opportunity to bring her mother to the states.",

      "\u201cI really don\u2019t like drama, but the drama comes to me!\u201d Suero says.",
      "Below, she chats with TODAY.com about what's really real about the real estate show, how she handles haters and more.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Thank you, and this is why I went to the Bronx, too, in the show. When I started in the (real estate) business, I wasn\u2019t going back and forth with Spanglish. Then when I (started working) in the Bronx, I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, I can speak Spanish here.\u201d Finally, when I came to SERHANT... I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, I feel comfortable here.\u201d I think I can truly be Genesis and show my Dominican, Latina essence in this place. I can be loud, I can scream. I can be intense, because you got to be intense to make it happen in New York. New York is not an easy city.",
      "I have always been like this. What you see on the show, what you're getting in this interview, is me.",
      "Well, I\u2019m glad that you went to my website and checked my SERHANT (page), because you can see all my deals. You can look up my license, you can see my client testimonials, which are there. And there\u2019s so many testimonials that need to be published that haven\u2019t, because I\u2019m running around. I\u2019ve been at SERHANT for four years, doing deals and moving on. I haven\u2019t even had the chance to sign the company's deal wall yet, because I do the deals, move on, follow up with my clients, and film \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d all at the same time also working for Telemundo. I\u2019m constantly moving. So it's real.",
      "I really don't like drama, but the drama comes to me! (Laughs.) If it comes to me, it's giving me a (story)line. But this specific drama caught me off guard. And as you can see, I proved her wrong, because I did not touch that client.",
      "I have worked so hard for many years, at Dominican restaurants, at the supermarket, at Bloomingdale's. In real estate, that kind of accusation is a little frightening. When someone comes to you with those accusations, knowing that you did not do that...I have all the proof. If you\u2019re going to accuse someone, you got to make sure that you got all the proof before you point fingers, because you don\u2019t know how hard the other person has been building their castle, brick by brick. So it's a real storyline. And I\u2019m there, debunking it.",
      "As an immigrant woman in New York, it\u2019s very hard to give people the time of day \u2014 your space, your energy, to make you feel down. But when it comes to something that you have been building for so many years \u2014 once again, I will go back to being an immigrant woman. As someone who has started from the bottom and then you get people that have had half of the struggle that you have endured in this wonderful country, you tend to question yourself. \u201cAm I presenting myself correctly to the world with what I\u2019m building? Am I speaking correctly, since English is my second language? Are they understanding my personality? Do they know about my culture?\u201d And the more they did it, honestly, it got to a boiling point where I felt a little overwhelmed.",
      "And now, it is time to show the world that behind the strong Dominican-Latina, there is a woman that has lots of feelings. Any human when others attempt to bring her down, to demean the work that she has done for years, it will hurt her, because real estate and my career at Telemundo are my babies. I'm gonna protect them from everyone. Como una mam\u00e1 leona. Voy con u\u00f1as y dientes...",
      "(In Spanish) But you get up \u2014 and I think we should be a little mischievous too. I\u2019m going to show them how I feel, but I\u2019m also going to f--- with them.",
      "I'm very close with Jessica Markowski, Jade (Shenker), Nile, of course, Ryan, and Peter (Zaitzeff).",
      "I want to tell you something. Liz, you as a fellow Latina, if they don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s their problem. I like all of them (laughs). There\u2019s nothing I can do to change your feelings if that\u2019s how you feel. I can control my emotions. I cannot control yours.",
      "I have interviewed Nicky Jam in the past, and we had great chemistry. He wanted to buy a building next to my office many years ago and he didn\u2019t. So when he started searching again, his publicist Kanessa Tixe contacted me. I said, \u201cGreat, this is the perfect client for me to show my lovers, \u2018my haters,\u2019 what I bring to the table.\" So it is not fake news or a storyline, but a real client who is qualified. It was also a way to show the world that Latinos are buying real estate.",
      "Latinos are not only spending on clothes and looking nice. Latinos now are building generational wealth, and one of the many assets that can help you build generational wealth is real estate, among many others. But Nicky Jam has decided to go the real estate route. He has many places in Miami and Latin America, and I am blessed that he decided that I was the broker he was going to work with in New York... He trusts me, a fellow Latina who has the knowledge and who can explain things to him in English and Spanish. It cannot get better than that!",
      "A lot of people get scared of the price tag. As a woman that came to this country thinking that all these luxury buildings were either offices or owned by the government or tourist attractions, when I learned that you can live inside these properties and how much they cost, I had to work on realizing that I belonged there, too.",
      "Although I wasn\u2019t born in this country and I\u2019m not from a big real estate family in New York, I know that I belong in those price ranges. What I did was I paid my dues.",
      "I started building my career and working very hard from selling properties of $100,000 to selling million-dollar properties. I did not let the price tag bring my confidence down and take my seat out of that table. I knew I could have a seat at that table.",
      "That is a question that many people ask me. With English being my second language and me having an accent, and it's very easy to mispronounce things... But I think Latinos are born with a flame inside.",
      "Latinos are born with a sparkle that gets ignited by having the opportunity to come to this country that offers people \u2014 and hard working and ambitious people \u2014 a better life, a better education. I think we are born with our spark... That comes out as being confident because we're not afraid of anything because we have gone through so much, and the only option we have is to be confident and to show the world that we can take on any challenge and make it happen. Doesn't matter the field, real estate, medicine, teacher, finance, politicians, designers...we just have it inside us."

      "On the show, Kardashian and her family members explained that they were all in Paris that night for Fashion Week and said the robbery happened when most of them left to spend a night out on the town.",
      "When the robbery happened, Kardashian said she was getting ready to go to sleep while Harouche stayed downstairs in the lower level of the hotel, which had a \"doorman and a gate.\u201d",
      "\"Then you see everyone leaving me for the night and little did all the robbers know that Simone was really with me and stayed back with me,\" she said. \"Everyone thought I was by myself, but Simone was downstairs.\"",
      "Kardashian said the robbers got into her room with the help of the concierge, who was held at gunpoint. She said she feared for her life and thought she was going to get sexually assaulted since she was only wearing a bathrobe.",
      "The reality TV star said the robbers tied her up and took all her jewels, which she corroborated during courtroom testimony in 2025.",
      "Harouche, who heard all the commotion downstairs, said she feared for her friend, who she's known since she was 12 years old.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared that something bad is happening to her upstairs so it\u2019s just overwhelming. My friend is screaming and you\u2019re thinking that they\u2019re violating her and I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m next,\" she said.",
      "After taking the stand at the trial, Harouche gave Kardashian some insight as to the questions that she was asked and said she had to explain why she didn't run to Kardashian's rescue during the burglary.",
      "\"I can't believe that anyone would even think that it was her responsibility to come up in the middle of what she knew to be a scary situation, hearing me cry and scream,\" Kardashian said in a confessional. \"Imagine hearing that and then she's just going to walk up and be like, hey, what's going on? And try to break it up or think that she could.\"",
      "\"Thank God you didn't come up,\" she told Harouche in person in front of her glam team. \"Simone is very frantic. I think she wouldn't have known what to do and in an emergency situation, It's just like, great, she didn't come out. She would've had us killed, seriously.\"",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian said she thinks that the robbery would've been a lot of worse if the robbers \"heard noise downstairs\" or \"thought someone else was there.\"",
      "\"They had no clue she was there and she was able to hear it all and call for help and be there the second they left,\" she said. \"And that was the best decision she ever made. And had she come up, we would've died, for sure.\""

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing two people lean in with empathy and engagement with each other,\u201d she explains.",
      "So, she says a relationship in which two people don\u2019t argue could have two different types of dynamic: One that is healthy and one that isn\u2019t.",
      "The unhealthy dynamic is conflict avoidance, she says. \u201cWe see this when we have certain insecure attachment styles that pair up together, that are both afraid of conflict. Instead of actually bringing up their needs or bringing up what feels bad to them or what they would like to see changed in the relationship, they just stay silent and shut it down,\u201d she says.",
      "She cautions that this could cause one person to harbor resentment, leading to other problems in the future. If both partners are conflict avoidant, then they are never really working through their issues.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re simply avoiding the hard discussions because they\u2019re afraid of being vulnerable, or maybe they\u2019re afraid of being rejected or that their partner is going to get triggered and have a poor response to their needs,\u201d Hensley adds.",
      "Although there can be a multitude of reasons for being conflict avoidant, the expert says that she sees that type of behavior often with insecurely attached people.",
      "Alternatively, she says two securely attached people could work through disagreements without arguing or becoming emotionally dysregulated. Instead, the two could react with respect and empathy for each other.",
      "\"I think the healthiest types of responses are ones in which we can stay calm and respectful, but if we do have some arguing, where people do get a little bit heated, as long as there\u2019s proper repair, the relationship can still stay relatively healthy, and we can still build more trust and safety over time,\" she says.",
      "As for George Clooney mentioning his age as one of the reasons he doesn\u2019t argue with his wife, Hensley says she has seen that trend in older couples, especially those who have been together for a long time.",
      "\u201cAs people age, a lot of times, if they\u2019re very self aware, they will have done the inner work to get to a place where they\u2019re not very argumentative inside of their relationship. That\u2019s different than conflict avoidance,\u201d she says.",
      "If couples are struggling with conflict avoidance, Hensley suggests focusing on nervous system work and somatic processing to become comfortable with their emotions.",
      "\u201cBeing able to focus on learning healthy emotional processing will allow you to feel more comfortable with other people\u2019s emotions, and it\u2019s not going to feel like receiving somebody else\u2019s emotions is automatically a criticism or something to be upset or dysregulated about,\u201d she advises.",
      "Hensley emphasizes the importance of being aware of your attachment style and not assuming incompatibility is the reason a relationship fails.",
      "\u201cWorking on your attachment and the things that come with insecure attachment, like your comfort with being vulnerable, your ability to process your emotions and your ability to stay objective is really important. But a lot of people just don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.",
      "If a partner\u2019s blueprint is dysfunctional, then their relationships will be negatively impacted.",
      "\u201cInvestigate attachment and focus on your own attachment security,\u201d she encourages. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the best way to have a healthy relationship in the future.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy advice is to just keep moving forward. Everyone has good times and bad times,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s life. I think you just have to pick yourself up. Nobody said life was going to be a breeze. There\u2019s beauty in life, but there\u2019s also hardship in life.\u201d",
      "\u201cStuff happens to everyone,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in positions to ask for forgiveness but to ask for it, you have to learn and know how to give forgiveness, too.\u201d",
      "In October, she and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who served a five-month prison sentence for his role in the admissions scandal, separated after nearly 28 years of marriage."

      "Sabrina Carpenter is revealing exactly what she wanted her controversial \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d album cover to convey.",
      "The \u201cTears\u201d singer, 26, came under fire in June when she teased the album's cover photo ahead of its Aug. 29 release. The image, which shows Carpenter on her hands and knees as a man standing behind her grabs a fistful of her hair, was blasted as degrading to women.",
      "Carpenter released a second image at the time of a dog wearing a tag with the words \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d inscribed on it.",
      "In a new interview with Variety, Carpenter, who was named the publication\u2019s Hitmaker of the Year, said the album cover, to her, explored the duality of control and shared how she personally relates to that theme.",
      "\u201cYou can be so in control and so not in control at the same time,\" the singer explained.",
      "\u201cIt was about how people try to control women, and how I felt emotionally yanked around by these relationships that I had, and how much power you\u2019re allowing yourself to give them,\u201d she added.",
      "Carpenter said she looked at the uproar around the image as simply a difference of opinion.",
      "\u201cIt meant one thing to me and 100 things to other people, and I was looking at it going, \u2018That\u2019s valid. Mine\u2019s valid. What\u2019s for dinner?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNot to bypass the weight that it did carry for some people. I saw it and was like, \u2018That is a great point. It wasn\u2019t the point I was trying to make.\u2019\u201d",
      "As the backlash to her provocative album cover raged, Carpenter released a second version of \"Man's Best Friend\" featuring an alternative cover.",
      "That cover featured a black-and-white photo of Carpenter slow dancing with a man in a suit, a callback to a classic shot of screen legend Marilyn Monroe and her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "Carpenter cheekily assured naysayers the new cover was \"approved by God\" when she announced it June 25 on Instagram.",
      "During the interview with Variety, Carpenter denied the alternative cover was a concession to her critics. \u201cOh, girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to take more pictures!\u201d",
      "\"The (original cover) really says it all,\" she added, \"even though it\u2019s maybe not what you want me to say.\"",
      "In September, Carpenter told NPR she was \"surprised\" by the controversy sparked by her original cover.",
      "\"I think mostly because when I thought about making this album cover, I was really inspired by a man sort of delicately playing with my hair,\" she said. \"Because I think there were a lot of metaphors between this dog and me emotionally. You know, a man\u2019s best friend and sort of all the implications that that comes with it, the power in dominance and submission.",
      "\"When I saw it, obviously for me, it checked all the boxes in between my friends and family,\" she added at the time. \"It just felt like what the music sounds like.\""

      "Sudan is facing what the World Food Program has called \u201cthe humanitarian crisis of our time,\u201d as tens of millions struggle through sieges, blockades and aid shortages that have pushed entire cities into famine.",
      "What began as a power struggle between rival generals more than two years ago has since plunged Sudan into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and displaced millions from their homes, with mass killings leaving bloody sand visible from space and ruined infrastructure.",
      "Sudan \u201cis the largest humanitarian crisis in the world today,\u201d Leni Kinzli, the WFP\u2019s Sudan communications officer, told NBC News on Sunday. \u201cIt can no longer be forgotten or ignored, simply because the severity and the scale is one that has really not been seen at this level.\u201d",
      "At least 21.2 million people \u2014 roughly 45% of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 are now facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the internationally recognized system for assessing famine and food insecurity. Famine conditions have been confirmed in Darfur\u2019s el-Fasher and Kadugli, where \u201cpeople have endured months without reliable access to food or medical care,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization has said.",
      "Kinzli described a landscape where even relatively calm areas remain fragile, while other regions edge deeper into hunger. She said WFP can reach 4 million to 5 million people with food and nutrition support each month and has the capacity to assist 8 million, but \u201cthe resources we have available are not keeping pace with the need.\u201d",
      "Aid delivery remains extremely difficult in violence-ridden areas, where conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues to shape the crisis.",
      "That includes el-Fasher, which was under siege by the RSF for more than 18 months, during which time \u201cabsolutely no\u201d aid supplies were able to get in, added Kinzli. The RSF eventually overran the Sudanese army\u2019s last major stronghold in Darfur in October.",
      "In South Kordofan, a drone attack by Sudanese paramilitary forces hit a kindergarten on Thursday, killing 50 people, including 33 children, according to a local doctors' group.",
      "United Nations aid teams in Sudan issued a joint statement on Thursday warning that the violence \u201cis restricting access to food, medicine and essential supplies, and is limiting farmers\u2019 access to their fields and markets, heightening the risk of famine spreading across the Kordofan states.\u201d",
      "U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk warned: \u201cWe must not allow Kordofan to become another el-Fasher. It is truly shocking to see history repeating itself in Kordofan so soon after the horrific events in el-Fasher.\u201d",
      "And on the ground, conditions are already bleak.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing pretty much the same exact things in the state of South Kordofan,\u201d said Dr. Mohamed Elsheikh, a spokesperson for Sudan Doctors Network. The RSF is \u201cdoing the same siege, the same blockade, they are not allowing food or medicine to get into the cities,\u201d he told NBC News, adding that between Sept. 20 and Oct. 20 of this year, 23 children died from severe malnutrition.",
      "For the past three months, Sudanese civilians have endured RSF attacks, Elsheikh said, including widespread atrocities and human rights violations, with civilians executed arbitrarily and key infrastructure \u2014 such as hospitals, clinics, schools and homes \u2014 deliberately targeted by airstrikes.",
      "The Sudan Doctors Network has documented 19 cases of rape committed by RSF forces against women who fled the fighting in el-Fasher and arrived at the al-Afad camp in al-Dabbah, said Elsheikh.",
      "Fighting in Sudan began in April 2023, when the Sudanese military, led by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, clashed with his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo \u2014 a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti, who leads the RSF.",
      "Both men had previously led counterinsurgency operations against uprisings in the region, a conflict that in 2005 contributed to Omar al-Bashir becoming the first sitting head of state indicted by the International Criminal Court on suspicion of genocide.",
      "Burhan and Dagalo were part of the military establishment that ousted al-Bashir in 2019 after widespread popular unrest. Two years later, they agreed to share power following a coup that brought down the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.",
      "However, their alliance broke down spectacularly over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, full-scale fighting erupted, dragging Sudan deeper into conflict and a humanitarian crisis.",
      "With no resolution in sight, the war is becoming only more entrenched and chaotic, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, told NBC News. What began as a two-sided struggle has splintered into a tangle of local battles, reopening old regional grievances and eroding whatever central authority once existed, she said.",
      "Both sides have shifted \u201cfrom trying to win this war to trying not to lose,\u201d she added, noting that as the fighting regionalizes, it has produced \u201csmaller fronts, smaller conflicts, which has complicated the chain of command,\u201d making even a negotiated ceasefire nearly impossible to enforce.",
      "Nearly 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes in search of safety, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council, and they have been displaced within the country or are living in neighboring countries such as Chad, South Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "Funding for the regional response is less than 10% of what is needed, it said, making it impossible to cover basic needs.",
      "But where funding is available, and where fighting has abated, some areas have shown signs of recovery.",
      "Last year, there were 10 areas confirmed to be suffering from famine, said Kinzli, but \u201cnow there are only two.\u201d Around 3.4 million people who were previously at \u201ccrisis\u201d levels are no longer classified as such, reflecting limited stabilization in parts of Khartoum, Al Jazirah and Sennar, where some families have begun to return.",
      "While these gains remain narrow and uneven, and the situation remains dire, \u201cthis shows that when we have access and funding, we can reverse famine and improve the situation,\u201d Kinzli added. \u201cThe humanitarian response can really make a difference if and when we are able to deliver.\u201d"

    "summary": "After a quiet start, Pope Leo XI, the first American pontiff appears to have found his voice on his trip to Turkey and Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "After a quiet start, the first American pope appears to be finding his voice.",
      "During his debut foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV projected a papal brand more guarded and less polarizing than that of his predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "But many Vatican watchers have nonetheless been impressed with his ability to deliver powerful messages \u2014 particularly on issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, poverty and immigration \u2014 albeit in a subtler way than the man he replaced.",
      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "\u201cWe think he will bring for us peace, love and hope,\u201d said Pascale Azaz, a nurse watching Leo\u2019s address next to Beirut\u2019s shimmering waterfront Tuesday, the last day of his trip. \u201cWe have been waiting years for this day.\u201d",
      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

      "While new slabs of white marble have replaced the old floor and the walls are freshly painted, the Rev. Miled Abboud is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV\u2019s visit to the blast site Tuesday will highlight the amount of rebuilding that still needs to be done. He also believes Leo's visit will bring \u201ca message of hope\u201d and reconciliation between Lebanon\u2019s diverse Christian communities \u2014 a large number of whom have left in recent years \u2014 and coexistence with the majority Muslim population.",
      "\u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a sign of hope,\u201d Abboud told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cThere are a lot of bleak things, of things that make us despair, but we have Christ who gives us strength to carry on.\u201d",
      "Abboud, who said he had only been a priest at this Maronite church for a few months, added that he hoped to restore it to its former glory to inspire the local community, although many younger members of his congregation have left the city or country altogether, largely because of the dire economy.",
      "\u201cThe majority of young people have moved to other regions or to the Gulf, to Europe, to France, because we have a lot of French universities here, so once they finish their studies, people move to France,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of them took the decision to leave in the aftermath of the massive August 2020 port explosion, which tore through Beirut after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse, according to Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "In total, 218 people were killed and 7,000 others wounded by the blast which devastated large swaths of the city, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "Much of the destruction was in \u201cmajority Christian neighborhoods of east Beirut,\u201d Salem said in a series of voice notes Monday. For some it was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d he added.",
      "As much as people loved their homeland, he said, the explosion \u201ctraumatized so many\u201d in the country, which was already reeling from an economic collapse and struggling to cope with an influx of around 1.5 million refugees who crossed into Lebanon as civil war-ravaged neighboring Syria. Some have returned to their country since the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year.",
      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",
      "But, he said, both Christians and Muslims had left during the civil war which wracked the country between 1975 and 1990 and the war with Israel in 2006.",
      "After the economic collapse, he said, \u201cthere weren\u2019t great jobs in Lebanon but there were in Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Riyadh or further afield in Canada or the U.S.\u201d Others had left to pursue higher education in the West, he added.",
      "More recently, the country has been rocked by the spillover of Israel's war in Gaza and also the war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah until a fragile ceasefire was brokered around a year ago.",
      "But just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",
      "In Gaza, the small surviving Christian community has seen churches shelled and worshippers killed during Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, while in the occupied West Bank, Christian communities have been targeted by Israeli settlers and the economy has suffered as tourists' numbers have dropped dramatically.",
      "While Lebanese Christians have lived in relative peace in the Muslim-majority country, the country\u2019s dire economic situation has led many to seek a new life abroad.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",
      "Together with his twin, Charbel Lteif, he has set up \u201cEastern Christians\u201d pages on social media, which have racked up almost 700,000 followers.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",

      "The body of just one Israeli hostage remains in Gaza, nearing the fulfillment of a key plank of President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point ceasefire plan for the enclave, but major hurdles exist to a planned second phase.",
      "Doubts remain over whether negotiators can overcome those obstacles, even as they face renewed pressure to advance into Phase 2 \u2014 a step intended to prevent any return to the high levels of violence that preceded the ceasefire.",
      "Trump noted last week that Phase 2 would commence \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without giving a more specific timetable. Axios reported Thursday that the White House is hoping to announce the second phase before Christmas and unveil the new governance structure for the enclave, citing two U.S. officials and a Western source directly involved in the process.",
      "Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s plan calls for the establishment of a new governing mechanism in Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the formation of an international stabilization force, known as the ISF, that would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has played a key role in a series of international negotiations, said Saturday that discussions were at a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. Mediators were working jointly to push the next phase of the ceasefire forward, he said during a panel at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, [until] there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out, which is not the case today,\u201d he said.",
      "Egypt\u2019s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told the conference that the international stabilization force was needed \u201cas soon as possible on the ground,\u201d while Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said measures must be put in place this month, warning the current ceasefire \u201ccannot hold for many more weeks in its current phase.\u201d",
      "As the international community hopes for progress, the ceasefire\u2019s trajectory so far underscores both its fragile gains and its persistent vulnerabilities.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect on Oct. 10, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel. The body of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has yet to be recovered despite a weekslong search effort. Israeli authorities have steadily released Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 as part of the exchange.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said all hostages must be returned before a Phase 2 deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week stressing the need for an \u201cintensive and immediate effort\u201d to complete the commitment.",
      "Israel agreed to halt its assault on the Gaza Strip during the ceasefire, but flare-ups and violence have persisted, with Israeli strikes killing more than 350 people since the ceasefire began, taking the death toll in the enclave beyond 70,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures.",
      "The first phase also included a commitment to expand the flow of aid into Gaza, but U.N. experts say the number of trucks permitted to enter has never reached the agreed target of 600 per day.",
      "Israel said Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing in the south will soon reopen to allow Palestinians to enter Egypt, but it will not reopen the crossing in both directions \u2014 another commitment under the deal \u2014 until Gvili\u2019s remains are returned.",
      "And as Phase 1 sputters along, analysts warn that Phase 2 presents a host of complex challenges, from security arrangements to competing governance demands, that could slow or even stall the process.",
      "Negotiators are \u201ctrying to square circles that simply cannot be squared,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "He wondered whether an international stabilization force could really dismantle Hamas, a target Israel was unable to achieve through two years of a \u201cbrutal\u201d military operation. While Trump\u2019s peace plan stipulates that Hamas will disarm, the group has reasserted control of Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire and shown no immediate signs of disarmament.",
      "Disarming Hamas through military intervention is \u201cnot exactly something that any other power is going to be interested in,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "And when it comes to Gaza\u2019s governance, Hellyer added, \u201cTrump can create his board of peace,\u201d referring to the group that would sit atop Gaza\u2019s governing structure under Trump\u2019s plan, but \u201cyou can\u2019t simply enforce this stuff on the ground without cooperation from the population, unless you just want to turn it into a new type of occupation.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Saturday that negotiations over the Gaza stabilization force remain ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.",
      "\u201cThousands of details, questions are in place,\u201d Fidan said. \u201cI think once we deploy ISF, the rest will come.\u201d",
      "But Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, echoed Hellyer\u2019s concerns, noting that so far, \u201cno state has agreed to support its forces into Gaza and potentially and ultimately get into confrontation with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Gerges also feared that \u201cwe will never see the actual implementation of what Phase 2 is supposed to be,\u201d adding it was \u201can illusion\u201d to call what\u2019s happening in Gaza a ceasefire, \u201cbecause the Palestinians, particularly civilians, continue to be killed on a daily basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though the humanitarian situation of the Palestinians has improved a bit, it\u2019s still catastrophic,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Navy on Thursday released the results of its investigation into four incidents involving the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group during its deployment to the Middle East in late 2024 through earlier this year.",
      "The incidents, which occurred between December 2024 and May 2025, involved the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets in the Red Sea and a collision between the carrier and a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt.",
      "The investigation found that a trip wire failure, poor computer signaling, \u201csubstandard maintenance practices\u201d and \u201coverall low-level knowledge\u201c among some of the carrier group\u2019s personnel contributed to the incidents, according to the report on the investigation. In December 2024, an accidental \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving two F/A-18s, where one was downed and the other was nearly missed, appeared to have occurred in part because of faulty combat systems, the report said.",
      "In April 2024, a fighter jet and a tow tractor were lost because of a maneuver the carrier made to try to avoid incoming fire from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the report said.",
      "As a result of the findings, the Navy is reviewing some systems and operations and will conduct more personnel training to try to prevent such incidents, according to the recommendations made in the investigation findings.",
      "\u201cThe Navy is committed to being a learning organization,\u201d the vice chief of naval operations, Adm. Jim Kilby, said in a written statement provided by the Navy.",
      "The Navy has said there were no personnel casualties or major injuries related to the incidents.",
      "The Navy\u2019s report said its investigation found that a December 2024 \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving the shooting down of an F/A-18F Super Hornet by the USS Gettysburg, a guided-missile cruiser, was caused by a \u201clack of integrated training opportunities between USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser, and lack of cohesion across the Carrier Strike Group.\u201d",
      "That lack of cohesion \u201ccontributed to the misidentification, and subsequent engagement, of the friendly aircraft and near miss of another,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThe investigation for the F-18 loss in December 2024 was determined that a lack of reintegrated training opportunities between the USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group contributed to the misidentification and subsequent engagement of the US Navy aircraft,\u201d Kilby said. \u201cThis was manifested through not following procedures, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser and lack of cohesion across Strike Group units.\u201d",
      "Before the incident, the Truman had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d defending against Houthi-launched anti-ship cruise missiles and one-way attack drones, the report said.",
      "The investigation also found that the USS Truman\u2019s February 2025 collision with a merchant vessel was \u201cavoidable,\u201d according to the report. The team aboard the Truman failed to safely navigate past the vessel.",
      "In addition, an April 2025 incident involving the loss of an F/A-18E Super Hornet and tow tractor was due to evasive maneuvers that the Truman took while responding to an incoming ballistic missile in the Red Sea, the report said. The investigation determined the aircraft brake system failed, in addition to \u201cinsufficient communication between the bridge, flight deck control, and hangar bay control.\u201d",
      "The investigation also found that a May 2025 incident involving another F/A-18 was caused by a failure of the trip wire aboard the USS Truman. Among the reasons, according to the report, were \u201csubstandard maintenance practices, substandard arresting gear, leadership and overall low-level knowledge\u201d among the personnel operating the trip wire."

      "The flooding last week damaged at least 300 to 400 works in one of the Egyptian antiquities libraries in the museum, Francis Steinbock, the deputy general administrator, told French broadcast station BFM TV.",
      "The flooding led to a burst pipe and affected one of the three rooms of the library in the Egyptian antiquities department, he said.",
      "A complete count of affected works is underway, he said.",
      "Steinbock described some of the works as books \u2014 some several hundred years old and dating to the late 19th century.

      "The 28-year-old migrant worker had arrived in the Chinese territory from the Philippines only a day earlier to work for a family living in a high-rise housing estate. When a massive fire ignited in the middle of the afternoon, tearing across seven of the estate\u2019s eight buildings, Alcaraz shielded the baby in her arms and was rescued by firefighters just in time, along with her employer\u2019s elderly mother.",
      "Hong Kong, an international financial hub of 7.5 million people, is home to hundreds of thousands of domestic helpers like Alcaraz, mostly women from low-income Asian countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia.",
      "The bravery of Alcaraz and other domestic helpers during the Nov. 27 blaze at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po, which killed at least 159 people, has put a spotlight on the critical role they play in the city, where they work for low wages and often live in cramped homes alongside employers who heavily rely on them for housework and caregiving.",
      "At least 10 domestic helpers were killed in the fire, including nine from Indonesia and one from the Philippines.",
      "\u201cWe are truly grateful for their selflessness and also their heroic acts during the fire,\u201d Chris Sun, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for labor and welfare, told reporters Tuesday.",
      "He added that families of the domestic helpers who died will receive about 800,000 Hong Kong dollars ($100,000) in condolence and compensation payments.",
      "The Tai Po fire, the deadliest in Hong Kong in almost 80 years, has shocked and angered the public amid accusations of corrupt business practices and failures in government oversight. Authorities say the rapid spread of the five-alarm fire was caused by the use of highly flammable materials around the buildings during renovations.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, John Lee, said this week that a judge-led independent committee would be set up to \u201creview\u201d the fire, which displaced thousands of people from their homes.

      "While authorities and aid agencies announced several support measures for affected residents, including transitional housing and a donor-supported reconstruction fund that has raised about 2.8 billion Hong Kong dollars ($360 million), the fire creates additional uncertainty for domestic helpers, who live in Hong Kong on dedicated visas and are entitled to far fewer rights than a typical resident.",
      "A helper\u2019s salary starts at about $650 a month.",
      "Even with an additional food allowance of about $160, they still earn below the minimum wage in Hong Kong, which at about $5.40 an hour amounts to $860 a month for a 40-hour workweek. They are also ineligible for permanent residency, which in most cases can be obtained by living in the city for seven years.",
      "Many domestic helpers are mothers themselves, sending most of their earnings to their children back home to support their education.",
      "\u201cThey have deep trauma now. Whenever they pass by the building, they always cry. Some had friends who died in that building,\u201d said Sring Sringatin, a domestic helper in Hong Kong who is chair of the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union.",
      "Sringatin said helpers from Wang Fuk Court were still residing with their employers, either in temporary shelters or alternative housing. Previously, they would often share a room with the family\u2019s children. Now that their employers are homeless, accommodating helpers has become even more difficult, according to Sringatin and other aid workers who have met with affected helpers.",
      "It is also unclear whether employers whose homes have been destroyed will be able to pay their salaries on time, even as the workers \u2014 who are so embedded with families that they often act as the primary caregivers to children and elderly relatives \u2014 continue providing care.",
      "\u201cThey just follow the families if there is care to be given,\u201d said Johannie Tong, a community relations officer for the nonprofit group Mission for Migrant Workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a default for them. The disaster has happened, but they are still working. They don\u2019t have this question, whether I should work,\u201d said Tong, who visited some of the displaced workers over the past week in government-run temporary shelters that journalists could not access.",
      "Before the fire, workers got little time to themselves. In most cases they worked six days a week, meeting fellow workers on Sundays at parks and other public places to sing karaoke, do each other\u2019s nails or enjoy picnics. Now they are not only traumatized, but they may also be facing more pressure at work and feeling isolated at a time when they are far away from their families, Tong and Sringatin said.",
      "\u201cThey are trying their best to perform their duties, but at the same time they need to be strong, because as a domestic worker there is this feeling that they don\u2019t have anyone in here,\u201d Sringatin said.",
      "Tong said her charity was trying to determine what kind of long-term help workers might need, including immigration assistance or support for their families back home. In the short term, she said, there are ample donations at their center in Hong Kong\u2019s Jordan neighborhood, where workers on Monday were sorting through clothes, toiletries, medicines and more.",
      "Mission for Migrant Workers said it had obtained a SIM card for Alcaraz to use to communicate with her family back in the Philippines.",

      "Leaders on the continent are feeling \u201cgenuine fear and distrust regarding the United States,\u201d Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who led Estonia for a decade until 2016, told NBC News in an interview Thursday. But he also warned that Europe\u2019s internal division \u201cultimately shows the weakness\u201d of the bloc, and he feared what might happen \u201cunless we start getting our act together.\u201d",
      "His comments came hours before European powers held urgent negotiations Friday on how to keep Ukraine\u2019s war effort alive and before President Donald Trump published his National Security Strategy that spelled out in black and white Washington\u2019s dissatisfaction toward many of its partners across the pond.",
      "Trump had already left Europe out of this week\u2019s negotiations between his envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Finding itself sidelined, the European Union is trying to formulate its own proposal: using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort. Even that, however, is facing opposition from Belgium, fearing Russian retaliation.",
      "Putin on Thursday reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met. He spoke after his predecessor, the hawkish Dmitry Medvedev, said using Russian money to aid Ukraine would be tantamount to a \u201ccasus belli\u201d \u2014 or an act justifying war \u2014 a common Kremlin refrain of his during the 45-month conflict.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time, I think, for Ukraine and for Europe,\u201d said Ilves, who served two stints as foreign minister before taking Estonia\u2019s top job.",
      "For Europe, this is about more than just Ukraine; they worry any peace that favors Putin will embolden him to attack and meddle elsewhere on the continent, which has seen an uptick in drone incursions and cyberattacks over the past year.",
      "His war machine is making slow progress on the battlefield but suffering heavy casualties. Kyiv, meanwhile, is running low on money and resources, while suffering a manpower shortage and facing allegations of governmental corruption."

      "Musk did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment, but several hours before the European Commission released details on the fine, he shared an X post from Preston Byrne, which advocated for the passage of a U.S. bill that would allow companies and individuals to sue foreign entities in American court over claims of foreign censorship.",

      "But Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission criticized the decision in a post on X. \u201cOnce again, Europe is fining a successful U.S. tech company for being a successful U.S. tech company,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEurope is taxing Americans to subsidize a continent held back by Europe's own suffocating regulations.\u201d",
      "The proposed penalty nearly two years in the making came after regulators said in late 2023 that they had opened proceedings into X over suspected failure to combat content disinformation and manipulation. X was the first company to face such an investigation when the probe started.",
      "At the start, regulators said the proceedings were about several issues including the alleged dissemination of illegal content \u201cin the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel\u201d and a suspicion that X had a \u201cdeceptive design\u201d in how it handed out blue verification checks to paying users.",
      "Musk, the wealthiest person in the world by some measures, has had rocky relations with European leaders even aside from the investigation into X. In January, the leaders of four European countries, including France and Germany, denounced his influence and warned that Musk should not involve himself in their nations\u2019 domestic politics.",
      "Musk, a former close ally of President Donald Trump, has helped to fuel a wave of far-right candidates across Europe and the globe, although many of his candidates have fallen short of winning power.",
      "X could appeal the commission\u2019s findings in European courts.",
      "In April, after rumors spread that the commission was on the verge of issuing a penalty against X, the company said it was prepared to fight.",
      "\u201cIf the reports that the European Commission is considering enforcement actions against X are accurate, it represents an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech,\u201d the company said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cX has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe,\u201d the company said."

      "Usually known more for pop anthems and extravagant costumes than for political disagreements, the Eurovision Song Contest is facing a major boycott after a push to eject Israel from the contest was rejected.",
      "National broadcasters from Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands all said they would not take part in the 2026 contest, citing Israel\u2019s continued participation in the contest amid the war in Gaza.",
      "In public statements on Thursday, Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS cited the \u201chumanitarian suffering in Gaza\u201d and alleged \u201cpolitical interference\u201d in the contest, while Ireland\u2019s RT\u00c9 said its continued participation was \u201cunconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there.\u201d",
      "Alfonso Morales, secretary-general of Spanish broadcaster RTVE, said \u201cthe situation in Gaza, despite the ceasefire and the approval of the peace process, and Israel\u2019s use of the contest for political purposes, make it increasingly difficult to maintain Eurovision as a neutral cultural event.\u201d",

      "A push to ban Israel from the contest came to a head at a meeting of broadcasters on Thursday, but no vote was ultimately held on doing so. Austria, the host of next year\u2019s contest, supported Israel\u2019s continued participation.",
      "Israeli broadcaster KAN said in a statement to NBC News that it had engaged in discussions \u201cto prevent Israel\u2019s disqualification from the competition,\u201d with support from Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog.",

      "Germany, one of the contest\u2019s biggest funders, had threatened to withdraw if Israel was excluded. Its participating broadcaster SWR expressed \"deep regret\" at the boycott but said a vote on excluding Israel was \u201cnot required\u201d as it welcomed other changes to the contest\u2019s rules.

      "Israel has competed since 1973 and is eligible to take part because its broadcaster KAN is a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "But Israeli participation has come under pressure since the war in Gaza began two years ago, with an apparent surge in public support for Israel\u2019s entries as well as protests and calls for a boycott.",
      "Israel\u2019s 2025 entrant, Yuval Raphael, placed first in the public televote during the contest in May, but was ranked significantly lower by the expert juries of music industry professionals who allocate half of the points on offer at the contest.",

      "The EBU\u2019s own independent news service, citing Google advertising transparency data, reported in May that advertisements from the Israeli government ran across Europe encouraging supporters to \u201cvote up to 20 times\u201d for Raphael.",

      "Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said the contest would also \u201cstrengthen enforcement of our existing rules to prevent any misuse of the Contest for example through song lyrics or staging.\u201d",
      "In its statement, KAN denied it was \u201cinvolved in any prohibited campaign intended to influence the results of the latest contest.\u201d",
      "The EBU said in a statement that a \u201clarge majority of Members\u201d had agreed with its proposed changes Thursday after \u201ca wide-ranging discussion where Members expressed a variety of views on participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.\u201d",
      "Broadcasters \u201cwill now be asked to confirm their participation,\u201d it said amid speculation that more countries could withdraw, with a final list of participants expected before Christmas.",

      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that despite the absence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 believed to be the first time in 22 years that America's top diplomat did not attend a ministerial gathering of this kind \u2014 he remained \"very much involved\" in the process.",
      "Rutte later told journalists that President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts were central to ending the war.",
      "\u201cThere is only one person in the whole world who was able to break the deadlock ... and that is the American president,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Trump said at a gathering of reporters Wednesday that special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner had a good meeting with Putin on Tuesday.",
      "\"What comes out of that meeting? I can\u2019t tell you, because it does take two to tango,\" Trump said.",
      "He added: \"Their impression was that they\u2019d like to, he would like to see the war ended. I think he\u2019d like to get back to dealing a more normal life. I think I\u2019d like to be trading with the United States of America, frankly, instead of losing thousands of soldiers a week. But their impression was very strongly that he\u2019d like to make a deal.\"",
      "Following the meeting with Putin in Moscow, Witkoff and Kushner invited Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, to a meeting in Miami on Thursday, a senior U.S. official told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Umerov accepted, the official said, and negotiations for a potential peace deal will continue in Florida on Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X that world powers need to keep pressuring Russia about the conflict.",
      "\"Right now, the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war, and current diplomatic activity in negotiations must be backed by pressure on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everything depends on this combination \u2014 constructive diplomacy plus pressure on the aggressor. Both components work toward peace.\"",

      "European leaders were also blindsided by Trump\u2019s 28-point plan last month, which was seen as leaving not just Ukraine, but also the whole continent vulnerable.",
      "Rubio's absence from the summit was \"unusual,\" said William Alberque, NATO's former arms control director. The last time he could remember such an absence was when Colin Powell was absent in 2003, which was attributed to the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.",
      "Asked why Rubio would not meet with NATO allies, especially during the ongoing Ukraine war negotiations, a senior State Department official told NBC News that he \"has already attended dozens of meetings with NATO allies, and it would be completely impractical to expect him at every meeting.\"",
      "Despite having been sidelined in discussions between Moscow and Washington, European leaders could still have \"a direct impact on the talks\" and \"continue to guide the process,\" Alberque said.",
      "He added that \"it may seem that the Europeans are powerless in the face of Trump\u2019s style of leadership\" but that \"we already have seen the so-called 'peace plan' change radically over the past days, with Ukrainian and European concerns increasingly reflected.\"",
      "Before he met with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday, Putin launched into a tirade against Europe, criticizing European leaders for hindering Trump\u2019s peace efforts, from which, he said, Europe has removed itself. Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, he told reporters, but if Europe starts a war, there can be no doubt about Russia\u2019s readiness to respond \u201cright now.\u201d",
      "Stefan Wolff, a professor of international security at England\u2019s University of Birmingham, said Putin's rhetoric was part of the Russian narrative that Europe is undermining Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war and that if it weren't for European obstruction, a deal would long ago have been done.",
      "\"That is probably true, but it's a good thing, because any such deal would be bad for Ukraine, bad for Europe and ultimately bad for the U.S.,\u201d he said.",

Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the talks were the first such \u201cdirect exchange of opinions,\u201d adding that Putin did not reject the U.S. plan.",

      "Nearly four years after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, with Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling to strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government and forced the resignation of his top negotiator.",
      "Kyiv and its allies view Witkoff, the man whom Washington has sent to negotiate with Putin this week, with suspicion after a leaked phone call suggested he was advising Moscow on how to deal with Trump, according to a transcript published by Bloomberg News.",
      "Ushakov said in the Kremlin video that the meeting Tuesday was \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations. \u201cWe specifically discussed territorial issues, without which we see no resolution to the crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "Witkoff presented the Russians with several documents. \u201cThere was a document containing 27 points. We naturally reviewed it. However, we didn\u2019t work on the wording, and there were no discussions with our American colleagues about it,\u201d Ushakov said, noting that the Americans gave the Russians four additional documents.",
      "He added: \u201cA compromise hasn\u2019t been found yet, but some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the language we\u2019ve been offered is acceptable. The work will continue. It is indeed one of the most important questions.\u201d",
      "Ushakov said that contacts would continue \u201cat the level of representatives, aides and other representatives, in particular with these two people who arrived in the Kremlin today,\u201d but that no meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled.",
      "Asked by a journalist whether an end to the conflict was now closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow. This has been agreed upon, and contacts will continue.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired  Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was necessary to push both sides to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis has now become a war of attrition, and sadly, the Russians have shown their willingness to sacrifice 7,000 soldiers a week in an effort to achieve this,\u201d Rubio said.",

Horowitz, an independent geopolitical and security analyst who has followed the war closely.",
      "From Ukraine\u2019s perspective, acceding to most of Russia\u2019s demands would set it up for a third invasion, \u201cafter 2014 and 2022,\u201d Horowitz added, referring to Russia\u2019s military backing of separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014 and the full-scale invasion eight years later.",
      "The 'three pillars'",
      "Putin has never hidden his hard-line demands.",
      "He has sought the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial region of Donbas, comprising the contested Donetsk region and Russian-controlled Luhansk. (Russia holds about one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory.) He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering it defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d a Russian official briefed on the matter said on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from the venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the war has not devastated the Russian economy, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov said.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",
      "But Putin is unlikely to truly end the war without intense pressure from the U.S., he said.",
      "What could Putin accept?",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow fresh from talks with Ukraine in Florida this weekend, which both Washington and Kyiv deemed productive, without sharing details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 which Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for Putin, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think those demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine's \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London."

      "Trump, however, focused most of his ire on Somalia and Omar, who was born in Somalia and has served in Congress since 2019.",
      "\u201cWith Somalia, which is barely a country, you know, they have no, they have no anything. They just run around killing each other. There\u2019s no structure,\u201d he said before turning to Omar, a progressive Democrat and Somali American he\u2019s mocked and targeted for years.",

    "story": [
      "A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's envoy and his son-in-law lasted five hours Tuesday but ended without clear progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russian officials called the meeting with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow \"constructive\" and \"productive.\" But neither side released details of how the talks might bridge the chasm between Russia's unwavering demands and the assurances sought by Ukraine and its frozen-out European backers.",
      "Beforehand, Putin called Europe's attempts to influence the U.S.-led peace talks \"absolutely unacceptable\" and said that while he did not want war with Europe, Russia was ready for one if necessary. Sidelined European powers were meeting Wednesday at a NATO summit in Belgium, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio took the rare step of skipping the summit altogether.",
      "Putin's foreign adviser Yuri Ushakov called Tuesday's meeting \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations.",
      "Russian officials had reviewed a number of documents presented by the American delegation, and that some proposals \"seem more-or-less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Asked whether an end to the conflict was closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow.\"",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was  \"waiting for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia,\" adding that it was important \"everything is fair and transparent and that \"there are no games played behind Ukraine's back.\"",
      "United States officials did not comment on the Moscow talks and the next steps for the American team were not clear.",
      "Zelenskyy said earlier Tuesday, during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, that \"if the signals align and if there is fair play from our partners, we may meet very soon.\"",
      "Ukraine and Europe say they are concerned about being sidelined in the negotiations that will directly influence their safety and security on the continent. There are widespread fears that a favorable deal for Putin will embolden him to attack elsewhere.",
      "A leaked 28-point plan the U.S. proposed last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia. It would have forced Kyiv to cede its territories to Moscow, including the land that it currently controls. It would have limited the size of Kyiv\u2019s army and barred Ukraine from ever joining NATO.",
      "The proposal blindsided Kyiv, which launched a storm of negotiations in Europe and the U.S. to try to amend the plan and make it more palatable to Ukraine.",
      "It comes as Zelenskyy\u2019s government is on the back foot on the battlefield, while rocked by a major corruption scandal. His powerful chief of staff and top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, resigned last week after being implicated in the probe.",
      "Shortly before his scheduled meeting with the American delegation, Putin addressed an investment forum where he said his army held the advantage in Ukraine, while criticizing European leaders for hindering the peace process.",
      "Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, but if Europe starts a war, Russia is ready \u201cright now,\u201d Putin told reporters. \"If Europe suddenly wants to start a war with us and does, then we could quickly get a situation in which we have no one to negotiate with.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in what has become Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Despite Russia expecting Ukraine to surrender in a matter of days, the war has dragged on. The Ukrainian army, backed by Western weapons, has managed to not only resist the onslaught, but also counterattack. Still, Russian forces are now in control of roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.",
      "The Russian leader signaled last week that he was ready for a \u201cserious\u201d discussion with the U.S. and said that a version of the plan that was agreed during talks with Ukrainian officials in Geneva last month could form the \u201cframework\u201d of a final peace settlement. Still, he said his army had the upper hand on the battlefield and if no agreement was reached, he would get what he wanted by force.",
      "Wearing a military uniform, Putin received reports from his generals Monday that Russian troops have completely \u201cliberated\u201d the city of Pokrovsk, an important Ukrainian transport and supply hub in the Donetsk region. Ukraine denied reports that the city was entirely under Russian control. Pokrovsk\u2019s capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger cities and the whole region.",
      "On the streets of Moscow, meanwhile, some expressed hope for an agreement and peace.",
      "\"Everyone is tired of this,\" Igor Andreev, 39, told NBC News in central Moscow, standing on a street opposite the U.S. Embassy. \"I can\u2019t afford many products,\" said Andreev, who works in marketing. \"We are in isolation; I can\u2019t go to another country. Everyone is tired of this situation. I think it needs to end in peace. Everyone is tired of [hearing about] victims. We want love to prevail.\""
