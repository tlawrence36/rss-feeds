      "Hungarian authorities have banned the Irish-language rap group Kneecap from entering the country",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Members of the Irish-language rap group Kneecap were banned from entering Hungary ahead of their scheduled performance at the popular Sziget Festival as authorities argued the musicians' presence in the country would constitute a risk to national security.",
      "The Belfast trio, scheduled to play on Sziget's closing day on Aug. 11, is known for anarchic energy, satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the U.K., with the Republic of Ireland.",
      "The group has faced criticism for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references and for political statements seeming to glorify militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause throughout Israel's war in Gaza and say they don\u2019t support Hezbollah and Hamas nor condone violence.",
      "Hungary's immigration authority, the National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing, published decrees on Thursday declaring Kneecap members Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in, J.J. \u00d3 Dochartaigh and Liam \u00d3g \u00d3hAnnaidh would be banned from Hungary's territory for three years since their \u201centry and stay constitute a serious threat to national security.\u201d",

      "Hungarian authorities and other groups had earlier pushed Sziget Festival to cancel the band's performance. Hungary's minister for European affairs, J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka, noted the government\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy toward antisemitism in a July 11 letter to the festival's organizers.",
      "Hundreds of figures from Hungary's music and cultural community also have signed a petition calling for Kneecap's performance to be cancelled.",
      "The group performed in April at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California, where they accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians enabled by the U.S. government. That sparked calls for the rappers\u2019 U.S. visas to be revoked and several Kneecap gigs have since been canceled as a result.",

      "George Kooymans, guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring, has died at 77",
      "NEW YORK -- George Kooymans, the guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring who co-wrote the hard-rock classic \u201cRadar Love\u201d and wrote and shared lead vocals on the top 10 hit \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Kooymans' family and the surviving members of Golden Earring announced that he had died Wednesday from complications of ALS, which he had been diagnosed with in 2020. He retired from the band soon after.",
      "\u201cGeorge bore this devastating and debilitating illness with exceptional strength and dignity,\u201d the statement from Golden Earring reads in part. \u201cWe bid farewell to a great musician and composer, whose work extended beyond Golden Earring. George was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, but above all, a friend.\u201d",
      "A native of The Hague, Kooymans was in his mid-teens when he helped found what became Golden Earring in the early 1960s: The band's name was inspired by an instrumental of the time, \u201cGolden Earrings.\u201d He was also a core member of the group's best known lineup, which featured drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk, singer-guitarist Barry Hay and bassist-keyboardist Rinus Gerritsen and stayed together from 1970 until Koosyman's departure.",
      "With more than 20 top 10 singles in their native country, Golden Earring had more success at home than overseas. But they began to attract an underground following in the U.S. in the late 1960s and broke through commercially in 1973 with the worldwide hit \u201cRadar Love,\" which has been covered by U2, R.E.M. and hundreds of others and used on the soundtrack to \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d \u201cWayne's World 2\u201d and other films.",
      "\u201cRadar Love,\u201d with its stately opening riff and memorable opening line \u201cI\u2019ve been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel,\u201d was once ranked by Rolling Stone as among the greatest road trip songs.",

      "Golden Earring continued to tour and record in the 1990s and beyond.

YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",

      "Since its initial release in 1973, \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d has never been reissued and is not currently available on streaming platforms. The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",
      "Despite their relative inexperience, \u201cit stands up in a way you would hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work,\u201d Buckingham says, according to the announcement release.",
      "The reissue announcement was foreshadowed by cryptic Instagram posts last week. Both Nicks and Buckingham shared handwritten lyrics to their official social media accounts.",
      "\u201cAnd if you go forward\u2026\u201d Nicks posted, a line from their song \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d which appears on \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Buckingham shared, completing the lyric.",

He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, an expected move that has the U.S. further retreating from international organizations.",
      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration had rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after citing concerns that China was filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education.",
      "\u201cUnilaterally withdrawing the United States from UNESCO is another assault by the Trump administration on international cooperation and U.S. global leadership,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said.",

While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",

      "NEW YORK -- There are pioneering music figures, and then there is Ozzy Osbourne, the larger-than-life frontman of Black Sabbath, whose personal mythology is eclipsed only by the strength and immortality of his songs.",
      "A godfather and force of heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday at 76, just weeks after his last performance.",
      "The English icon's idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations of metalheads, both through his work at the reins of Black Sabbath and in his solo career. Across his repertoire, there are songs with total global ubiquity and lesser-known innovations with his unique, spooky aesthetic quality.",
      "To celebrate Osbourne\u2019s life and legacy, we've selected just a few songs that made the man, from timeless tunes to a few left-of-center selections.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist.",
      "It would be a challenge to name a more immediately recognizable guitar riff than the one that launches Black Sabbath's 1970 megahit \u201cIron Man.\u201d It transcends the metal genre \u2014 an all-timer heard around the world and in guitar stores everywhere.",
      "One of the great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath's \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is a rare moment where hippies and metalheads can agree: \u201cPoliticians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight?\u201d Osbourne sings in the bridge.",
      "Osbourne's heaviest performances are at least partially indebted to Black Sabbath's bassist and lyricist Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler, and there is perhaps no better example than \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d the single from the band's 1971 album, \u201cMaster of Reality.\u201d \u201cMust the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?\u201d Osbourne embodies Butler's words, a sonic fist lifted in the air. \u201cCan they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?\u201d",

      "Another classic cut from Osbourne's debut solo album, \u201cBlizzard Of Ozz\u201d \u2014 released one year after Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath for his legendary excesses, \u2014 the arena rock anthem \u201cMr. Crowley\u201d pays tribute to the famed English occultist Aleister Crowley and features Deep Purple's Don Airey on keyboard.",
      "The title track and coda of Osbourne's second solo studio album, \u201cDiary of a Madman,\u201d runs over six minutes long, features big strings and a choir so theatrical it sounds like they're scoring a medieval war film. He wanted big, he wanted dramatic, and he nailed it.",

      "When Black Sabbath comes to mind, most fans jump to an unimpeachable run of albums released in the '70s and early \u201980s. But \u201cI,\u201d a cut from Black Sabbath's too often overlooked 16th studio album, \u201cDehumanizer,\u201d is worth your ear. And not only because it is the first Sabbath album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice since 1981's \u201cMob Rules,\u201d though that's an obvious plus.",
      "Late in life Ozzy Osbourne was generous with his time and talent, often collaborating with younger performers who idolized the metal legend. One such example is Post Malone's \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d which also features the rapper Travis Scott. Osbourne gives the song a necessary gothic edge \u2014 validating the otherwise balladic song's use of a sprightly guitar solo.",

      "During its relatively short run from 2002 to 2005, \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d became a runaway hit and made stars of his wife Sharon and kids Jack and Kelly. But more than that, it made a star of the domesticated version of Ozzy Osbourne, and in the process changed reality TV.",
      "In 2025, when virtually every variety of celebrity has had a reality show, it's hard to see what a novelty the series was. MTV sold it as television's first \u201creality sitcom.\"",
      "\u201cJust the idea of the Black Sabbath founder, who will forever be known for biting the head off a bat during a 1982 concert, as a family man seems strange,\u201d Associated Press Media Writer David Bauder wrote on the eve of \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiere. But on the show, Osbourne was \"sweetly funny \u2014 and under everything a lot like the put-upon dads you\u2019ve been seeing in television sitcoms for generations.\u201d",
      "Danny Deraney, a publicist who worked with Osbourne and was a lifelong fan, said of the show, \"You saw some guy who was curious. You saw some guy who was being funny. You just saw pretty much the real thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not the guy that everyone associates with the \u2018Prince of Darkness\u2019 and all this craziness,\u201d Deraney said. \"And people loved him. He became so affable to so many people because of that show. As metal fans, we knew it. We knew that\u2019s who he was. But now everyone knew.\u201d",
      "Reality shows at the time, especially the popular competition shows like \u201cSurvivor,\u201d thrived on heightened circumstances. For \u201cThe Osbournes,\u201d no stakes were too low.",
      "They sat on the couch. They ate dinner. The now-sober Ozzy sipped Diet Cokes, and urged his kids not to indulge in alcohol or drugs when they went out. He struggled to find the History Channel on his satellite TV. They feuded with the neighbors because, of all things, their loud music was driving the Osbournes crazy.",
      "\u201cYou were seeing this really fascinating, appealing, bizarre tension between the public persona of a celebrity and their mundane experiences at home,\u201d said Kathryn VanArendonk, a critic for Vulture and New York Magazine.",

      "Like family sitcoms, the affection its leads clearly had for each other was essential to its appeal.",

      "John Oliver brought his quirky humor to minor league baseball with the debut of the Erie Moon Mammoths",
      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",

      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",

      "\u201cThe greatest artists are the ones that draw, create, build, shoot in the face of negativity and who paint pictures of what they see in the times that they live in,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cYou can only do that if you live in this culture. You can do that if you've lived and experienced it. You can't do that from a high-rise building with no pain. These guys come from adversity in life and sports.\u201d",

      "In Antinoro's eyes, it could become the Oscars of athlete-driven storytelling with satellite versions popping up in the NBA arenas throughout the season. He sees value in helping standout projects secure the final funding and reach the right distributors.",
      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",
      "\u201cThat was the power of storytelling, the unity of sports and bringing people together in community,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the idea. These are the stories people need to see. They need to be out there in the world.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "\u201cIt was literally us driving around and going, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s a bunch of mobile home parks!\u2019\u201d said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA\u2019s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region.",
      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",

      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",
      "Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients.",
      "Adding to the complexity, two government agencies \u2014 HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process.",

      "Hospitals are required to alert their area OPO to every potential donor who is declared brain-dead or once the decision to withdraw life support is made. The OPOs by law can't participate in that decision and \"we are not even in the room at that time,\u201d said Barry Massa of Kentucky's Network for Hope.",
      "During the following days of preparation, hospital employees continue caring for the patient \u2013 while the donation team talks with the family about the process, gathers hospital records showing the patient is eligible, requests tests of organ quality, and make arrangements with transplant centers to use them.",
      "Once the hospital withdraws life support and the heart stops beating there\u2019s a mandatory wait \u2013 five minutes \u2013 to be sure it won\u2019t restart. When the doctor declares death, the organ retrieval process can begin.",
      "Organs are only considered usable if death occurs relatively quickly, usually up to about two hours. Sometimes that takes much longer and thus the organs can\u2019t be used \u2013 and HRSA\u2019s Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was done wrong. Still, he said HRSA is investigating reports of possible mistakes elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is a technically demanding form of care\u201d that requires \u201cgood collaboration between the OPO and the hospital,\u201d he said.",
      "At issue is how doctors are sure when it\u2019s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient \u2014 and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs.",
      "In May, HRSA quietly ordered the U.S. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone \u2013 family, hospital staff or organ donation staff \u2013 can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient\u2019s eligibility.",
      "Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff \u201ca clear understanding\u201d of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.",
      "Kentucky's Massa said his group only received HRSA\u2019s reports this week \u2013 but that after learning about last fall\u2019s allegations, it made some changes.

      "FALL RIVER, Mass. -- Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said Tuesday the state would provide money to improve public safety staffing for the city of Fall River in the wake of last week's fire at an assisted-living facility that killed 10 people.",
      "The July 13 fire at Gabriel House was the state\u2019s deadliest fire in more than four decades. The blaze left some residents of hanging out windows of the three-story building screaming for help. Members of the local firefighter\u2019s union said lack of emergency personnel staffing in the city made responding to the blaze more difficult, and made the fire itself deadlier.",
      "The fire in the blue-collar city in southern Massachusetts remains under investigation, but it has highlighted the lack of regulations governing assisted-living facilities that often care for low-income or disabled residents.",
      "Following a meeting with city officials, Healey said the state was releasing $1.2 million for Fall River to hire more emergency response personnel. She also said additional funds will be expedited for the state\u2019s municipal public safety staffing program.",
      "\u201cWe are here today to listen to make sure that we understand what this community needs now and moving forward in the wake of this tragedy,\u201d Healey said.",
      "Healey said last week that a state agency that ensures regulatory compliance at assisted-living residences will investigate all 273 such facilities in Massachusetts to make sure they are prepared to protect residents during emergencies. She said Tuesday that work has begun.",
      "Later Tuesday, the Bristol County district attorney's office is expected to hold a news conference to provide an update on the investigation. Although the cause of the fire remains unknown, authorities have said it does not appear to be suspicious.",
      "The district attorney's office identified the 10th victim as Halina Lawler, 70, on Monday. The victims of the fire ranged in age from 61 to 86.",
      "A resident of Gabriel House filed a lawsuit Monday alleging the facility was not properly managed, staffed or maintained, that residency rules were not enforced \u201cand emergency response procedures were not put in place.\u201d",
      "Trapped in his room during the fire, Steven Oldrid was in an \u201calready compromised physical condition\u201d when he suffered smoke inhalation and lost consciousness, according to the complaint filed in Bristol County Superior Court. As a result, Oldrid says he has increased mobility restrictions and has racked up medical bills for treatment.",
      "George K. Regan Jr., a spokesperson for the facility owned by Dennis Etzkorn, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. A phone message was also left with Oldrid\u2019s attorney.",

      "Three Democratic-led states that led the way in offering free health care to low-income people who are in the U.S. without legal permission are either limiting or ending the programs because of significant budget concerns",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For nearly 20 years, Maria would call her sister \u2014 a nurse in Mexico \u2014 for advice on how to manage her asthma and control her husband\u2019s diabetes instead of going to the doctor in California.",
      "She didn\u2019t have legal status, so she couldn\u2019t get health insurance and skipped routine exams, relying instead on home remedies and, at times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted on using only her first name for fear of deportation.",
      "Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. Maria and her husband signed up the day the program began last year.",
      "\u201cIt changed immensely, like from Earth to the heavens,\u201d Maria said in Spanish of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program. \u201cHaving the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.\u201d",
      "At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. But three of them have done an about-face, ending or limiting coverage for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally in California, Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The programs cost way more than officials had projected at a time when the states are facing multibillion-dollar deficits now and in the future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care to save an estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants in Minnesota no longer have access to the state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California, no one will automatically lose coverage, but new enrollments for adults will stop in 2026 to save more than $3 billion over several years.",
      "Cuts in all three states were backed by Democratic governors who once championed expanding health coverage to immigrants.",
      "The Trump administration this week shared the home addresses, ethnicities and personal data of all Medicaid recipients with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Twenty states, including California, Illinois and Minnesota, have sued.",
      "Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially the fear of being arrested or deported, is having a chilling effect on people seeking care. And states may have to spend more money down the road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care and end up needing to go to safety-net hospitals.",
      "\u201cI feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you\u2019ll burst,\u201d Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "People who run free and community health clinics in California and Minnesota said patients who got on state Medicaid programs received knee replacements and heart procedures, and were diagnosed for serious conditions like late-stage cancer.",
      "CommunityHealth is one of the nation\u2019s largest free clinics, serving many uninsured and underinsured immigrants in the Chicago area who have no other options for treatment. That includes the people who lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended its Health Benefits for Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.",
      "One of CommunityHealth\u2019s community outreach workers and care coordinator said Eastern European patients she works with started coming in with questions about what the change meant for them. She said many of the patients also don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t have transportation to get to clinics that can treat them. The worker spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Health Finders Collective in Minnesota's rural Rice and Steele counties south of Minneapolis serves low-income and underinsured patients, including large populations of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they\u2019re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year.",
      "Free and community health clinics in all three states say they will keep serving patients regardless of insurance coverage \u2014 but that might get harder after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decided this month to restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.",
      "CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said she always worried about the stability of the program because it was fully state funded, \u201cbut truthfully, we thought that day was much, much further away.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die. Some people are going to go untreated,\u201d Alicia Hardy, chief executive officer of CommuniCARE+OLE clinics in California, said of the state's Medicaid changes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the humanity in the decision-making that\u2019s happening right now.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health said ending the state\u2019s program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending in the short term, but she acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care at hospitals.",

      "But he anticipated other providers who billed through the program could close, he said, adding: \u201cThings can become unstable very quickly.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers said California\u2019s Medi-Cal changes stem from budget issues \u2014 a $12 billion deficit this year, with larger ones projected ahead. Democratic state leaders last month agreed to stop new enrollment starting in 2026 for all low-income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining on the program will have to pay a $30 monthly fee in 2027.",
      "States are also bracing for impact from federal policies. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the recently signed massive tax and spending bill include a 10% cut to the federal share of Medicaid expansion costs to states that offer health benefits to immigrants starting October 2027.",
      "California health officials estimate roughly 200,000 people will lose coverage after the first full year of restricted enrollment, though Gov. Gavin Newsom maintains that even with the rollbacks, California provides the most expansive health care coverage for poor adults.",
      "Every new bill requires a shift in Maria's monthly calculations to make ends meet. She believes many people won\u2019t be able to afford the $30-a-month premiums and will instead go back to self-medication or skip treatment altogether.",
      "\u201cIt was a total triumph,\u201d she said of Medi-Cal expansion. \u201cBut now that all of this is coming our way, we\u2019re going backwards to a worse place.\u201d",

Providers told the AP that, as immigration raids ramped up, their patients were requesting more virtual appointments, not showing up to routine doctor\u2019s visits and not picking up prescriptions for their chronic conditions.",
      "Maria has the option to keep her coverage. But she is weighing the health of her family against risking what they\u2019ve built in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d Maria said of her decision to remain on the program. \u201cIf it comes to the point where my husband gets sick and his life is at risk, well then, obviously, we have to choose his life.\u201d",

      "In the southeast corner of Uruguay, home to Punta del Este, a beachy, palm-fringed haven for jet-set elites from all over the world, authorities recently allocated $625,000 for efforts to dispose of infected trees and lure weevils away from affected areas with pheromone traps and other methods.",
      "\u201cWe are losing our palm trees,\u201d lamented Montevideo resident Rafael dos Santos as he walked his dog in Parque Rod\u00f3. \u201cThey are historic in Uruguay, and a part of us.\u201d",
      "As the weevil's march continues unabated, authorities now fear native trees of Uruguay's UNESCO biosphere reserve bordering Brazil will fall victim next, potentially facilitating the spread of the parasite across an unprepared continent.",

      "For six hours every day after school, Nahideh works in a cemetery, collecting water from a nearby shrine to sell to mourners visiting loved ones\u2019 graves",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- For six hours every day after school, Nahideh works in a cemetery, collecting water from a nearby shrine to sell to mourners visiting loved ones\u2019 graves. She dreams of becoming a doctor \u2014 but knows it is a futile dream.",
      "When the next school year starts, she will be enrolling in a madrassa, a religious school, to learn about the Quran and Islam \u2014 and little else.",
      "\u201cI prefer to go to school, but I can\u2019t, so I will go to a madrassa,\u201d she said, dark brown eyes peering out from beneath her tightly wrapped black headscarf. \u201cIf I could go to school then I could learn and become a doctor. But I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At the age of 13, Nahideh is in the last grade of primary school, the limit of education allowed for girls in Afghanistan. The country\u2019s Taliban government banned girls from secondary school and university three years ago \u2014 the only country in the world to do so. The ban is part of myriad restrictions on women and girls, dictating everything from what they can wear to where they can go and who they can go with.",
      "With no option for higher education, many girls and women are turning to madrassas instead.",
      "\u201cSince the schools are closed to girls, they see this as an opportunity,\u201d said Zahid-ur-Rehman Sahibi, director of the Tasnim Nasrat Islamic Sciences Educational Center in Kabul. \u201cSo, they come here to stay engaged in learning and studying religious sciences.\u201d",
      "The center\u2019s roughly 400 students range in ages from about 3 to 60, and 90% are female. They study the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, and Arabic, the language of the Quran.",
      "Most Afghans, Sahibi noted, are religious. \u201cEven before the schools were closed, many used to attend madrassas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the closure of schools, the interest has increased significantly, because the doors of the madrassas remain open to them.\u201d",
      "No recent official figures are available on the number of girls enrolled in madrassas, but officials say the popularity of religious schools overall has been growing. Last September, Deputy Minister of Education Karamatullah Akhundzada said at least 1 million students had enrolled in madrassas over the past year alone, bringing the total to over 3 million.",
      "Sheltered from the heat of an early summer\u2019s day in a basement room at the Tasnim Nasrat center, Sahibi\u2019s students knelt at small plastic tables on the carpeted floor, their pencils tracing lines of Arabic script in their Qurans. All 10 young women wore black niqabs, the all-encompassing garment that includes a veil, leaving only the eyes visible.",
      "\u201cIt is very good for girls and women to study at a madrassa, because \u2026 the Quran is the word of Allah, and we are Muslims,\u201d said 25-year-old Faiza, who had enrolled at the center five months earlier. \u201cTherefore, it is our duty to know what is in the book that Allah has revealed to us, to understand its interpretation and translation.\u201d",
      "Given a choice, she would have studied medicine. While she knows that is now impossible, she still harbors hope that if she shows she is a pious student dedicated to her religion, she will be eventually allowed to. The medical profession is one of the very few still open to women in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhen my family sees that I am learning Quranic sciences and that I am practicing all the teachings of the Quran in my life, and they are assured of this, they will definitely allow me to continue my studies,\u201d she said.",

      "His madrassa first opened five years ago with 35 students. Now it has 160 boys aged 5-21, half of whom are boarders. Beyond religious studies, it offers a limited number of other classes such as English and math. There is also an affiliated girls\u2019 madrassa, which currently has 90 students, he said.",

      "France's justice minister is transferring 100 of the country\u2019s most dangerous inmates to a high-security prison to prevent them from running criminal operations from behind bars",
      "PARIS -- They are France 's most dangerous drug kingpins, according to the country's justice minister \u2014 prison inmates so wealthy and powerful that even behind bars, they can continue to order assassinations, run narco-trafficking operations and launder money.",
      "Flexing his powers as minister in charge of the French penal system, G\u00e9rald Darmanin's solution to the problem is contentious. He is moving 100 inmates \u2014 men he describes as \u201cFrance\u2019s biggest criminals\u201d \u2014 into an austere maximum security penitentiary in the country's north that critics say has echoes of tough U.S. prisons.",
      "The move is also possibly vote-catching for Darmanin, who has joined a growing field of possible successors to President Emmanuel Macron after the next election, less than two years away.",
      "In the newly reinforced Vendin-le-Vieil prison, the selected inmates will be locked in individual cells for 23 hours on most days.",
      "Largely cut off from the world, Darmanin argues they will no longer be able to fuel drug-related violence, which has become a political issue ahead of the 2027 presidential election.",
      "\u201cWe are here to guarantee that they don't speak to the outside, that they don't continue their trafficking outside, that they don't corrupt prison officers, magistrates, police officers and gendarmes,\" Darmanin said on primetime evening television after the first 17 inmates were transferred this week to Vendin-le-Vieil from other, less secure facilities.",
      "France has had a long history of both notorious prisons (the Bastille) and prisoners \u2014 both real (Napoleon) and fictional (\"The Count of Monte Cristo\").",
      "Still, Vendin-le-Vieil's lock-up conditions are exceptional, similar to the ultra-secure \u201cSupermax\u201d prison in the United States and Italy\u2019s tough \u201ccarcere duro\u201d incarceration rules for Mafia members.",
      "Vendin-le-Vieil already houses some of France's most infamous prisoners \u2014 including Salah Abdeslam, lone survivor of a team of Islamic State extremists that terrorized Paris in 2015, killing 130 people in gun and bomb attacks.",
      "To make way for the specially selected 100 inmates \u2014 some already convicted, others in pre-trial detention \u2014 many other Vendin-le-Vieil inmates were moved out. The newcomers will be grouped together in the prison's new \u201cSection for Combatting Organized Crime,\u201d with reinforced security and regulations, and equipped with systems to block mobile phone signals and drones.",
      "Among those on the list for Vendin-le-Vieil is Mohamed Amra, nicknamed \u201cThe Fly,\" who staged an escape last year that killed two guards and then fled to Romania before he was captured and returned to France.",
      "The newcomers will have just one hour a day in a prison exercise yard, in groups of no more than five. The rest of the time, they will mostly be confined to individual cells fitted with holes so prison guards can handcuff them before moving them and with ratchet systems so inmates can't yank the doors open or shut when they have to be unlocked.",
      "They will be guarded by 250 wardens \u2014 elsewhere, the ratio is usually 20 guards to 100 inmates, Darmanin told French broadcaster TF1.",
      "Instead of unlimited calls with family members from prison phones, they will be limited to a maximum of two hours, twice a week \u2014 a restriction that Darmanin says will make monitoring their conversations easier.",
      "Prison visiting rooms have also been equipped with security glass dividers, to prevent physical contact between inmates and visitors. Darmanin says this will prevent mobile phones and other contraband from being smuggled in. The new Vendin-le-Vieil inmates also won't have the rights accorded in other prisons of intimate time with partners and family members.",
      "Darmanin said the conditions will be \u201cextremely hard\" but are necessary because France risks \u201ctipping into narco-banditry\u201d in the absence of tough decisions.",

      "Brazilian coffee farmers are facing tough times after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports earlier this month",
      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",
      "Life out in the fields is tough, according to Menezes Freitas.",
      "During harvest season, he sometimes gets up at 3 a.m. to turn on a coffee drier, going to bed as late as midnight. The rest of the year is less intense, but still, there are few to no breaks because there\u2019s always work to do, he said.",

      "The European Central Bank probably isn't going to cut interest rates again on Thursday",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank will likely hold off on making another interest rate cut Thursday, choosing to wait until it can measure the size of any economic blow from higher U.S. tariffs.",
      "The ECB has already cut rates eight times since June of last year and President Christine Lagarde said after the last policy meeting June 5 that the central bank is \u201cgetting to the end of a monetary policy cycle.\" The monetary authority for the 20 countries that use the euro currency has been lowering rates to support growth after raising them in 2022-2023 to snuff out inflation caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rebound after the pandemic.",
      "With the bench mark rate now at 2%, down from a record high of 4%, analyst think there could be one more rate cut coming, but only in September.",
      "The reason, say analysts: The ECB's policymakers simply don't know the outcome of talks between the EU's executive commission and the Trump administration. Trump first set a 20% tariff for EU goods, then threatened 50% after expressing displeasure at the pace of talks, then sent the EU a letter informing officials of a potential 30% tariff. EU officials earlier held out hope of winning at least the 10% baseline that applies to almost all trade partners, and analysts think that the actual rate may be lower than Trump's tariff threats. The talks are up against an Aug. 1 deadline, but earlier deadlines have slipped as the sides kept talking.",

The 30% tariff on EU goods threatened by the US is much higher than generally expected,\u201d the UniCredit analysts wrote. \"However, the response of financial markets to US President Donald Trump\u2019s letter to the EU has been muted, and this seems to reflect expectations that the landing point for tariffs on EU goods will be materially below 30%.",

      "Growth in the eurozone was relatively strong at 0.6% in the first quarter - though that was partly due to rushed shipments of goods trying to beat the tariffs. Inflation has fallen from double digits in late 2022 to 2% in June, in line with the ECB's target. A stronger euro, which lowers the price of imports, and softer global prices for oil have helped keep inflation moderate.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Peruvian customs officials have seized a record-breaking shipment of illegal mercury, exposing a cross-border smuggling network that is fueling one of the Amazon\u2019s most destructive criminal economies: illicit gold mining.",
      "The 4-ton haul \u2014 the largest mercury seizure ever made in an Amazon country and one of the world's largest \u2014 was discovered in June at the port of Callao, hidden inside gravel-filled bags on a cargo ship bound for Bolivia. Though labeled as crushed stone, the shipment was flagged by customs agents based on international intelligence sharing.",
      "\u201cThis crushed stone was laced with mercury,\u201d said Jorge Gallo Alvarado, head of customs enforcement at SUNAT, Peru\u2019s tax and customs agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a restricted substance because it\u2019s used in illegal alluvial mining.\u201d",
      "The container, which originated in Mexico, was singled out for inspection by SUNAT\u2019s risk analysis team. U.S. specialists later confirmed the presence of mercury embedded in the gravel \u2014 a tactic increasingly used to avoid detection at ports.",
      "The seized goods are valued at roughly $500,000, SUNAT said.",
      "Authorities say the bust marks a turning point in efforts to dismantle the supply chains behind the Amazon\u2019s illicit gold trade. Mercury, a powerful neurotoxin banned or tightly restricted in many countries, remains essential to the process used by illegal miners across the rainforest to extract gold from river sediment.",
      "The method is simple but dangerous: miners mix mercury with gold particles to form an amalgam, then burn it off, releasing toxic vapor into the air. The leftover mercury often flows into rivers, where it transforms into methylmercury \u2014 its most dangerous form \u2014 and builds up in fish and aquatic life.",
      "\u201cThis is a very important seizure,\u201d said Luis Fernandez, a research professor and mercury expert at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, who traveled to Lima to assess the find.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t often see mercury seizures at this scale, especially not in transit through formal customs points,\" he said.",
      "Fernandez estimated the mercury could have been used to produce roughly 1,600 kilograms (3,527 pounds) of gold \u2014 worth more than $172 million at current prices.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t subsistence mining,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s organized, high-value illicit trade with serious environmental and public health consequences.\u201d",
      "In Peru\u2019s Madre de Dios region, an epicenter of illegal mining, mercury contamination has been detected in drinking water, fish and even breast milk. Long-term exposure to methylmercury can cause irreversible damage to the brain and nervous system, particularly in children and pregnant women. Indigenous and riverine communities that rely on fish for food are especially vulnerable.",
      "Peruvian authorities say much of the mercury entering the country is smuggled from Mexico, where it\u2019s mined in central states such as Quer\u00e9taro. Prices have surged in recent years due to booming global demand for gold, reaching as high as $330 per kilogram of mercury \u2014 and more than $3,500 per ounce of gold \u2014 earlier this year.",
      "Some of the mercury seized in June is believed to have originated in small, artisanal mines inside a UNESCO \u2011protected biosphere reserve.",
      "While the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit watchdog that investigates environmental crime, has documented that at least 30 tons of mercury have been trafficked annually from Mexico to countries like Peru and Colombia by a single criminal network, the real volume is likely higher. Soaring gold prices and a 400% markup on mercury in the Amazon compared to Mexico have made smuggling increasingly lucrative. Seizures and monitoring suggest flows rose to an estimated 56 tons in 2024, with further increases expected this year. Colombia remains one of the highest per capita emitters of mercury worldwide, with total annual releases reaching up to 150 tons, much of it tied to illegal gold mining.",
      "EIA\u2019s latest investigation, released in tandem with Peru's announcement, describes a growing \u201cgold-mercury-drug trifecta\u201d linking illegal mining to transnational crime and environmental degradation. The group\u2019s investigators documented how organized criminal groups \u2014 including Mexico\u2019s Jalisco New Generation Cartel \u2014 are now involved in mercury mining and trafficking.",

      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help",
      "NEW YORK -- After five years of working long nights as a truck driver, Julius Mosley wanted a change. He found driving unfulfilling, and his teenage son needed him to spend more time at home.",
      "So Mosley took a job as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company near his home. The employee benefits included being able to take job-related classes for free. He decided he wanted to study leadership so he could learn about managing teams and helping people become the best versions of themselves.",
      "His company, Spectrum, paid for a 10-week front-line manager certificate program that Mosley went on to complete. Then it covered the tuition cost for a bachelor's degree in leadership and organization studies that he's currently pursuing. The company also promoted him to a management position while he took college courses online.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely changed the course of my life,\u201d Mosley said about the education benefit, which took care of his tuition up front instead of requiring him to pay and seek later reimbursement. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to be able to do this.\u201d",
      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help defraying the expense of college and professional credentials. Nearly half of public and private employers have a tuition reimbursement program for employees, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, or SHRM.",
      "Many employers that provide tuition assistance reimburse staff members up to $5,250 per year because that amount is tax-deductible, said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute, which offers credentials to HR professionals.",
      "Some companies offer more, including Bank of America, which provides tuition assistance of up to $7,500 annually, and Spectrum which, in addition to its prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master's degrees or enrolled in classes that fall outside the scope of its prepaid program up to $10,000 per year.",
      "\"For companies who are looking to attract Generation Z and Millennials, it\u2019s a great way to bring them in because they\u2019re keenly interested in how companies are investing in them and the benefits that are available,\" said Dufrane.",
      "Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8% of employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according to James Atkinson, vice president of thought leadership at SHRM.",
      "If continuing education feels out of reach financially or seems incompatible with job demands, experts say there are ways to explore the possibility, either by by making the case to your employer or seeking a position at a place that provides education benefits.",
      "In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees lay out thousands of dollars to pay for tuition, books and fees at the start of a semester, and usually must complete the course with a passing grade before a company would kick in its contribution.",
      "That means employees would often wait four to six months before being reimbursed, which only works for more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer at Spectrum.",
      "\u201cThe person that can afford to put it on their credit card and sit with $3- or $4- or $5,000 of expenses due back to them and not be concerned about that cost, that is not our average worker,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOur average worker is making $25, $28, $30 bucks an hour, maybe having a second job, maybe a single parent with kids, ... and they\u2019re important workers for us, and we want to help develop them and grow their careers.\u201d",
      "Spectrum launched a program that lets employees sign up for an array of certificates or college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses and where to take them came from Guild, a Denver company that works with employers on workforce development and tuition assistance.",
      "Walmart offers a similar benefit to its front-line associates, who can enroll in college or certain classes without ever seeing an invoice, according to company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends to family members of the employees, he said.",
      "As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs as well as tuition assistance.",

      "\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m now ahead of where I thought I would be a little over a year ago is very nice to see,\u201d she said.",
      "Not all employers offer education benefits, and when they do, they're not always widely publicized. To find out if your employer offers such benefits, ask a manager or a human resources representative.",
      "Show how a course or training directly relates to your role and how it would help you do your job more effectively, Dufrane advised. Even if there's no formal tuition reimbursement program, your employer might have a training or professional development budget.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re taking on a stretch role or entering a new industry, you can advocate for training as part of your offer. Say something like, \u2018I\u2019d like to take a course to help me get up to speed in this area.\u2019 In my experience, that shows initiative and employers often respect it,\u201d Dufrane said.",

To manage his time, he switched to working Monday through Thursday, studied on weeknights and dedicated Friday through Sunday to other schoolwork.",
      "\u201cWithout the tuition reimbursement or the organization\u2019s flexibility, there\u2019s no way that I would be able to\u201d earn advanced degrees, said Sotolongo, who is now pursuing a PhD with assistance from HRCI. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding in every aspect.\u201d",
      "Providing flexibility shows commitment to employees, Dufrane said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be flexible around learning because people have parents they\u2019re taking care of and kids they're taking care of, and going home at night isn\u2019t always the best time to be writing a paper,\u201d she said.",
      "Fitting in schoolwork while also meeting the needs of a son, a fiancee, a full-time job and a puppy has been challenging for Mosley, but it also provided a way to model studious behavior for his son.",
      "\u201cInstead of me just telling him he needs to do his, now he\u2019s seeing me doing schoolwork, so that actually helped out with him wanting to do his work more,\" Mosley said. \"We actually take time to sit down together some days to work on our homework, so it\u2019s been a life-changing situation.\u201d",

      "Warner Music Group has announced that it's reissuing the lone album recorded by Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham when they were just a duo",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- They were in love once.",
      "Four years before Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d became one of the best breakup records of the 1970s \u2014 and, many might say, all time \u2014 Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were relative unknowns, a young couple putting out their own album, posing nude on the cover like a Laurel Canyon version of Adam and Eve.",
      "Released as \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d the 1973 album has for decades maintained somewhat of a holy grail status in the dusty bins of record stores, selling for $20 to $90 depending on its condition. Now, in addition to new vinyl, it will be available on streaming and CD for the first time when it's reissued Sept. 19 on Rhino, Warner Music Group announced Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's one of those records that everybody has heard of but not that many people have actually heard,\u201d said Brian Mansfield, a music historian, journalist and record collector in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cEspecially before everything got put onto YouTube, very few people had heard it because it had never been on CD. But it had this iconic cover that everybody recognized.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d featured the duo's iconic harmonies and Buckingham's distinct guitar sound, which later fueled Fleetwood Mac's ability to sell tens of millions of records. But \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d bombed upon release and Polydor dropped them from the label, prompting Nicks' return to waitressing and Buckingham to briefly tour with Don Everly.",
      "The rest of the story is enshrined in lore: Drummer Mick Fleetwood heard \u201cFrozen Love\u201d from the album when he visited the studio where it was recorded, Sound City. After guitarist Bob Welch left the band, Fleetwood invited Buckingham to Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham insisting Nicks join too. The band also included the late Christine McVie on keyboards and John McVie on bass.",
      "Generations of avid Fleetwood Mac fans have tattooed their lyrics or analyzed them at a forensic level, enshrining the tumultuous relationship between Buckingham and Nicks in pop culture. The upcoming reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d is a reminder of the couple's musical beginnings and the special status their only joint album has held among fans and record collectors.",
      "\u201cAs soon as we put it out, it goes that day,\u201d said Michael Bell, owner of Hunky Dory Records, which has locations in Raleigh, Durham and Cary, North Carolina.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham met during high school at a local church in Northern California where young musicians gathered on a school night, according to Stephen Davis' \u201cGold Dust Woman: The Biography of Stevie Nicks.\u201d",
      "Buckingham played the Mamas & the Papas' \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\" on piano, prompting Nicks to chime in, singing Michelle Phillips\u2019 high harmony.",
      "\u201cThey glanced at each other; she noticed his eyes, cold blue like lake ice,\" Davis wrote. \"They sang the whole song while the room went quiet, everyone mesmerized.\u201d",
      "After high school, Nicks joined the band Buckingham was in, Fritz, which would open for Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. They eventually split off as a duo, started dating and moved to Los Angeles.",
      "Nicks said she loved Buckingham before he was a millionaire, according to Davis' book, and \u201cwashed his jeans and embroidered stupid moons and stars on the bottom of them.\u201d",
      "The first track on \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d \u201cCrying in the Night,\" has \u201ca sense of Joni Mitchell fronting the Eagles,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cFrozen Love\u201d closed out side two, with \u201clayers of strings and synthesizers and a major Lindsey Buckingham rock guitar symphony.\"",
      "\u201cNo one seemed to like the record,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cPolydor executives hadn\u2019t even wanted to release it.\"",
      "A review that ran in The Pittsburgh Press said Nicks and Buckingham produced \"a pleasant, albeit a whiny vocal blend on some pretty fair songs.\u201d",

      "\u201cRumours\u201d came two years later.",
      "Bob Fuchs, retail manager of record store Electric Fetus in Minneapolis, said the shop gets in about two to four of the original vinyl a year. Those go on on its collectible wall that showcases hard-to-find titles. Depending on its condition, the album sells for between $40 to $90, he said.",
      "\u201cYou put it up on a Saturday morning and it\u2019s gone by Saturday at noon. So it lasts about two hours,\u201d he said.",
      "Fuchs never bought the album himself because, \u201cevery time I came in, it was $60 or $80. ... So I\u2019ll probably end up picking up a reissue.\u201d",
      "Across the river at the St. Paul, Minnesota, location of Cheapo Discs, though, worker Geoff Good said people rarely came in looking for the original. He does expect the reissue to juice sales. He has the original, which he bought in 1974 or 1975, in his own collection.",
      "\u201cThe songwriting is really good, the harmonies are good, Lindsey Buckingham is an amazing guitar player,\u201d he said.",
      "Mansfield, the Nashville historian, randomly found a copy two weeks ago in a neighborhood garage sale, just days prior to hints that a reissue was coming.",
      "He has no idea why \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d hasn't been reissued more considering the steady demand. For him, it's a good album but not one that reached the heights of what was to come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything on this album that would have made a Fleetwood album.\u201d",
      "The romantic relationship between Buckingham and Nicks would end around the making of \u201cRumours.\u201d Nicks and Buckingham would shoot eye daggers at each other onstage in packed stadiums, while Buckingham would roll his eyes during Nicks' MusiCares speech in 2018, according to the Los Angeles Times. Buckingham would eventually be kicked off the band's tour in 2018 , prompting a lawsuit that was later settled.",
      "But this month, Buckingham and Nicks seemed to be operating in perfect symmetry \u2014 at least on Instagram. Each posted half a line from \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d \u2014 with Nicks writing \"And if you go forward\u2026\u201d and Buckingham responding, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d On Wednesday, they shared the same video of a billboard being put up to advertise the reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "They may have made the album more than 50 years ago, Buckingham said in announcing its reissue, \u201cbut it stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\u201d",

      "Brazilian coffee farmers are facing tough times after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports earlier this month",
      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Da Silva, who wore a straw hat for protection from the sun and a crucifix around his neck, owns around 40,000 coffee trees. He started working in the fields when he was 12.",
      "Besides coffee, he grows cassava, squash, bananas, oranges and lemons and has a few chickens that provide fresh eggs. \u201cWe have them because of the fear of not being able to eat. We wouldn\u2019t manage if everything were bought, because the profit is very low,\u201d he said.",
      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",
      "Life out in the fields is tough, according to Menezes Freitas.",
      "During harvest season, he sometimes gets up at 3 a.m. to turn on a coffee drier, going to bed as late as midnight. The rest of the year is less intense, but still, there are few to no breaks because there\u2019s always work to do, he said.",
      "Menezes Freitas, who is expecting his first child in October, said the tariff\u2019s announcement increased his fears for the future.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary. It feels like you\u2019re on shaky ground. If things get worse, what will we do? People will start pulling out their coffee and finding other ways to survive because they won\u2019t have the means to continue,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to slashing the value of his coffee beans, Menezes Freitas said the tariff will impact machinery and aluminum \u2014 goods that producers like him use every day.",
      "\u201cWe hope this calms down. Hopefully, they\u2019ll come to their senses and remove that tariff. I think it would be better for both the United States and Brazil,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife, Angela, are longtime owners of a $1.5 million home in a Dallas suburb",
      "WASHINGTON -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife, Angela, are longtime owners of a $1.5 million house in a gated community outside Dallas. In 2015, they snapped up a second home in Austin. Then another.",
      "The problem: Mortgages signed by the Paxtons contained inaccurate statements declaring that each of those three houses was their primary residence, enabling the now-estranged couple to improperly lock in low interest rates, according to an Associated Press review of public records. The lower rates will save the Paxtons tens of thousands of dollars in payments over the life of the loan, legal experts say.",
      "The records also revealed that the Paxtons collected an impermissible homestead tax break on two of those homes, and they have routinely flouted lending agreements on some of their other properties.",
      "It is a federal and state crime to knowingly make false statements on mortgage documents. It's also against the law in Texas to collect a homestead tax break on two separate properties. Violating the terms of a mortgage could allow lenders recourse to seek full payment of a loan, according to legal experts.",
      "The mortgage revelations are likely to become fodder in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in which Paxton is seeking to topple the incumbent, John Cornyn. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's criminal pursuit of Democrats over similar issues.",
      "President Donald Trump has accused two of his political foes \u2014 Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 of committing mortgage fraud, though legal experts say the circumstances are less serious.",
      "The Democrats have long been objects of Trump\u2019s ire for having led various investigations into his conduct as president and as a business executive.",
      "Paxton, himself, has weighed in on the investigation of James, saying he hoped authorities would look into her conduct. \u201cI hope that if she\u2019s done something wrong, I hope that she\u2019s actually held accountable,\u201d he told supporters last month.",
      "The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation of James, FBI director Kash Patel told Fox News in May. The department received a criminal referral for Schiff last week from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, its director William Pulte confirmed in a social media post.",
      "Neither the Justice Department nor the FHFA responded to an inquiry about whether they may investigate Paxton, too.",
      "James\u2019 attorney, Abbe Lowell, urged the Trump administration to investigate Paxton instead.",
      "\u201cIf this administration was genuinely interested in rooting out fraud, it appears they should stop wasting their time on the baseless and discredited allegations against the New York Attorney General James and turn their attention to Texas,\u201d said Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney whose past clients include Hunter Biden, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.",
      "In a statement, Marisol Samayoa, a Schiff spokeswoman, blasted the criminal referral as \u201ca transparent attempt\u201d by Trump \u201cto punish a perceived political foe who is committed to holding him to account.\u201d She added that Schiff disclosed to his lenders that he owned another home that was a principal residence and sought guidance from an attorney.",
      "It is unlikely that Paxton, a staunch Trump ally, will face the same federal scrutiny as James and Schiff. It\u2019s equally doubtful that Paxton will face much legal trouble in Texas: His office is one of the primary agencies tasked with investigating allegations of mortgage fraud.",
      "Ken Paxton and his spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Angela Paxton, who is a state senator in Texas, did not respond to requests made through her office.",
      "Documents reviewed by the AP show the Paxtons hold mortgages on three homes \u2014 one in suburban Dallas, two in Austin \u2014 that are each listed as their primary residence. The designation comes with a considerable financial upside.",
      "Interest rates on primary homes are significantly lower than those for mortgages on secondary homes or investment properties, saving buyers tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 if not more \u2014 over the life of a loan.",
      "Making a case against Paxton would require \"establishing both that Paxton was aware of the contents of the mortgage document, and also that he was actively aware at the time that he signed it that this was not going to be a primary residence,\u201d said Jennifer E. Laurin, a professor at the University of Texas Law School in Austin.",
      "Legal experts say it is possible that the Paxtons\u2019 lenders prepared the documents and that the couple did not carefully review them before signing.",
      "Even if that were the case, some legal experts say that Paxton, as an attorney and Texas\u2019 top law enforcement officer, ought to have known better.",
      "\u201cIf he filled out lender documents knowing that they were false, then that is a false statement to obtain a mortgage on favorable terms. That would be actionable,\u201d said Arif Lawji, a veteran Texas real estate attorney. \u201cHe\u2019s the chief enforcement officer. You have to be accountable for stuff you do that\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

      "Low interest rates are not the only perk the Paxtons secured, records show. In 2018, they simultaneously collected homestead property tax breaks on their family\u2019s home in suburban Dallas, as well as on a $1.1 million home in Austin, property records and tax statements show.",
      "A homestead tax break is a property tax reduction that a homeowner is only eligible to collect on one property that is also their primary home.",
      "The suburban Dallas home is where the Paxtons\u2019 family has long resided. It\u2019s where Ken and Angela Paxton are registered to vote. It is located in the state Senate district that Angela Paxton represents in the Legislature, which Ken Paxton held before his election in 2014 to be attorney general. It\u2019s also where Ken Paxton\u2019s Senate campaign website until recently said he lived.",
      "Lawji said the Paxtons\u2019 simultaneous collection of two homestead tax breaks appears to be a more clearcut violation. That is because one must obtain a form and submit it to taxing authorities to receive such a tax break, making it an \u201cintentional act,\u201d he said.",
      "The tax break was worth several thousand dollars, a fact that confounded real estate lawyers. \u201cWhy would you try to do all of this,\u201d Lawji said, \u201cwhen you are the attorney general? That\u2019s a bigger question to me than the money, when you are AG and have to enforce this law.\u201d",
      "Separately, land records indicate the Paxtons may have violated the terms of at least two mortgages on other houses they own. The mortgage on a home in College Station, Texas, says the property is for the Paxtons\u2019 exclusive use and cannot be rented out. Doing so would be grounds for terminating the mortgage, the document states. The home has been listed for rent on real estate websites on-and-off since at least 2022.",
      "Ken Paxton also holds a $1.2 million mortgage on a \u201c5 bedroom luxury cabin\u201d in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, that is for rent on Airbnb and other short-term rental sites, records show. The property\u2019s mortgage stipulates that it cannot be rented out.",
      "Representatives for Stifel Bank, Cornerstone Home Lending and Benchmark Mortgage, which issued the mortgages in question, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are in many ways distinct from those of James and Schiff, the Democrats targeted by the Trump administration.",
      "The investigation of James centers on forms she signed in 2023 while helping a niece buy a home in Virginia. One form stated that James intended to occupy the home as her \u201cprincipal residence.\u201d But in other documents, the New York attorney general made clear she had no intention of living there. An email to the mortgage loan broker two weeks before she signed the documents stated the property \u201cWILL NOT be my primary residence.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve said from the beginning, if prosecutors want to know that truth about Attorney General James\u2019 mortgage applications, we are ready and waiting with the facts,\u201d said Lowell, James\u2019 attorney.",
      "For over a decade, Schiff owned homes in Maryland and California, the state he represents, that were both designated as his primary residence. In 2020, then a congressman, Schiff designated his Maryland property as a second home \u2014 a step Paxton has not taken.",
      "Paxton\u2019s real estate dealings are not the first time he has drawn scrutiny for his conduct while in office.",
      "Before his election as attorney general, Paxton, then a state senator, admitted in 2014 to violating Texas securities law and paid a fine.",
      "He spent roughly 10 years under state indictment on securities charges while serving as attorney general. The charges were eventually dropped in 2024. Other alleged misdeeds in office led to his impeachment by Texas\u2019 GOP-controlled House in 2023. He was acquitted in a trial by the Senate.",
      "Angela Paxton did not cast a vote in his impeachment trial and recently filed for divorce, citing Ken Paxton\u2019s infidelity and other \u201crecent discoveries.\u201d She did not elaborate.",
      "What ultimately unleashed the impeachment push was Paxton\u2019s relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, who pleaded guilty this year to one count of making a false statement to a financial institution.",

      "Britain said the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds ($35 billion) annually from 2040 and add almost 5 billion pounds ($6.8 billion) a year to the British economy.",

      "The European Central Bank probably isn't going to cut interest rates again on Thursday",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank will likely hold off on making another interest rate cut Thursday, choosing to wait until it can measure the size of any economic blow from higher U.S. tariffs.",
      "The ECB has already cut rates eight times since June of last year and President Christine Lagarde said after the last policy meeting June 5 that the central bank is \u201cgetting to the end of a monetary policy cycle.\" The monetary authority for the 20 countries that use the euro currency has been lowering rates to support growth after raising them in 2022-2023 to snuff out inflation caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rebound after the pandemic.",
      "With the bench mark rate now at 2%, down from a record high of 4%, analyst think there could be one more rate cut coming, but only in September.",
      "The reason, say analysts: The ECB's policymakers simply don't know the outcome of talks between the EU's executive commission and the Trump administration. Trump first set a 20% tariff for EU goods, then threatened 50% after expressing displeasure at the pace of talks, then sent the EU a letter informing officials of a potential 30% tariff. EU officials earlier held out hope of winning at least the 10% baseline that applies to almost all trade partners, and analysts think that the actual rate may be lower than Trump's tariff threats. The talks are up against an Aug. 1 deadline, but earlier deadlines have slipped as the sides kept talking.",
      "The decision to hold rates unchanged will be \u201cuncontroversial\u201d among members of the bank's rate-setting council, said analysts at UniCredit's Investment Institute.",
      "\u201cIn light of recent events, the risk of an adverse tariff scenario has increased since the June ECB meeting. The 30% tariff on EU goods threatened by the US is much higher than generally expected,\u201d the UniCredit analysts wrote. \"However, the response of financial markets to US President Donald Trump\u2019s letter to the EU has been muted, and this seems to reflect expectations that the landing point for tariffs on EU goods will be materially below 30%.",

      "Growth in the eurozone was relatively strong at 0.6% in the first quarter - though that was partly due to rushed shipments of goods trying to beat the tariffs. Inflation has fallen from double digits in late 2022 to 2% in June, in line with the ECB's target. A stronger euro, which lowers the price of imports, and softer global prices for oil have helped keep inflation moderate.",
      "The stronger euro, up 13% this year at $1.17, has attracted attention as a potential damper on growth and ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said any rapid moves over $1.20 could be \u201cmuch more complicated.\u201d But the ECB typically does not target the exchange rate, and the euro's rise is considered to be less the result of Europe's strength and more the result of a weaker dollar weighed down by investor uncertainty about the future path of inflation, growth and government debt in the US.",

      "B\u00e1nfalvi\u2019s company has been shipping around 10,000 bottles of premium Hungarian wine per year to the U.S. for about half a decade. With a base in Washington D.C., it exports a range of red and white wines to clients in numerous U.S. states including specialty wine shops and bars.",

      "When Trump began imposing tariffs on EU exports earlier this year, the cost of Taste Hungary\u2019s shipments tripled, B\u00e1nfalvi said \u2014 price hikes he had to build into the sticker price of the wine. The imposition of 30% tariffs would make exporting \u201cunsustainable.\u201d",

In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%.

      "Nonprofits in the Bronx are facing severe challenges as federal grant cuts disrupt essential services",
      "NEW YORK -- On a sweltering summer day, children leap between rocks along the Bronx River while cyclists pedal on newly paved paths. Kayaks rest on what was once an industrial dumping ground, now transformed into a bustling promenade along the city\u2019s only freshwater river.",
      "The Bronx River Greenway, a series of stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned and polluted wasteland, is a hard-fought victory for the country\u2019s poorest congressional district \u2014 one that locals call a \u201cbeacon of environmental justice\u201d built by federal dollars and water-pollution settlements from the borough\u2019s wealthier neighbors.",
      "Now, like thousands of nonprofits around the country, this organization\u2019s future is in jeopardy. The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide and the communities they serve in precarious straits. But few places face as stark a reckoning as the Bronx, where federal funding has proved indispensable for revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and preventing youth violence.",
      "Over 84% of the 342 nonprofits based in the Bronx rely on federal grants now at risk, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It\u2019s a significant increase from the 70% of groups vulnerable to government defunding statewide.",
      "In all but two of the country\u2019s 437 congressional districts, the typical nonprofit could not cover its expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served as contractors for government services \u2014 like operating homeless shelters \u2014 since the 1960s.",
      "In the Bronx, if such grants were to disappear entirely, the borough\u2019s nonprofits could face a collective deficit of nearly 30% \u2014 cuts that have begun to force layoffs and austerity on dozens of groups connecting Bronxites to low-cost health care, food assistance, and preschool slots.",
      "\u201cWhen America sneezes, the Bronx gets the flu,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, the Democrat who represents the district. \u201cI think we in the Bronx feel we have been and will continue to be the hardest hit by the impact of a Trump presidency.\u201d",
      "Nestled in a corner of parkland atop the site of an abandoned amusement park, the headquarters of the Bronx River Alliance is among the borough\u2019s greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples of the river\u2019s flora and fauna, and a storage space teeming with kayaks and canoes.",
      "In March, the group received formal notice that it would lose $1.5 million in federal grants promised under the Inflation Reduction Act last year for improving water quality and climate-resilience projects. After years of rising momentum, cubicles now sit empty. Leaders held off on hiring in anticipation of cuts, and now they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to fill those roles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met some of the folks who were pulling cars out of the river in the \u201970s and \u201980s,\u201d said Daniel Ranells, the group\u2019s deputy director of programs. Back then, the area was a \u201cdumping ground\u201d so inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens, and microwaves that \u201cfolks didn\u2019t really understand there was a river there.\u201d",
      "That has shifted dramatically in recent years thanks in part to decades of federal investment. Just south of its headquarters, the organization restored salt marshes along the riverbanks of a shuttered concrete plant.",
      "In 2007, the first beaver appeared on the Bronx River in over 200 years \u2014 named \u201cJos\u00e9 the Beaver\u201d in honor of former Congressman Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who helped direct millions in federal funds to groups dedicated to the river\u2019s restoration.",

      "Now staffers at the Bronx River Alliance describe a sense of \u201cwhiplash\u201d in seeing hard-fought funds dry up and grant language scrubbed of any allusions to racial or environmental justice.",
      "The Bronx River Alliance has joined other nonprofits in suing the Trump administration to unfreeze funds, but the uncertainty has already disrupted years of planning, a reality that has rippled across the neighborhood, leaving few organizations untouched.",
      "Up the street from the Alliance, the office of the Osborne Association, a group that has worked to prevent youth violence for nearly a century, has grown quieter. In April, an email from the Bureau of Justice Assistance stated the remaining $666,000 of a $2 million grant \u201cno longer effectuates department priorities.\u201d",

      "The cut thrust the nonprofit into \u201ctriage mode,\u201d said Osborne president Jonathan Monsalve, who was forced to lay off three staffers and reduce the number of participants in a diversion program offering young adults facing gun charges an alternative to jail time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for young people, and it\u2019s no longer there for 25 more of them,\u201d Monsalve said. \u201cWithout another alternative, it\u2019s 25 young people that will see prison or jail time, and that\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has canceled over $810 million in similar grants to nonprofits working in violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to cancel $2 billion in grants for environmental justice work.",
      "Nonprofit leaders say the cuts hit hardest in the places that can afford them the least. In the Bronx, almost 30 percent of residents live in poverty, the vast majority of whom are Black or Latino, and nearly one in six schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of disinvestment in these communities, and we had been starting to see some meaningful investment and community-based solutions that were actually working,\u201d said Monsalve. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden that support just gets yanked away.\u201d",
      "The federal government, he said, is essentially telling these communities: \u201cYou aren\u2019t a priority anymore. You don\u2019t fit the plan.\u201d",
      "For decades, a million-dollar federal grant allowed the victim-service organization Safe Horizon to operate a program that stationed domestic violence advocates in the borough\u2019s criminal court.",

      "It was an agonizing decision given the volume of domestic violence in the Bronx, Roberts said.",
      "It means that hundreds of survivors \u201cmay not have the opportunity to talk to an advocate about their options, about their rights, or about their safety,\u201d she said.",
      "Roberts said she\u2019s bracing for more cuts \u2014 federal funds make up about 24% of the group\u2019s budget \u2014 that could force the closure of shelters or reductions to a citywide hotline.",
      "As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy and local governments will need to \u201cmake some smart and thoughtful and principled decisions about where they can help to fill those gaps.\u201d",
      "In places like the Bronx, finding alternative funding is especially challenging. \u201cThe not-for-profit sector is often fragile, and nowhere more so than the Bronx,\u201d Torres said of the district he represents, where organizations tend to be more dependent on government funding than wealthier enclaves.",
      "\u201cOrganizations spent hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to apply for a contract and hired staff and made all these plans only to see the written contract disappear,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply destabilizing.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says a trip to China may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a trip to China might be \u201cnot too distant,\u201d raising prospects that the leaders of the world's two largest economies may meet soon to help reset relations after moving to climb down from a trade war.",
      "Trump made the remarks while hosting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House, where he praised the \u201cfantastic military relationship\u201d with Manila as the U.S. looks to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "Yet, Trump still said the U.S. is \u201cgetting along with China very well. We have a very good relationship.\" He added that Beijing has resumed shipping to the U.S. \u201crecord numbers\u201d of much-needed rare earth magnets, which are used in iPhones and other high-tech products like electric vehicles.",
      "Widely speculated about since Trump returned to the White House, a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be expected to stabilize \u2014 even for a short while \u2014 a difficult relationship defined by mistrust and competition.",
      "Beijing believes a leader-level summit is necessary to steady U.S.-China relations and that Trump must be wooed because he has the final say on America's policy toward China, despite more hawkish voices in his Cabinet, observers say.",
      "The question, however, is when.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Trump has consistently shown his hunger for a visit to China and that Beijing has used that to bolster leverage.",
      "\u201cAs soon as the leadership in Beijing is satisfied that Trump will be on his best behavior and will accept terms for a deal that they think are favorable, they will give a green light to the visit,\u201d Russel said.",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, said a visit \u201cis in the making\u201d with two sides likely to strike a trade deal.",
      "What Trump said might mean the visit would not be in September but \"potentially November, but still depends on whether they play ball on trade and other things we want,\" Sun said.",
      "Trump's campaign to impose tariffs on other countries kicked off a high-stake trade war with Beijing. China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% in response to Trump's hiking the tax on Chinese goods to 145%.",
      "Both sides also imposed on each other harsh trade restrictions on critical products: China on rare earths, and the U.S. on computing chips and jet engine technology.",

      "Like what the New York Giants did this offseason",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Like what the New York Giants did this offseason? Thank Malik Nabers.",
      "No, the wide receiver coming off an impressive rookie year didn\u2019t add co-general manager with Joe Schoen to his responsibilities. But Nabers did give coach Brian Daboll some input during a busy spring that included signing quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston, trading up to take Jaxson Dart late in the first round and also drafting running back Cam Skattebo.",
      "\u201cI think Dabes did a great job of asking me questions about making moves, and me and him were in contact about moves to be made,\u201d Nabers said. \u201cThat was a great job of him reaching out to the players about things that we were missing that we want.\u201d",
      "On defense, New York got a potential difference maker in edge rusher Abdul Carter with the third pick and filled some holes in the secondary in free agency by signing cornerback Paulson Adebo and safety Jevon Holland. Daboll mentioned Brian Burns and Dexter Lawrence among the other players he talks to about additions.",
      "Nabers did not have much to say for the other side of the ball. Offensively, where the Giants ranked third-worst in the league last season, he was happy to share his thoughts.",
      "\u201cHe was really telling me: \u2018How do you like this decision? How do you like this decision?\u2019\u201d Nabers said. \u201cHe was able to ask me questions like that because he knew I was going to give great feedback. Having that as a head coach to come to a rookie player to decide on what decisions to be made with the team next year, I feel like it shows the confidence that he has in me, the confidence that the organization has in me and I\u2019m hoping that we made some of the great decisions to be made.\u201d",
      "While Nabers turns 22 next week and is just one season into his professional career, having Daboll's ear did not happen by accident. The two started building a relationship at their first training camp together last year when Nabers wasn't shy about speaking up despite his lack of experience.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a smart player,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cI\u2019m close with him. And I think those relationships with all your players are important \u2014 and particularly ones that play like Malik.\u201d",
      "Nabers caught 109 passes for 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns \u2014 from four different quarterbacks \u2014 as a rookie. Only one (now fourth-stringer Tommy DeVito) is back, with Wilson opening as the starter, Dart waiting in the wings and Winston around as a reliable backup.",

      "ATLANTA -- Justin Verlander ended the longest streak of starts in a season without a win in Giants history, Rafael Devers drove in four runs with three hits, including two home runs, and San Francisco beat the Atlanta Braves 9-3 on Wednesday.",
      "The 42-year-old Verlander (1-8) had been winless in his first 16 starts, the longest stretch by a Giants pitcher in a single season in franchise history. The three-time Cy Young winner, who finalized a $15 million, one-year deal with San Francisco in January, allowed one hit in five scoreless innings and overcame five walks.",
      "Devers went deep off Spencer Strider (4-8) in the fifth for the game's first run. Strider then hit Willy Adames with a pitch before Matt Chapman's two-run homer gave San Francisco a 3-0 lead. Devers added a three-run shot off Dylan Dodd, who was recalled earlier in the day, in the sixth.",
      "Devers served as the designated hitter, one day after making his debut as the starting first baseman in Tuesday night\u2019s 9-0 win, which ended the team\u2019s six-game losing streak.",
      "Eli White\u2019s blooper landed fair near the right-field line to open the fifth for Atlanta's first hit off Verlander. White stole second base and moved to third on a wild pitch before Verlander struck out Drake Baldwin to end the inning.",
      "The Giants outscored the Braves 18-3 to win the final two games of the series after Atlanta won the opener 9-7.",

      "In the moment, it didn\u2019t matter to him that he\u2019d gotten there thanks to a call of catcher\u2019s interference.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, this feels exactly like a home run,\u201d Sosa said through a translator. \u201cThe most important thing about it is that we end up winning the game, and that\u2019s what we went out to do.\u201d",
      "Sosa won the game when, with the bases loaded and no out in the 10th inning, his check swing on a 2-2 pitch struck the glove of catcher Carlos Narvaez. The Phillies dugout called for a review, which showed the contact, allowing Sosa to take first and automatic runner Brandon Marsh to score the winning run.",
      "\u201cI felt my barrel was a little late on the pitch,\u201d said Sosa, who entered as a pinch-hitter in the eighth and singled. \u201cAnd as I go through my swing path, I feel like I hit the catcher\u2019s glove. And I told the ump that I think I felt something, and I started signaling in the dugout.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the first instance of a walk-off catcher\u2019s interference in a major league game since Aug. 1, 1971, when the Los Angeles Dodgers won on a call against Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench. Willie Crawford was the batter, Joe Gibbon the pitcher.",
      "The play went down as an error for Narvaez, his sixth of the season, second-most among catchers in the majors. Narvaez also had a passed ball, his fifth, in the fourth inning that moved Nick Castellanos into scoring position after he drove in the Phillies\u2019 first run. Castellanos scored on J.T. Realmuto\u2019s single.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel I was that close to the hitter,\u201d Narvaez said. \u201cEverything went so quick. Really tough for that to happen in that moment to cost us the game. I take accountability. I\u2019ve got to be better. That cannot happen.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the Phillies\u2019 third walk-off win of the season. The first, against Washington on April 29, came on a wild pitch that allowed Bryson Stott to score. A walk-off on June 6 over the Chicago Cubs came via a Marsh single in the 11th.",

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",

      "Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens",
      "As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens.",
      "\u201cTokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,\u201d said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France.",
      "Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors.",
      "But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century\u2019s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",
      "The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast.",
      "She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television.",
      "\u201cYou used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,\u201d Haun said. \u201cYou tune in at a specific time, you don\u2019t get to choose your program, you couldn\u2019t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.\u201d",
      "Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.",
      "Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",

      "\u201cWhich is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,\u201d Reiners said.",
      "Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday.",

    "story": [
      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",

      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",
      "\u201cHopefully, even if such research is defunded in the U.S., such research will continue in Europe and China, preventing these extreme scenarios,\u201d said Harrison.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

      "A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overruled a decision by a federal district judge to block the 2024 law from going into effect. It's the latest legal development as court challenges play out against similar laws in states across the country.",
      "Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the new laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.",
      "Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch argued in a court filing defending the law that steps such as age verification for digital sites could mitigate harm caused by \u201csex trafficking, sexual abuse, child pornography, targeted harassment, sextortion, incitement to suicide and self-harm, and other harmful and often illegal conduct against children.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for NetChoice, which brought the lawsuit, have pledged to continue their court challenge, arguing the law threatens privacy rights and unconstitutionally restricts the free expression of users of all ages.",

Claims can still be filed over manufacturing defects. The law hasn't yet been incorporated into the case.",

      "A judge has scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the beating death of Tyre Nichols",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A judge on Thursday scheduled sentencings in December for five former Memphis police officers convicted of federal charges in the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols, after the sentencings were delayed when the previous judge in the case surprisingly recused himself.",
      "During a hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman said the five officers would be sentenced the week of Dec. 15. However, she noted those dates could change or be canceled depending on how she rules on several sealed motions, including one for a new trial for three of the men.",
      "Lipman said she could rule on the pending motions by mid-September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Mark Norris issued a terse order on June 13 saying he was recusing himself, just days before he was supposed to sentence the officers. He offered no further explanation, and the reason for his recusal has not been made public. Lipman was added to the case the same day.",
      "Norris later recused himself from a $550 million lawsuit filed by Nichols' mother against the city of Memphis, the police chief and the officers. Lipman also took over that case.",
      "Norris had overseen the case since federal indictments were issued in September 2023. He accepted guilty pleas from two of the officers and presided over the trial for the others in October.",
      "A flurry of motions were filed under seal after the recusal, including a request by defense attorneys seeking a new trial. It was not clear if any of those filings asked for Norris to step away from the case. It is unusual for a judge to recuse themself from a case between the trial and sentencing.",
      "The city of Memphis and its police chief, and the Daily Memphian news outlet, have filed motions to unseal the documents.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, the officers yanked Nichols from his car, then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place just steps from his home.",
      "Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023.",
      "Footage of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries \u2014 video that prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis.",

      "The beating also sparked nationwide protests and prompted renewed calls for police reform. The five officers \u2014 Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin, Desmond Mills Jr., and Justin Smith \u2014 were fired from the police force and indicted in state and federal court.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were found guilty in federal court in October of obstruction of justice through witness tampering related to an attempt to cover up the beating.",
      "The officers failed to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke Memphis Police Department rules when they did not include complete and accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges by the federal jury. Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs. He was also convicted of conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted in May of all state charges, including second-degree murder.",
      "Martin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court with their former colleagues. Martin and Mills also avoided the trial in state court after reaching agreements to plead guilty there. Both Martin and Mills testified in the federal trial, and Mills also took the stand in the state trial.",
      "The officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded weeks after Nichols died. The team targeted illegal drugs and guns and violent offenders, and sometimes used force against unarmed people.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people. The investigation also found that the police department conducts unlawful stops, searches, and arrests.",
      "In May, the Trump administration announced it was retracting the findings of Justice Department civil rights investigations of police departments, including Memphis, that were issued under the Biden administration.",
      "The city has created a task force to address police department reforms. The task force has not announced any recommendations.",

      "Nash Keen was born on July 5, 2024 \u2014 133 days earlier than the expected due date and weighing only 10 ounces (283 grams) -- about the size of a bar of soap. He spent the next six months in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Health Care Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital before he was allowed in January to go home to Ankeny, Iowa, with parents Mollie and Randall Keen.",
      "\u201cNash is so full of personality. He\u2019s a happy baby,\u201d Mollie Keen said Wednesday, adding that he's slept through most nights since coming home from the NICU. \u201cBeing in the NICU as long as he was, you\u2019d think that he would be, you know, more fragile and stuff. And he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a very determined, curious little boy, and he\u2019s just all smiles all the time.\u201d",
      "Nash is among the growing number of extremely premature infants who are getting lifesaving treatment and surviving. Upon reaching his first birthday, Guinness World Records declared Nash the world's most premature baby, beating out by a single day the organization's previous record holder born in 2020 in Alabama.",
      "Nash's parents had already experienced the heartbreak of losing a baby when Mollie's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. That's when she learned of a medical condition she had that might make it difficult for her to carry to full term.",
      "Mollie worried she and her husband might lose Nash, too, when she learned at her 20-week prenatal checkup that she was already 2 centimeters dilated. Doctors don't typically try to perform lifesaving measures for babies born before 22 weeks gestation as most born that young can't survive. But Mollie learned the neonatal team at Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital was performing lifesaving measures on babies born at 21 weeks gestation. She went into labor days before that benchmark, but with medical help, she was able to stall the birth to exactly 21 weeks.",
      "The next month was fraught with medical scares as an entire team of doctor's worked to keep Nash alive and thriving.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I noticed about the medical team is that they were very calm,\u201d she recalled. \u201cYou never really saw them, like, get anxious or anything. And so we kind of just learned to, like, watch them. And if, you know, if the doctors and the nurses weren\u2019t freaking out, there was no reason for us to freak out.\u201d",

      "Ryan Routh previously made the request earlier this month during a hearing in Fort Pierce before U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon. She did not rule during the hearing but said she would issue a written order later. But now Routh, 59, is set to be back in front of Cannon, a day after his court-appointed federal public defenders asked to be taken off the case.",
      "Routh is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot Trump as he played golf. Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "The judge told Routh earlier this month that she doesn\u2019t intend to delay the Sept. 8 start date of his trial, even if she lets him represent himself. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.",
      "In a June 29 letter to Cannon, Routh said that he and his attorneys were \"a million miles apart\" and that they were refusing to answer his questions. He also suggested in the same letter that he could be used in a prisoner exchange with Iran, China, North Korea or Russia.",
      "\u201cI could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\u201d Routh wrote.",

      "The threats to the U.S. data infrastructure since January have come not only from the disappearance or modification of data related to gender, sexual orientation, health, climate change and diversity, among other topics, but also from job cuts of workers and contractors who had been guardians of restricted-access data at statistical agencies, the data experts said.",

      "In one of America's favorite party hotspots, residents and business owners say the stench of trash and bad decisions is being scrubbed clean like never before",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The stench of trash and residue of bad decisions in one of America\u2019s favorite party hotspots is being scrubbed away, thanks to a change in garbage collectors that New Orleans residents say has transformed the French Quarter.",
      "\u201cThe Quarter has never been this clean,\u201d said Jill Wagner. She became inured during her three decades living along Bourbon Street to rat-infested, overflowing garbage cans and sidewalks stained with puke, urine and booze. Now, with a zesty lemon fragrance sprayed across the streets daily, \"it smells like Disney World.\u201d",
      "A chorus of residents and business owners is heaping praise on the city's so-called \u201cTrash King,\" Sidney Torres IV, and his company, IV Waste, for cracking the code to sanitary success.",
      "The district has gleamed since Torres was given an emergency year-long contract last December to handle its waste management, they say. Tourists stumbling out of a Bourbon Street bar around sunrise on any given day can find IV Waste employees power-washing sidewalks, scooping up cigarette butts and spritzing streets with his patented \u201clemon fresh\u201d cleaning formula.",
      "But a judge on Wednesday allowed Mayor LaToya Cantrell to replace IV Waste at the end of July, over the objections of the city council. With a local management district insisting on Torres, this raises the possibility of rival collectors competing for the French Quarter's garbage.",
      "\u201cJust because they like the other guy, that is not enough,\u201d the mayor's attorney Charles Rice told the judge, and he said there's \u201cno reason\u201d to believe a different contractor would do worse.",
      "A state appeals court is scheduled to review in August who will ultimately earn tens of millions of dollars managing the French Quarter's trash in 2026 and beyond.",
      "At stake is the attractiveness of some of the most important city blocks in the country, residents say \u2014 New Orleans reports that more than 19 million visitors spent a collective $10 billion last year, and most visited the historic French Quarter.",
      "In a city plagued by dysfunction including constant flooding, treacherous potholes and a massive jailbreak, Torres' company has become a point of civic pride. The quarter is filled with signs in support of IV Waste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even in the same solar system -- the service they provide versus what others provide,\u201d said Danny Conwill, who owns an oyster bar off Bourbon Street and is suing the mayor to keep IV Waste. He recalls other trash collectors leaving \u201cnoxious garbage juices\u201d and heaps of shrimp heads and oyster shells scattered about, leading to rank summer odors bad for business.",
      "Torres, a real estate developer who began as a personal assistant to Lenny Kravitz and once hosted Justin Bieber's 20th birthday party at his Bahamas resort, became a local celebrity and reality TV star after launching a trash company to clean up the city after Hurricane Katrina. He then sold it and waited out a non-compete clause before rebuilding his trash empire with IV Waste.",

      "After a competitive bidding process last year, the city began negotiating a $73 million contract with another local firm, Henry Consulting, to clean the French Quarter for at least the next five years. But before the deal was finalized, council members grew alarmed that the company did not seem to have the necessary equipment or subcontracts in place as Super Bowl LIX and the annual Mardi Gras celebrations loomed.",
      "IV Waste then won an emergency contract to clean the French Quarter through 2025, and Henry Consulting sued, accusing the city of failing to uphold a valid contract.",
      "The metastasizing litigation now pits an outgoing mayor with waning popularity against a feisty city council and state officials including the attorney general, with both sides slinging accusations of cronyism. Cantrell was elected in 2017 with the endorsement of Henry Consulting founder Troy Henry.",
      "In April, Cantrell announced she was terminating the IV Waste contract early, and that Henry's firm would take over. This new no-bid contract would cost $2.1 million more, with inferior results, sanitation director Matt Torri told the city council on Monday. He and other officials said Henry Consulting still doesn't seem ready for the job.",
      "Henry Consulting declined to comment to The Associated Press. Cantrell's office told The AP that the city \u201cremains committed to working with all parties to provide sanitation services to the French Quarter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a new Louisiana law empowers the management district to appoint its own garbage collector, and the residents and business owners who run this state agency selected IV Waste. Torres said his company will keep taking out the trash, even if it means rivals go toe-to-toe on Bourbon Street.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our job, and they can watch and learn,\" Torres said. \u201cThe French Quarter can rest assured that we\u2019re going to continue to clean.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A judge\u2019s order to take a Tennessee death row inmate to the hospital on the morning of his execution so doctors can deactivate his heart-regulating implant would cause \u201cchaos,\u201d state attorneys said in an appeal.",
      "The argument was one of several in a filing Wednesday that seeks to overturn an order to deactivate Byron Black's implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, including when and where to do it. Black is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Aug. 5 at 10 a.m.",
      "His attorneys say his heart device would continuously shock him in an attempt to restore his heart\u2019s normal rhythm during the execution, but the state disputes that and argues that even if shocks were triggered, that Black wouldn't feel them.",
      "Officials said they would need to transfer Black through Nashville the morning of his execution to comply with a judge's order, and that the trip would create security risks, including from protestors. It's about 7 miles from Riverbend Maximum Security Institution to Nashville General Hospital.",
      "Kelley Henry, Black's attorney, said the state presented \u201czero evidence of security risk\" and said state officials were the ones who made the proposed time and place of the hospital procedure public.",
      "The Tennessee Supreme Court is taking up the appeal and fast-tracking it.",
      "A judge sided with Black's attorneys last week, initially ruling that the state must turn off the heart device in the minutes just before the execution.",
      "Black is set to die by a single dose of the barbiturate pentobarbital.",
      "His cardioverter-defibrillator is a small, battery-powered electronic instrument that is surgically implanted in someone\u2019s chest, usually near the left collarbone. It can be deactivated with a handheld machine, but the state says Black\u2019s doctors have refused to come to the prison to do it.",
      "The state asked the judge to either overturn the order about the deactivation or allow the Tennessee Department of Correction to take Black to the hospital for it the day before his execution. After a hearing Tuesday, the judge adjusted his order to say the state needs to take Black to the hospital the morning of his execution rather than deactivating the device minutes before it.",
      "Henry told the judge the deactivation needs to happen immediately before the execution so authorities don't risk accidentally killing Black just before a possible reprieve.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to move thousands of employees out of Washington, D",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture will move thousands of employees out of the nation's capital in a reorganization the agency says will put them closer to customers while saving money, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Thursday.",
      "Around 2,600 workers \u2014 more than half the Washington, D.C. workforce \u2014 will be moved to five hubs stretching from North Carolina to Utah, Rollins said. The union representing federal workers immediately criticized the plan as a ploy to cut federal jobs, pointing out that some 95% of the department's employees already work outside Washington.",
      "The move is part of President Donald Trump's effort to make the federal government slimmer and more efficient, which received a Supreme Court boost this month.",
      "\u201cAmerican agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support,\u201d Rollins said in a statement.",
      "The goal is to re-size the department so that costs don't outstrip available finances, as well as eliminate layers of management and consolidate redundant functions, the statement said. The department expects the plan to take several months.",
      "The five hubs are in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Fort Collins, Colorado; Indianapolis and Salt Lake City.",
      "Although it\u2019s important to be closer to farmers and ranchers, Chad Hart, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University, said taking those employees out of Washington risks losing an important connection to Congress.",
      "\u201cYou want that balance\u201d to ensure effective farm policy, Hart said.",
      "Much of the government savings could come from employees who choose not to relocate, Hart said. He added that the agricultural community is concerned about a \u201cbumpy transition\u201d reminiscent of similar action during Trump\u2019s first term, when it took relocated Agriculture offices months to get up and running again.",
      "Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the labor union representing federal workers, had a sharper critique. He said about 85% of all federal employees already work outside the capital, but insisted Washington \u201cis the center of our nation\u2019s government for a reason.\"",
      "Workers at headquarters help coordinate between senior leaders and field offices, Kelley said, and they ensure the agency has a \u201cseat at the table\u201d when lawmakers and the White House make decisions that affect farmers nationwide.",

      "In the Washington region, the department will vacate three buildings and examine the best use of three others. One building set to be abandoned has $1.3 billion in needed but delayed maintenance and has room for 6,000 employees while only housing 1,900.",
      "Wages will fall too, Rollins promised. The capital region is among the nation\u2019s costliest to live, and department employees there are paid a surcharge of 34% to keep ahead of the cost of living. The surcharges range from 17.1% in Salt Lake City to 30.5% in Fort Collins.",

Hogan cited prosecutorial misconduct in granting a full innocence pardon to Huffington in connection with a 1981 double slaying in Harford County. A Maryland board approved $2.9 million in compensation for Huffington later that year during Gov. Wes Moore's administration.",
      "Huffington said in a statement Thursday that \u201cit took many, many painful years, but the truth eventually came out.\u201d Just 18 at the time of his arrest, he said neither of his parents ever got to see and understand that his name had been cleared and he was set free.",

      "Huffington, 62, always maintained his innocence. He was released from Patuxent Institution in 2013 after serving 32 years of two life sentences.",

Joseph Hudson, Becker\u2019s boyfriend, was fatally shot and found a few miles (kilometers) away.

      "Questions about evidence in the case arose when The Washington Post uncovered an FBI report in 2011 that found the FBI agent who analyzed hair evidence in Huffington\u2019s case may not have used reliable science, or even tested the hair at all. The report had been written in 1999, but Harford County State\u2019s Attorney Joseph Cassilly didn't provide it to Huffington\u2019s lawyers.",

      "In the southern state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala, the New World screwworm fly\u2019s rapid spread appears to have caught most ranchers off guard, despite memories of previous outbreaks in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Mexico is building a plant with U.S. support in Chiapas to produce sterile flies, which have proven effective at stopping the spread, but it won\u2019t be ready until next year. Meanwhile, the price of medicines used to treat livestock infected with the screwworm have soared in price.",
      "That has led some to fall back on home remedies like applying gasoline or lime to open wounds to coax out the worms.",
      "In addition to the cost of the medicine, treatment requires careful monitoring and usually involves multiple courses. Any open wound, even very small ones, are an invitation to the fly to lay its eggs.",
      "Veterinarian Alfredo Ch\u00e1vez left Chiapas to study in 1989, so he says he missed seeing the effects of that outbreak, but now he\u2019s seen cases multiply in his corner of the state over the past month.",
      "He\u2019s heard of dozens of cases in the area now and treated about a dozen himself. It\u2019s not just cows either \u2014 sheep, pigs, cats and dogs are targets as well.",
      "Armed with a pair of blue tweezers and an aerosol spray that helps draw the maggots out, Ch\u00e1vez moves from animal to animal. He puts maggots in plastic tubes as samples, which he provides to agricultural authorities.",
      "But beyond providing the tubes and encouraging ranchers to report cases, he said that the government hasn't provided much help.",

      "The Muscogee Nation Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that two descendants of people once enslaved by the tribe are entitled to tribal citizenship.",
      "The court found that the tribal nation\u2019s citizenship board violated an 1866 treaty when it denied the applications of Rhonda Grayson and Jeffrey Kennedy in 2019 because they could not identify a lineal descendant of the tribe.",
      "\u201cAre we, as a Nation, bound to treaty promises made so many years ago? Today, we answer in the affirmative, because this is what Mvskoke law demands,\u201d the court wrote in its opinion.",
      "The Muscogee Nation is one of five tribes in Oklahoma that once practiced slavery, and in that 1866 treaty with the U.S. government, the tribe both abolished it and granted citizenship to the formerly enslaved. But in 1979, the tribal nation adopted a constitution that restricted membership to the descendants of people listed as \u201cMuscogee (Creek) Indians by blood\u201d on the Dawes Rolls, a census of members of the five tribes created around 1900.",
      "When the Dawes Rolls were created, people were listed on two separate rolls: those who were Muscogee and those who were identified by the U.S. government as Freedmen. In its ruling Wednesday, the court remanded the matter back to the Muscogee Nation's citizenship board and directed it to apply the Treaty of 1866 to Grayson and Kennedy's applications, as well as any future applicants who can trace an ancestor to either roll.",
      "The decision could create a path to tribal citizenship for thousands of new members who are not Muscogee by blood.",

It\u2019s time now to come together, rebuild trust, and move forward as one united Nation, ensuring future generations never again face exclusion or erasure,\" she said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cWhen I heard the ruling, I felt generations of my family exhale at once,\" Kennedy added in a statement. \u201cOur ancestors signed that treaty in good faith, and today the Court finally honored their word.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are currently reviewing the order to understand its basis as well as its implications for our processes,\u201d Muscogee Nation Chief David Hill said in a statement. \u201cIt may be necessary to ask for a reconsideration of this order to receive clarity so that we can ensure that we move forward in a legal, constitutional manner.\u201d",

      "Washington sees Beijing, the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, as its biggest competitor, and consecutive presidential administrations have sought to shift U.S. military and economic focus to the Asia-Pacific in a bid to counter China. Trump, like others before him, has been distracted by efforts to broker peace in a range of conflicts, from Ukraine to Gaza.",
      "Tariffs also are expected to be on the agenda. Trump has threatened to impose 20% tariffs on Filipino goods on Aug. 1 unless the two sides can strike a deal.",
      "\"I intend to convey to President Trump and his Cabinet officials that the Philippines is ready to negotiate a bilateral trade deal that will ensure strong, mutually beneficial and future-oriented collaborations that only the United States and the Philippines will be able to take advantage of,\u201d Marcos said Sunday when he was departing for Washington, according to his office.",

      "Attorney General Phil Weiser also disclosed that his office is investigating whether other law enforcement officers on a regional drug task force the deputy worked on have been sharing information to help federal agents make immigration arrests in violation of state law limiting cooperation in immigration enforcement. The federal government has sued Colorado over such laws.",
      "On June 5, Mesa County Deputy Alexander Zwinck allegedly shared the driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration and insurance information of the 19-year-old nursing student in a Signal chat used by task force members, according to the lawsuit. The task force includes officers who work for federal Homeland Security Investigations, which can enforce immigration laws, the lawsuit said.",
      "After federal immigration officers told him in the chat that the student did not have a criminal history but had an expired visa, Zwinck allegedly provided them with their location and told her to wait with him in his patrol car for about five minutes, asking about her accent and where she was born. He let her go with a warning and gave federal agents a description of her vehicle and told her which direction she was headed so they could arrest her, the lawsuit said.",
      "When Zwinck was told of the arrest, the lawsuit said he congratulated the federal agents, saying \u201crgr, nice work.\u201d The following day, one federal immigration agent praised Zwinck's work in the chat, saying he should be named \u201dinterdictor of the year\" for the removal division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Zwinck is also accused of violating the law again on June 10 by providing immigration officers with the photo of the license of another driver who had overstayed his visa, information about the person's vehicle and directions to help them arrest the driver. After being told that immigration officers \u201cwould want him\u201d, Zwinck replied that \u201cWe better get some bitchin (sic) Christmas baskets from you guys\u201d, the lawsuit said.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",

      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

      "\"He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Hogan lately began to invest in alternatives to theatrical, professional wrestling, announcing plans in April to serve as the first commissioner for the Real American Freestyle organization, which describes itself as \"the first unscripted pro wrestling\" league in the world. The first event is Aug. 30 at Cleveland State University.",
      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches. He often would play off his interviewer, \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, starting his interviews off with, \"Well, lemme tell ya something, Mean Gene!\"",
      "In 2016, a Florida jury awarded Hogan $115 million in a lawsuit against Gawker Media and then added $25 million in punitive damages. Hogan sued after Gawker in 2012 posted a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife. He contended the post violated his privacy.",
      "Hogan smiled and wore black throughout the three-week trial.",
      "\"Everywhere I show up, people treat me like I'm still the champ,\" he said of the support from fans.",

      "The former Fleetwood Mac bandmates shared a pair of cryptic messages across their Instagram accounts last week which combined to read, \"And if you go forward\u2026 I'll meet you there\" \u2014 lyrics from \"Frozen Love,\" a song off the duo's fabled 1973 album. Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",
      "On Wednesday, Nicks and Buckingham jointly posted a video of a billboard advertising the album's reissue going up in Los Angeles, announcing in the post's caption that the first single from the release, a newly remastered edition of \"Crying In The Night,\" was available now to stream.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract. The album's last official release was a 1981 vinyl pressing from Polydor, according to Discogs, but the record has never been available on CD or digital, although bootlegs have surfaced over the years.",
      "Now, premium vinyl record producer Rhino High Fidelity is gearing up to release the full album on Sept. 19, alongside fresh liner notes from music journalist David Fricke, including interviews with both Buckingham and Nicks.",
      "\"[We] knew what we had as a duo, two songwriters that sang really well together. And it was a very natural thing, from the beginning.\" Nicks is quoted as saying in a Rhino press release. Buckingham said the album \"stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\"",
      "The remastered album is now available to pre-order in a standard edition and a deluxe edition, which includes two 7-inch singles, \"Crying In The Night\" and \"Don't Let Me Down Again.\" The standard edition is limited to 5,000 copies, while the singles are numbered to 2,000.",
      "Rumors of a possible \"Buckingham Nicks\" reissue have percolated for years. Back in 2011, Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the album has \"been a victim of inertia. It's funny, I spent a lot of time with Stevie this year when she was finishing her album and we were getting along great. We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",
      "Rhino sourced the audio for the remastered vinyl from the duo's original analog master tapes of the album, which was recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, not far from the billboard announcing its long-awaited return.",

      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",

Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",

      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",

      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record.

      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",

I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",

      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said. An autopsy determined his cause of death to be asphyxiation by submersion.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",

      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",
      "Cosby shared a memory of Warner with CBS News' Jericka Duncan on Monday, saying, \"He was never afraid to go to his room and study and make sure he followed whatever he had learned in the acting school he went to.\"",

      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",

      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

The president has argued that cutting borrowing costs would boost economic growth, but the central bank has worried that slashing rates could make inflation worse. Powell has also cited the uncertainty of economic impacts of Mr. Trump's tariffs as another factor.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",

Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",

      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines.

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",
      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",

      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

      "The president thanked companies present at the summit for investing in data centers and other projects, saying they'll create thousands of jobs.",
      "The Wednesday announcement is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four technology investors and entrepreneurs who include Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar David Sacks.",
      "\"The goal here is for the United States to win the AI race,\" Sacks said during a press call with reporters Wednesday morning.",
      "The plan is backed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will be carried out over the next six months to a year, according to Michael Kratsios, policy director of the OSTP.",
      "\"This is a watershed day for Trump to lay out the AI vision and make sure the U.S. stays ahead of China despite all the trade deal turmoil,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What is the AI Action Plan?",
      "The AI Action Plan focuses on accelerating AI innovation and building out AI infrastructure to ensure the U.S. leads in international \"AI diplomacy,\" according to Sacks, who laid out the plan's major pillars during Wednesday's call.",
      "That includes expediting the construction of large-scale data centers, which house servers, networking gear and other technology used to power artificial intelligence.",
      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",
      "DEI regulations within the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act \"burden the industry\" and \"slow down the delivery of critical projects,\" they said.",

    "summary": "The fallout from Elon Musk's dive into politics a year ago is still weighing on Tesla sales, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "The fallout from Elon Musk's plunge into politics a year ago is still hammering electric vehicle-maker Tesla, as both sales and profits dropped sharply again in the latest quarter.",
      "Tesla revenue dropped 12%, and profits slumped 16% in the three months through June as buyers continued to steer clear, and in some cases, turn to more affordable competitors' offerings.",
      "\"The perception of Elon Musk, its chief executive, has rubbed the sheen right out of what once was a darling and soaring automotive brand,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said in a research note, in which he called Tesla \"a toxic brand that is inseparable from its leader.\"",
      "Quarterly profits at the electric vehicle, battery and robotics company fell to $1.17 billion, or $0.33 a share, from $1.4 billion, or $0.40 a share, dropping for a third straight quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company said it earned $0.40, in line with Wall Street analysts' estimates.",
      "Revenue fell from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion in the April through June period, slightly beating Wall Street's forecast.",
      "Tesla shares were little changed in after-hours trading as investors awaited Musk's comments on the company's earnings call.",
      "Betting on robotaxis",
      "Musk, who helped elect President Donald Trump with a massive campaign donation and then headed his DOGE cost-cutting program, has pinned the future of the company squarely on its autonomous Robotaxi venture, which launched in Austin, Texas last month. It's expected to take years, though, before Musk's focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots turns a profit or the company.",
      "\"We are at a 'positive crossroads' in the Tesla story: Musk is laser focused as CEO, Robotaxi/autonomous expansion has begun, demand stabilization has begun especially in China, and Tesla is about to embark on an aggressive AI focused strategy that we believe will include owning a significant piece of xAI,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. \"While near-term and this quarter the numbers are nothing to write home about, we believe investors are instead focused on the AI future at Tesla with a motivated Musk back driving Tesla's future.\"",
      "Foreign EV buyers have also turned away from Tesla toward competitors' vehicles, research shows. Musk alienated potential Tesla customers in Great Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere through his political activities. Rival electric vehicle makers such as China's BYD and German's Volkswagen, meanwhile, have gained market share.",
      "Tesla faces other headwinds, too. The new federal budget just passed by Congress eliminates a $7,500 credit for EV buyers. It also wipes out penalties for car makers that exceed carbon emission standards. That threatens Tesla's business of selling its \"carbon credits\" to traditional car companies that regularly fall short of emission standards.",
      "Tesla generated $439 million from credit sales, down sharply from $890 million a year ago.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

      "\"This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.\"",
      "Price increases typically take around 90 days to take effect, although the timeframe varies by retailer, the spokesperson added.",
      "Global cocoa shortage",
      "Cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years due to a global cocoa shortage. The cost for the commodity was $8,402 in June, a 73% increase from five years ago, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which tracks food prices.",
      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain.

The threats came near the end of a 90-day pause on most of the sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs Mr. Trump unveiled against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in April.",
      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",
      "The letters have \"gotten these countries to the table, and they are going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff,\" Lutnick said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "Target is ending a price matching policy that for\u00a012 years\u00a0allowed customers to request a price match if they found an identical item with a lower cost at competitors Amazon or Walmart.",
      "The\u00a0policy\u00a0enabled a price match if shoppers could provide proof of the lower price within 14 days of their purchase. The product had to be identical in brand name, size, weight, color and model number, and had to be sold and fulfilled by Amazon or Walmart, according to the Target policy.",
      "After July 28, customers will only be able to request a price match for products sold at either Target or Target.com, not competitors Amazon and Walmart, according to a Target spokesperson. The company said that it's ending price matching for products sold by the two rival retailers because \"guests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers.\"",
      "Target introduced its competitor price match policy in 2013. At the time, former Target CEO and president Gregg Steinhafel said the policy provided \"unbeatable value.\"",
      "Other retailers that have price matching policies include Best Buy and\u00a0Home Depot. Walmart also has a price matching policy, although it's for Walmart.com, not competitors.",
      "Target's decision to end its price matching policy comes as the retailer is struggling to boost sales and store traffic. In its most recent earnings report released in May, the company reported a nearly 3% decline in sales during the first quarter compared to the same time last year.",

The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which tracks Americans' sentiment toward business and labor market conditions, fell 5.4 points in June, a sign consumers may be more cautious about the state of the economy.",

      "Southwest Airline's open seating policy is coming in for its final approach.",
      "The Texas-based carrier said Monday that flights with assigned seats will begin on Jan. 27, 2026, marking the end of an era\u00a0in which the discount carrier for decades bucked industry norms by having passengers choose their seats during boarding.",
      "Southwest, which announced last year that it was abandoning open seating, said customers can start booking flights with assigned seats starting on July 29.",
      "\"Assigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\" Tony Roach, executive vice president of customer & brand at Southwest Airlines, said in a statement.",
      "The new policy will allow travelers to choose from\u00a0different fare bundles and seat options, including those offering more legroom. A Southwest spokesperson said the airline is unable for now to offer details on how its fares will change under the new reservation system.",
      "The airline also recently did away with its \"bags fly free\" policy, signaling a broader shift in its revenue strategy amid mounting financial pressure. People who book flights on or after May 28 must pay $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second.",
      "New boarding process",
      "Southwest also announced on Monday that it is overhauling its boarding process.",
      "The new boarding sequence will group passengers based on seat location, with priority given to people who choose seats with extra legroom and to loyalty program members. Southwest customers can also pay for priority boarding if they want to move up in the queue.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 George Pappas, Jennifer Peyton and Carla Espinoza were all federal immigration judges fired this month by email. The three ruled on thousands of immigration cases in Chicago and Boston.",
      "\"It was arbitrary, unfair,\" Pappas told CBS News of his firing. \"And it's an attack on the rule of law. It's an attack on judges.\"",
      "Pappas served as an immigration judge in Boston until this week, overseeing more than 2,000 cases during his two years on the bench. Peyton led Chicago's immigration court for nearly nine years, hearing thousands of cases until she was abruptly fired over the 4th of July weekend.",
      "Peyton oversaw Espinoza, who was appointed in 2023 and decided more than 1,000 cases in the last fiscal year, double the average for immigration judges.",
      "Peyton told CBS News she received no reason for her firing. Immigration judges are under the authority of the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review.",
      "\"My email was three sentences,\" Peyton said. \"I had no cause. I had no explanation.\"",
      "\"We as judges, were in fear, we were concerned,\" Espinoza added. \"That makes it very difficult to be impartial. We were not succumbing to that pressure but it does feel like pressure.\"",
      "Both Pappas and Peyton disclosed that they were told how they should rule on immigration cases.",
      "\"They told me: Grant the motions to dismiss,\" Pappas said. \"This is when ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was roaming the courthouses. Because if we dismissed the case, that person that responded then leaves the court vulnerable to immediate apprehension and expedited removal.\"",
      "CBS News has reported on the numerous cases where ICE agents detained immigrants as they exited their court hearings.",
      "\"Once they left the courtroom, more often than not, they would be handcuffed and led away by the ICE officers,' Peyton added.",
      "According to the Executive Office for Immigration Review,  Federal immigration courts now face a backlog nearing four million cases, with about 600 judges left to hear those cases.",
      "The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration court judges, reports that since the Trump Administration took office, more than 100 immigration\u00a0 judges have either been fired, transferred, or have taken retirement offers.",
      "According to the union, immigration judges are considered Justice Department employees, and therefore do not have lifetime appointments like federal judges in the judicial branch.",
      "In a Truth Social post\u00a0in April, President Trump argued that, \"We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years.\"",
      "It is my opinion that this administration could give a hoot about the backlog,\" Pappas said.",
      "In defending its immigration crackdown, the White House has repeatedly argued that undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. And in May, the Trump administration began an effort to halt the immigration court cases of certain migrants in order to fast-track their deportation process, government officials and attorneys told CBS News at the time. Espinoza counters that the court system exists to ensure the law is followed, and attempts to circumvent it could prove to be a slippery slope.",
      "\"That's why they're in proceedings in court,\" Espinoza said of the immigrants. \"There is law that we're applying, and they might have to go, and they might not...Today it's them, it's immigrants. What about tomorrow? Who's going to get due process denied next.\"",
      "\"If you're attacking the very judges that adjudicate cases, there's not going to be a rule of law. That should concern everybody, not just immigrants, but U.S. citizens.\"",
      "When reached by CBS News, the Justice Department had no comment on the union's allegations that several immigration judges had been fired without cause.",
      "And in response to claims from former judges that the firings are a targeted attack on immigration courts, the Justice Department said, \"To the contrary, the Trump Administration is vigorously enforcing our nation's immigration laws.\"",
      "And regarding the allegations from judges who spoke to CBS News that they were pressured to rule a certain way, the Justice Department said, \"Although the Biden Administration did pressure Immigration Judges to rule a certain way, including to grant motions to dismiss, the Trump Administration has restored the rule of law and is ensuring that judges are adhering to the law.\"",

      "President Trump on Thursday introduced new rules for the name, image and likeness and revenue-sharing deals that have shaken up college sports in recent years, seeking to rein in what the White House called an \"out-of-control, rudderless system.\"",
      "The executive order seeks to ban \"third-party, pay-for-play payments to collegiate athletes,\" while still allowing athletes to strike brand endorsement deals. It also says any revenue-sharing arrangements between universities and athletes should expand or preserve \"scholarships and collegiate athletic opportunities in women's and non-revenue sports.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's order also said schools with more than $50 million in athletic revenue cannot reduce the number of scholarship opportunities for \"non-revenue sports\" \u2014 typically sports other than football and basketball. Schools that draw more than $125 million are directed to increase their non-revenue scholarships in the coming academic year.",
      "The president also directed the National Labor Relations Board to work on \"clarifying the status of collegiate athletes\" \u2014 likely referring to moves by some college athletes to be deemed university employees and form labor unions.",
      "It's not clear how the order will be enforced. Mr. Trump tells top administration officials to \"develop a plan\" within 30 days to advance the order using \"all available and appropriate regulatory, enforcement, and litigation mechanisms.\" It floated decisions about federal funding, Title IX enforcement and work with Congress.",
      "CBS News was first to report on Mr. Trump's plan to sign a college sports-focused executive order last week.",
      "In recent years, collegiate sports have been reshaped by drastic policy changes that allow student-athletes to make millions of dollars while still in school.",
      "The NCAA in 2021 permitted athletes to earn money for the use of their name, image and likeness, or NIL. Since then, some big-name student-athletes have scored the types of lucrative brand endorsement deals that were once more closely associated with professional athletes.",
      "Rules restricting schools from directly paying athletes have also been loosened. A legal settlement involving the NCAA earlier this year allowed schools to start sharing revenue with athletes for the first time, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the NCAA's attempts to limit some benefits to athletes violated antitrust law.",
      "The changes mark a stark departure from college sports' previous operating model, in which athletes were thought of as amateurs and were paid in college scholarships. That system faced stiff criticism from many student-athletes, who viewed it as unfair to block them from being compensated even as their work, in some cases, brought in millions of dollars for their schools.",
      "But the new landscape has also drawn fears about whether smaller colleges will struggle to compete with their larger peers' checkbooks, and whether sports that don't generate much revenue for colleges will face more pressure. And fans of certain schools have formed so-called NIL collectives that draw in donations and offer endorsement deals to players, an arrangement some critics have called a \"pay-to-play scheme.\"",
      "\"Absent guardrails to stop the madness and ensure a reasonable, balanced use of resources across collegiate athletic programs that preserves their educational and developmental benefits, many college sports will soon cease to exist,\" Mr. Trump's executive order signed Thursday states.",
      "Meanwhile, most states have passed their own laws regulating NIL, but the federal government doesn't have a uniform standard. This week, a House committee advanced the SCORE Act, which would set national NIL rules. But there's concern that the bill\u00a0doesn't do enough to protect athletes' interests.",
      "The NCAA said in a statement after Thursday's executive order that it \"appreciates the Trump Administration's focus on the life-changing opportunities college sports provides millions of young people.\"",
      "\"The NCAA is making positive changes for student-athletes and confronting many challenges facing college sports by mandating health and wellness benefits and guaranteeing scholarships, but there are some threats to college sports that federal legislation can effectively address and the Association is advocating with student-athletes and their schools for a bipartisan solution with Congress and the Administration,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement.",

Markus then confirmed that Maxwell's legal team was in discussions with the government.",

The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "It will be up to the judges to decide whether the grand jury material can be disclosed. If they grant the requests, the information will likely be heavily redacted, and it is likely to be weeks or months before the transcripts are unsealed.",
      "In addition to facing backlash from some of his allies, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have pushed to make material related to Epstein public.",
      "A House panel voted Wednesday to subpoena the Justice Department for files related to the federal probe into Epstein. The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed Maxwell to sit for a deposition next month at the federal detention center in Tallahassee.",
      "Mr. Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said in 2019, following Epstein's arrest, that they hadn't spoken in 15 years.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Trump signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter. The president has denied that he wrote the letter, calling it \"fake,\" and sued the Journal and its owners for defamation. He is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",

      "Grace, who was Habba's deputy, was selected by the judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey to serve as the U.S. attorney for the state as Habba's 120-day term in the post wound down. But shortly after, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Grace had been removed as first assistant U.S. attorney, and she excoriated the judges for tapping Grace, instead of letting Habba stay in the role.",
      "\"This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges \u2014 especially when they threaten the president's core Article II powers,\" Bondi wrote on social media.",
      "The attorney general's post raised questions about who would be the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey as the 120-day clock on Habba's interim term expires. A court order signed by Chief Judge Renee Bumb said Grace's appointment was effective Tuesday or \"upon the expiration of 120 days after\" Habba's appointment by Bondi.",
      "But Habba said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X, \"I am now the Acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey\" and indicated she would fight for the job. The Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Trump pulled Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney, which avoids a provision of federal law that restricts\u00a0a person\u00a0from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. That law limits her time as acting U.S. attorney to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on March 24 that he had tapped Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which would put the expiration of her term at July 22. But Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general, has said her tenure as interim U.S. attorney ends Friday.",
      "Habba has the Justice Department leaders behind her, and they've accused New Jersey judges of playing politics with their decision not to keep Habba in the post.",
      "Mr. Trump had nominated Habba for the role of U.S. attorney, but New Jersey's two home-state senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, oppose her.",
      "\"President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Habba was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in several civil cases brought against him in New York, and she joined the White House as a counselor to the president after Mr. Trump won a second term. The president announced in March that he had tapped Habba to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in her home state of New Jersey. Federal law limited her time as interim U.S. attorney to 120 days.",
      "Habba deserves the job, according to Armen Morian, who worked alongside Habba in a 2023 New York civil case in which Mr. Trump, his company and top executives were found liable for fraud.",
      "\"I think she's eminently qualified to be U.S. attorney, and I think she's doing a fine job of it,\" Morian said.",
      "Morian hit back at Habba's critics who questioned her suitability for the job, having never previously been a prosecutor.",
      "\"President Trump is a very unconventional figure, and he forces us, I think, to reconsider a lot of the assumptions we make. Sometimes it's very useful to put somebody into an office who has shown to you that she has sufficient judgment and will do well in the position,\" Morian said.",
      "But the state's two senators, Booker and Kim, opposed her nomination. Under the Senate Judiciary Committee's \"blue slip\" policy, a nomination for U.S. attorney or to a federal district court will not move forward unless both home-state senators return positive blue slips.",
      "With the 120-day deadline on Habba's term approaching, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey invoked their power under federal law and voted to replace Habba with Grace, her deputy.",
      "Can judges even appoint the U.S. attorney?",
      "Yes. A federal statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies specifies that if the attorney general's appointment of a U.S. attorney expires after 120 days, the district court can name a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "The law requires an order of appointment by the court to be filed with the clerk of the court.",
      "\"The reason why you have this 120-day deadline followed by judicial appointments was so that the president is incentivized to get someone confirmed because after 120 days, you lose the authority within the executive branch to control who is the U.S. attorney,\" Thomas Barry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "While rare, courts have exercised this power before.",
      "The judges on the U.S. district court in New Mexico selected Gregory Fouratt to serve as the top federal prosecutor in the state in January 2008, and in 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, the district court in New Jersey appointed Craig Carpenito the state's U.S. attorney as his 120-day term was set to run out. Also that year, the U.S. district court in Manhattan tapped Geoffrey Berman to serve as the district's top federal prosecutor.",
      "But Berman's exit in June 2020 was rocked by confusion when then-Attorney General Bill Barr announced that Berman would be \"stepping down.\" Berman, however, said he had not resigned and had no intention of doing so. Barr then informed Berman that Mr. Trump had removed him from the post.",
      "Does Bondi have the power to remove a court-appointed U.S. attorney?",
      "It doesn't seem so. In a 1979 opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which is not binding, then-Assistant Attorney General John Harmon explained that \"the president is responsible for the conduct of a U.S. Attorney's Office and therefore must have the power to remove one he believes is an unsuitable incumbent, regardless of who appointed him.\"",
      "Harmon also said that when it comes to whether the attorney general has the authority to terminate a court-appointed U.S. attorney, \"We answer this questions [sic] in the negative.\" He said federal law regarding the removal of U.S. attorneys constitutes \"the specific exercise of legislative power under Article II, section 2, clause 2, vesting in the president the power of removing a court-appointed U.S. attorney.\"",
      "In a social media post, Blanche wrote that Grace had been ousted \"pursuant to the president's authority.\"",
      "\"This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive,\" he wrote.",
      "Berry said there have been very few, if any, judicial decisions, about the removal of interim U.S. attorneys, especially if the attorney general disagrees with the court's appointment.",
      "Habba's appointment as acting U.S. attorney",
      "Until Thursday \u2014 because Mr. Trump had nominated her to serve as New Jersey's chief federal prosecutor \u2014 Habba did not appear to be eligible to serve as acting U.S. attorney in the state.",
      "The situation involving Habba and the U.S. attorney position in New Jersey potentially involved the interactions of two different federal laws: the statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies, which gives district courts the power to name someone to that role temporarily; and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 27-year-old law that limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Mr. Trump used the law, also known as the Vacancies Act, during his first term to install a number of \"acting\" leaders across the executive branch.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Vacancies Act sets out three categories of federal workers who can move into a position covered by the law: the \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office; another administration official who has been confirmed by the Senate; and an agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy occurred and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale.",
      "Grace, who the New Jersey judges selected to succeed Habba, was the first assistant.",
      "But the law prohibits a person from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. The upper chamber received Habba's nomination from Mr. Trump on June 30. His withdrawal of her nomination now enables Habba to serve as acting U.S. attorney, as she resigned from the interim post \u2014 the role the district judges declined to keep her in \u2014 and was then appointed first assistant U.S. attorney by Bondi. Habba then could become acting U.S. attorney because the position is unfilled.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to have used the Vacancies Act to put at least one acting attorney general in place \u2014 John Sarcone who is currently leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albany.",
      "Bondi announced in early March that Sarcone had been appointed the interim top federal prosecutor for the Northern District of New York, but earlier this month, the U.S. district court there declined to tap him for U.S. attorney. Bondi instead named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" which effectively gives him the power of a U.S. attorney. Sarcone was named first assistant U.S. attorney as well, effectively leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "Berry said there is a loophole in the Vacancies Act that allows a lower-ranking official who does not require Senate confirmation to perform the duties of a senior leader when that role is vacant, which could be used to Habba's benefit.",
      "\"Subdelegation is so easy to do throughout the executive branch,\" he said. \"This exact same maneuver is done all the time for all sorts of offices.\"",
      "What happens to Grace?",
      "In a post Wednesday on LinkedIn, Grace indicated she is no longer the No. 2 in the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, but signaled she was prepared to follow the judges' order that names her the interim U.S. attorney, even though Bondi fired her from her post as the first assistant.",
      "\"It will forever be the greatest honor that they selected me on merit, and I'm prepared to follow that Order and begin to serve in accordance with the law,\" Grace wrote.",
      "The dozens of comments beneath Grace's LinkedIn post highlight her deep ties in the state, and high regard among New Jersey law enforcement.",
      "Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O'Hara, who previously was Newark, New Jersey's Safety Director, congratulated Grace.",
      "\"Desiree Grace Anyone who knows you knows the heart, integrity, and commitment you bring to the job. You have definitely made a difference,\" O'Hara wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order making it easier for cities and states to remove homeless people from the streets and get them treatment elsewhere.",
      "The president's order asks Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"reverse judicial precedents and end consent decrees that limit state and local governments' ability to commit individuals on the streets who are a risk to themselves or others,\" according to a White House fact sheet. It also commits federal funding to move people on the streets who are \"causing public disorder and that are suffering from serious mental illness or addiction\" to \"treatment centers, assisted outpatient treatment, or other facilities.\"",
      "\"Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order,\" the text of the order said. \"Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety.\"",
      "The executive order the president also asks Bondi to work with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation to prioritize federal grants for states and cities that \"enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering,\" the White House said. The order was first reported by USA Today.",
      "\"President Trump is delivering on his commitment to Make America Safe Again and end homelessness across America,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"By removing vagrant criminals from our streets and redirecting resources toward substance abuse programs, the Trump administration will ensure that Americans feel safe in their own communities and that individuals suffering from addiction or mental health struggles are able to get the help they need.\"",
      "In March, Mr. Trump called for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser to \"clean up all of the unsightly homeless encampments in the City, specifically including the ones outside of the State Department, and near the White House.\" He added that if she was \"not capable of doing so, we will be forced to do it for her!\" He signed an executive order directing the National Park Service to clear all homeless encampments on federal lands.",
      "He also signed a\u00a0separate executive order\u00a0in March aiming to dismantle the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness.",
      "The president pledged to remove homeless individuals from the nation's streets during his campaign.",
      "\"When I am back in the White House, we will use every tool, lever, and authority to get the homeless off our streets,\" Mr. Trump said in a spring 2023 campaign video.",
      "The National Homelessness Law Center said the order \"does nothing to lower the cost of housing or help people make ends meet.\"",
      "\"Forced treatment is unethical, ineffective, and illegal. People need stable housing and access to healthcare. Rather, Trump's actions will force more people into homelessness, divert taxpayer money away from people in need, and make it harder for local communities to solve homelessness,\" said spokesperson Jesse Rabinowitz.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News he's \"absolutely convinced\" Republicans will expand their narrow margin in the House in next year's midterms.",
      "\"I am very bullish on election night '26. I'm absolutely convinced we're going to grow the House majority,\" Johnson told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on Wednesday. \"It's not groundless optimism. It's going to be the result of a lot of hard work.\"",
      "Historically, the president's party almost always loses ground in the midterms right after a presidential race. The party that controls the White House has only managed to improve its edge in the House in a midterm election twice in the last 80 years, in 1998 and 2002. That trend is typically driven by backlash against the incumbent president \u2014 and over the last six months, President Trump's approval rating has slid from 53% to 42%, according to CBS News polling.",
      "But Johnson said he believes his party has opportunities to go on offense, pointing to the 13 House Democrats who represent districts that Mr. Trump won in 2024, versus three Republicans whose districts went for former Vice President Kamala Harris. He also noted demographic shifts in the 2024 race, which saw Mr. Trump make gains with Black and Latino voters.",
      "\"I like those odds,\" Johnson said.",
      "Johnson also said a controversial plan by Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional districts \"probably inures to our benefit,\" though he also said, \"the jury's still out on that one\" and \"we're still awaiting the outcome.\" Johnson told CBS News on Wednesday the state's Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will \"need to follow the law\" and \"be fair.\"",
      "Johnson predicts \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" will serve as economic \"jet fuel\"",
      "Johnson predicted voters will \"feel the benefits\" of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation extends trillions of dollars' worth of tax cuts, appropriates new funding for border security, and adds or expands work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "Some 61% of U.S. adults disapprove of the law, according to a CBS News poll released Sunday. Some 47% of Americans believe it will hurt them and their families, versus 28% who say it won't have much of an effect on their families and only 25% who say it will help them.",
      "\"I'm not surprised by those numbers, because they've gotten a steady diet of misinformation by most of the mainstream media and the Democrats,\" Johnson told CBS News.",
      "He predicted that the bill will serve as \"jet fuel\" for the economy, and pointed to an estimate by House Republicans that its tax provisions could deliver as much as $13,300 in extra take-home pay to the typical family.",
      "The White House's Council of Economic Advisers said in a report that a family with two children could see between $7,800 and $13,300 in additional take-home pay \"in the long run\" as a result of the bill.",
      "The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found Americans from most income levels will see tax savings from the law next year, averaging $2,900 per household, though higher-income people will see a bigger impact. The group said $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes of about $217,000 or more.",
      "Asked if voters will hold Republicans accountable in the midterms for the bill's promised tax benefits, Johnson said: \"They'll see it, and they will vote accordingly.\"",
      "Johnson also hailed a set of crypto bills that are moving through Congress. Last week, Mr. Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, which creates a regulatory structure for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. Another bill that would set broader rules for digital assets, the CLARITY Act, is still pending.",
      "Johnson said of the crypto legislation: \"It will spur on innovation and more investment. And I think it's going to be a big thing for the future.\"",

      "Many economists warn that higher tariffs could lead to steeper consumer prices and slower economic growth \u2014 though Mr. Trump has defended the strategy.",
      "\"The sky was going to fall, everybody told us, and it hasn't,\" Johnson said.",
      "He also said Congress has traditionally \"given a lot of latitude to the executive\" to negotiate trade deals, amid concern from some lawmakers that Congress should be involved in major tax policy rather than deferring to the president on tariffs.",
      "And Johnson called allegations that House Republicans have been overly deferential to Mr. Trump \"nonsense.\" He said he and Mr. Trump are \"working as a unified government,\" but he discusses contentious issues with the president \"behind the curtains.\"",

      "\"The challenged provisions of New York City law reflect the City's intentional effort to obstruct the United States' enforcement of federal immigration law, by (among much else) impeding the consultation and communication between federal and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for the United States to enforce the law and keep Americans safe,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "\"New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said. \"If New York City won't stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will.\"",

      "\"We're going to flood the zones\"",
      "\"I made a statement the other day about New York. We're going to flood the zones. The sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don't want, more agents in the communities and more worksite enforcement. Why is that? Because they won't let one agent arrest one bad guy in a jail. They're going to release a public safety threat back in the community. Now, I got to send the whole team to go find that person.

Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows. That's why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council \u2014 but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer. So far, the Council has refused. We will review the lawsuit,\" a spokesperson for Mayor Adams said.",

      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell, accusing him of not acting quickly enough to slash interest rates \u2014 the Fed has currently set a benchmark rate of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has remained all year. The president has argued that cutting borrowing costs would boost economic growth, but the central bank has worried that slashing rates could make inflation worse. Powell has also cited the uncertainty of economic impacts of Mr. Trump's tariffs as another factor. Mr. Trump has brought up the idea of firing Powell but later said it's \"highly unlikely\" he would.",

      "\"It's a rocky road for him between now and then,\" Johnson said. \"I do believe a lot of economists will say, when the economy is hot, when it's running \u2014 and ours is, and we're ramping up lots of great development \u2014 that that is not a time for you to reduce interest rates. But I think desperate times call for desperate measures.\"",

      "\"If you reduce the rates just a small percentage, you can solve that problem,\" he said. \"I think that would be a big thing for the economy and I think he ought to duly consider that. It would save the nation a lot of money and would give a lot more people more opportunity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

      "Johnson said he had \"never seen the Epstein evidence, it was not in my lane.\"",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case has drawn weeks of public scrutiny, since the Justice Department and FBI released a review of the federal investigations into the financier. The review found no evidence that Epstein had an incriminating \"client list\" or tried to blackmail powerful people. It also concluded that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "Those findings have not satisfied some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have called on the Justice Department to release all the information on the Epstein case. A handful of House Republicans joined with Democrats on Wednesday to vote on subpoenaing the Justice Department for some of its files on Epstein.",

Earlier this week, Johnson accused Democrats of playing \"political games\" by trying to force a vote.

      "It will be Wisconsin's highest profile race next year, as Democrats also angle to take control of the Legislature thanks to redrawn election maps that are friendlier to the party. They are also targeting two congressional districts as Democrats nationwide try to retake the House.",
      "The Legislature has been under Republican control since 2011, and some Democrats had hoped that Evers, 73, would run for a third term to give him a chance to potentially work with a Democratic-controlled one.",
      "In a video announcing his decision, Evers said he was \"damn proud\" of working 50 years in public service. But he said it was time to focus on his family.",
      "\"For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service,\" Evers said. \"They're my world and I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together.\"",
      "Evers has drawn the ire of President Trump's administration, and his tenure has been marked by his often contentious relationship with the Legislature.",
      "Before Evers even took office, Republicans convened a lame-duck session to pass a package of laws to weaken his power.",
      "Evers angered Republicans during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when he ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close, issued a statewide mask mandate and tried, unsuccessfully, to delay the state's April presidential primary.",
      "Republicans broke with tradition to reject 21 Evers appointees. They also blocked many of his proposals, including expanding Medicare, legalizing marijuana and spending more on child care, K-12 schools and higher education.",
      "Evers used his broad veto powers to stop Republicans from enacting a wide range of conservative priorities, including making voting requirements more strict, expanding gun rights, growing the private school voucher program and making abortions more difficult to obtain.",
      "But Evers did work with Republicans to pass the most recent state budget, which included $1.5 billion in tax cuts prioritized by the GOP and more funding for both K-12 special education and the University of Wisconsin. Evers also worked with Republicans to keep the Brewers in Milwaukee and funnel more money to local governments.",
      "Evers pushed for the redrawing of Wisconsin's legislative boundary lines, which the state Supreme Court ordered after liberal justices gained a majority in 2023.",
      "The maps drawn by Republicans, which had been in place for more than a decade, were widely regarded as among the most gerrymandered in the country. The new maps drawn by Evers are more favorable to Democrats and helped them pick up seats in last November's election. Democrats are optimistic that they can win control of at least one legislative chamber next year.",
      "Evers waited until after he signed the state budget before making his retirement announcement.",
      "\"I promised you when I ran for this office that I'd always work to do the right thing, that I'd always give it to you straight, and that I'd always try to be a governor for all of Wisconsin. And I work every day to keep those promises. That'll never change,\" he said.",
      "The open race is sure to attract several Democratic and Republican candidates. Democrats mentioned as potential candidates include Attorney General Josh Kaul, Lt. Gov. Sarah Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.",
      "Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and suburban Milwaukee businessman Bill Berrien are running as Republicans. Others, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, are considering it.",
      "The last open race for governor was in 2010, when Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle, similar to Evers, opted not to seek a third term. Republican Scott Walker won that year and served two terms before Evers defeated him in 2018.",
      "The only Wisconsin governor to be elected to a third four-year term was Republican Tommy Thompson, who served from 1986 to 2001. He resigned midway through his fourth term.",
      "Evers won the gubernatorial race in 2018 by little more than a percentage point. In 2022, he fended off a challenge from Trump-endorsed Tim Michels.",
      "Before being elected governor, Evers worked for 10 years as state superintendent of education after a career as a teacher and school administrator.",
      "Evers positioned himself as a folksy governor who would sprinkle the occasional mild swear word into his comments and other Midwestern colloquialisms such as \"holy mackerel\" and \"folks.\" His mild-mannered demeanor stood in stark contrast to Trump and other political firebrands.",
      "\"I think he is the most quintessential Wisconsin politician I've ever seen,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been in elected office since 1991.",

    "summary": "Ryan Routh is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Routh, the man charged with trying to assassinate President Trump last year in South Florida, can represent himself during his trial, a federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh's request to represent himself but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel.",
      "Earlier in the week, the federal public defenders had asked to be taken off the case, saying Routh had refused repeated attempts to meet with them.",
      "Routh, 59, is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot Mr. Trump as he played golf.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. He has also pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "The judge told Routh earlier this month that she doesn't intend to delay the Sept. 8 start date of his trial, even if she lets him represent himself. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.",
      "In a June 29 letter to the judge, Routh said he and his attorneys were \"a million miles apart\" and that they were refusing to answer his questions. He also suggested in the same letter that he could be used in a prisoner exchange with Iran, China, North Korea or Russia.",
      "\"I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\" Routh wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, the federal public defender's office filed a motion for termination of appointment of counsel, saying \"the attorney-client relationship is irreconcilably broken.\" Attorneys said Routh refused to meet with them for a scheduled in-person meeting Tuesday morning at the federal detention center in Miami. They said Routh has refused six attempts to meet with their team.",
      "\"It is clear that Mr. Routh wishes to represent himself, and he is within his Constitutional rights to make such a demand,\" the motion said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "The incident followed another attempted assassination, last July, which took place at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Mr.\u00a0 Trump and two others were injured, and one man, Corey Comperatore, was killed when a gunman, Thomas Crooks, fired shots. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 14:00:59 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration had planned to eliminate all paper checks by Sept. 30. Now the agency says it will continue issuing checks as needed.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration said it will continue issuing paper checks to the retirement program's beneficiaries, backing away from a previously announced plan to switch all payments to electronic deposits after Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate. Typically, these people rely on check-cashing services or other non-bank financial companies, such as PayPal or Venmo, rather than banks.",
      "About one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, according to the AARP. People who are underbanked may have a bank account but still primarily rely on alternative banking services, like check cashing establishments, to handle their money.",
      "Focus on customer service",
      "Warren also said she addressed other issues with Bisignano, including concerns that a major workforce reduction at the Social Security Administration this year could affect customer service.",
      "The senator said Bisignano agreed to her request that the agency's inspector general conduct an independent audit to assess the state of customer service at SSA, such as call wait times and how many Social Security recipients are able to reach a human employee when they call for help.",
      "\"More accurate data is absolutely essential to oversight, to holding the Social Security Administration accountable to the job they are required to do,\" Warren said.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said\u00a0customer service is improving, noting that the agency has reduced its phone response time to an average of 18 minutes in 2025, down from 30 minutes in 2024.",
      "\"Commissioner Bisignano had a productive meeting with Senator Warren where he presented improved customer service metrics that are currently being realized on the phone, in field offices and online,\" a Social Security Administration spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Senator Warren reacted positively to many of the indicators, specifically lower phone and field office wait times, the reduction of the disability claims backlog by 25% and the speed at which the SSFA payments were completed \u2014 give months ahead of schedule.\"",

    "summary": "The Pentagon's internal watchdog has evidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used details from a classified email when he shared information about US strikes on Yemen on Signal earlier this year, according to two U.S. officials.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Pentagon's internal watchdog has obtained evidence that encrypted messages sent from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Signal account included details from a classified email, according to two senior American officials with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The chat messages listed out information on a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen in March, and were sent to several Trump administration officials in a Signal group \u2014 which became public when a reporter was inadvertently added to the chat. At the time, administration officials denied that any classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "Key information in the messages was derived from a classified email marked \"SECRET//NOFORN,\" said the two officials, who both requested anonymity to speak about an ongoing investigation into top Trump administration officials.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means that the information was classified and the disclosure of this information could potentially cause serious damage to national security, potentially jeopardizing the safety of service members. The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "The Washington Post first reported about the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General receiving the evidence on Wednesday.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Wednesday, the Inspector General's office said it would not comment about ongoing oversight projects. In April, the Defense Department IG announced it would evaluate the Defense Secretary's use of commercial messaging applications for official business and whether his office complied with classification and records retention requirements.",
      "The Pentagon's chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement, \"The Department stands behind its previous statements: no classified information was shared via Signal.\" He also called reporting on the secretary's use of the Signal app \"so old and worn out, it's starting to resemble Joe Biden's mental state.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have faced staunch scrutiny since the existence of the Signal chat messages was first reported by The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was accidentally added to the Signal chat group by then-National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Trump officials in the Signal chat group have repeatedly denied that classified information was shared in the group.",
      "But the two U.S. officials with knowledge of the evidence received by the Pentagon's watchdog office told CBS News on Wednesday that the information Hegseth posted in the encrypted Signal chat group was derived from a classified email sent out by Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla to dozens of defense officials. Kurilla oversees U.S. Central Command, which is the primary Defense Department organization responsible for conducting U.S. military operations in the Middle East.",
      "The Atlantic published screenshots that it said were from the Signal chat, which appeared to show Hegseth sharing a timeline of planned attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It listed the timing of two sets of F-18 launches and strikes, a set of drone strikes and some Tomahawk missile strikes.",
      "\"Just CONFIRMED w/ CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,\" one message read, according to the magazine.",
      "Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in an April statement: \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story.\" He made that claim after reporting showed Hegseth also shared details in a separate Signal chat that included members of his family.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe \u2014 both of whom appeared to be members of the chat group \u2014 also told lawmakers in March that classified material wasn't shared.",
      "Ratcliffe said that Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials, and the group chat was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "The defense secretary, according to federal regulations, has the authority to declassify information, but after the messages surfaced, Hegseth didn't answer when asked by reporters whether he took that approach before sharing the information on Signal.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" Hegseth told reporters in March.",
      "Signal is a free messaging app that's popular due to its high standard of encryption, which prevents people other than the senders or recipients from viewing messages.",
      "Human error remains a vulnerability for Signal and other encrypted apps, as the episode involving Hegseth demonstrated. And in February, the National Security Agency warned its staff that Russian hacking groups were using phishing messages to gain access to Signal users' accounts, allowing them to view victims' activity, according to documents obtained by CBS News earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump is due to arrive Friday for what the White House is calling a \"working visit\" to Scotland. It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",
      "The American leader will also meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer near the end of his trip in Scotland, and the current 25% U.S. tariffs on British steel imports could be a focus of discussion.",
      "Trump visits bring protests and security concerns",
      "Mr. Trump has Scottish roots through his mother, who was born in 1912 as Mary Anne MacLeod on the Scottish island of Lewis in the remote Outer Hebrides.",
      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a luke-warm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the polices he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been\u00a0 organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",
      "A senior Scottish police official told Britain's Sky News it would be \"inappropriate\" to ignore the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump a year ago.",
      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III. Starmer hand-delivered the invitation for that visit, on behalf of the monarch, when he visited Mr. Trump at the White House in February.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday declassified additional materials on the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions in the 2016 election, claiming in a social media\u00a0post and at a White House press briefing that they showed Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" information in order to undermine then-candidate Donald Trump.",
      "Her statement on X said the documents show Obama officials \"manufactured the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew was false, promoting the LIE that Vladimir Putin and the Russian government helped President Trump win the 2016 election.\"",
      "Democrats disputed her claims and accused Gabbard of misrepresenting the intelligence findings. Wednesday's report follows a separate set of declassified documents on the matter released by Gabbard last Friday. In a memo accompanying those documents, she similarly accused Obama administration officials of plotting a \"years-long coup\" against Mr. Trump.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement regarding the first set of materials, \"These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\" he said, a likely reference to turmoil in Congress over the release of files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Rodenbush also said nothing in last week's documents \"undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes.\" Rodenbush has not responded to the most recent release of material.",
      "Gabbard also said in her X statement that it was Mr. Trump who made the decision to declassify the House Republicans' report.",
      "The Wednesday release was a declassified report that was compiled in 2017 and finalized in 2020 by the House Intelligence Committee's Republican majority \u2014 where FBI Director Kash Patel was a lead staffer at the time, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It focuses at length on the intelligence community's judgment that Russian president Vladimir Putin aspired to help Mr. Trump to win the 2016 election.",
      "It includes discussions of raw intelligence provided by a human source to the CIA, as well as Signal intercepts gathered by the National Security Agency, prompting concerns from current and former intelligence officials and condemnation from Democrats about the risks it could pose to sensitive intelligence sources and methods.",
      "But the report does not fundamentally change previous assessments by the U.S. intelligence community \u2014 or the multiple reviews that followed.",
      "\"The desperate and irresponsible release of the partisan House intelligence report puts at risk some of the most sensitive sources and methods our Intelligence Community uses to spy on Russia and keep Americans safe,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said in a statement. \"And in doing so, Director Gabbard is sending a chilling message to our allies and assets around the world: the United States can no longer be trusted to protect the intelligence you share with us.\"",
      "An Office of the Directorate of National Intelligence official said the president's ultimate declassification authority meant he was not obligated to consult with intelligence agencies about redacting sensitive content in the report.",
      "At the White House briefing Monday, Gabbard accused President Obama of \"leading the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment.\" She told reporters that the documents would be sent to the Justice Department and FBI for investigation of \"criminal implications.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe whether she thinks Obama is guilty of treason, Gabbard responded that she would leave criminal charges to the Justice Department, but said what occurred \"can only be described as a years-long coup and a treasonous conspiracy against the American people.\"",
      "She declined to directly answer another question from O'Keefe about how the latest declassified documents change previous assessments, given that the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 which included then-Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 dedicated an entire volume of its five-volume investigation to the intelligence community's analysis..",
      "\"[W]e are ensuring that the intelligence community is not being politicized, Gabbard said. \"Look at the evidence and you will know the truth.\"",
      "The House committee's Republican-authored report criticizes the review of the analysis underlying the assessment that went into the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, for several reasons, including that its production was rushed to be released before Mr. Trump took office. It also claimed analysts failed to consider plausible alternative explanations for Putin's intentions and questioned whether they sufficiently took into account the human source's motivations, proximity to Putin or bias towards Mr. Trump.",
      "The GOP House committee report zeroes in on a piece of intelligence contained in a report from a human source that it contends was subjected to \"questionable interpretation\" by analysts.",
      "\"The unclear fragment (shown in bold) is part of a sentence in a [redacted] that reads, 'Putin had made this decision [to leak DNC emails] after he had come to believe that the Democratic nominee had better odds of winning the U.S. presidential election, and that [candidate Trump] whose victory Putin was counting on, most likely would not be able to pull off a convincing victory,'\" a bullet says on page 4 of the report.",
      "It adds that a senior CIA operations officer said at the time, \"We don't know what was meant by that\" and \"five people read it five ways.\"",
      "The findings align in many areas with a separate tradecraft review released earlier this month by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, which determined that the confidence level in the assessment that Putin aspired to help Mr. Trump win should have been \"moderate\" instead of \"high,\" chiefly because it was derived from one source instead of multiple. The CIA's report, however, did not include any detailed discussion of the sensitive sources or methods involved.",
      "The CIA's own review of the intelligence that informed the finding on Putin's preference \"confirmed that the clause was accurately represented\u2026and that the ICA authors' interpretation of its meaning was most consistent with the raw intelligence.\" It more broadly found that much of the tradecraft underlying the 2017 assessment was \"robust and consistent\" with analytic standards.",
      "The CIA declined to comment on the report released by Gabbard.",
      "Democrats seized on the timing of the disclosures \u2014 which they pointed out could have been made at any time during the first Trump administration or since he took office for a second time.",
      "\"It's appropriate that this shoddy and partisan report was released by Director Gabbard on the day that House Republicans are quite literally fleeing Washington, D.C., for six weeks rather than releasing the Epstein files that Trump is so desperate to cover up,\" said House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes.",
      "\"Given the rushed and unusual 'declassification' process the DNI has implemented, I fear that the public release of this report could compromise sensitive sources and methods and endanger our national security,\" Himes said.",

      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 Australia announced it will reduce restrictions on U.S. beef imports in a move President Trump's administration claimed as a major victory over \"non-scientific trade barriers\" to trade.",
      "Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said Thursday that relaxing the restrictions designed to keep Australia free of mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, would not compromise biosecurity.",
      "\"Australia stands for open and free trade \u2014 our cattle industry has significantly benefited from this,\" Collins said in a statement.",
      "Trump administration calls it a \"major trade breakthrough\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins responded to Australia's announcement by congratulating Mr. Trump on a \"major trade breakthrough that gives greater access to U.S. beef producers selling to Australia.\"",
      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines. This is yet another example of the kind of market access the President negotiates to bring America into a new golden age of prosperity, with American agriculture leading the way.\"",
      "Australia has allowed imports of beef grown in the U.S. since 2019, but not allowed imports from the U.S. of beef sourced from Canada or Mexico because of the disease risk.",
      "The U.S. has recently introduced additional movement controls that identify and trace all cattle from Mexico and Canada to their farms of origin. Australian authorities were \"satisfied the strengthened control measures put in place by the U.S. effectively manage biosecurity risks,\" Collins said.",

      "Mr. Trump attacked Australian import restrictions on U.S. beef when he announced in April that tariffs of at least 10% would be placed on Australian imports, with steel and aluminum facing a 50% tariff.",
      "\"Australia bans \u2014 and they're wonderful people, and wonderful everything \u2014 but they ban American beef,\" Mr. Trump told reporters then. \"Yet we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",
      "Opposition lawmaker David Littleproud said he suspected the government was endangering Australia's cattle industry to appease Mr. Trump.",
      "Concerns over mad cow disease in imported cattle",
      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",
      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",
      "\"When you have a $75 billion (Australian $50 billion) industry relying on them not making this mistake, I'm sure they've been very cautious in their decision-making,\" he added.",
      "But Australian demand for U.S. beef is likely to remain low despite the eased restrictions, for reasons including a relatively weak Australian dollar.",
      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:06:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. But Wednesday's decision appears to mark the first time that an appellate court has weighed in on the merits of Mr. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants by executive order.",
      "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit wrote that Mr. Trump's order is \"invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the purpose and the text of the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed an executive order that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit disagreed. It wrote Wednesday that a plain reading of the 14th Amendment suggests that citizenship was meant to be granted to anybody who is \"subject to the laws and authority of the United States.\"",
      "\"The Defendants' proposed interpretation of the Citizenship Clause relies on a network of inferences that are unmoored from the accepted legal principles of 1868,\" the judges wrote.",
      "\"Perhaps the Executive Branch, recognizing that it could not change the Constitution, phrased its Executive Order in terms of a strained and novel interpretation of the Constitution,\" the opinion said.",
      "The issue reached the 9th Circuit after a lower court in Washington state blocked the birthright citizenship executive order in February, responding to a lawsuit from several Democratic states. The Trump administration in March\u00a0appealed that ruling. It reasserted its arguments about who the 14th Amendment applies to, called the ruling \"vastly overbroad\" and argued the states did not have standing to sue over the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit said the states did have the right to sue, pointing to the risk that states would be financially harmed by a federal policy that narrows who qualifies for citizenship. The appellate judges also upheld the district court's finding that the states are likely to succeed in showing the order violates the Constitution.",
      "The 9th Circuit's ruling was written by Clinton-appointed Judge Ronald Gould, and joined by Obama-appointed Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. A third member of the panel \u2014 Judge Patrick Bumatay, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term \u2014 dissented in part, writing that the states don't have standing and adding \"it's premature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the injunction.\"",
      "Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on merits of birthright citizenship \u2014 yet",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the Supreme Court earlier this year, but not in a case involving the merits of the Trump administration's policy.",
      "Instead, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the district courts that issued nationwide blocks against Mr. Trump's executive order were exceeding the scope of their power \u2014 a perennial topic of debate in legal circles that has frustrated presidents of both parties.",
      "The high court's ruling last month limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the 9th Circuit ruled on Wednesday, the government has argued that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states argue that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",

      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites.

    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "\"Around the globe, everyone is talking about artificial intelligence,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"I find that too, 'artificial' \u2014 I can't stand it. I don't even like the name. I don't like anything that's artificial, so could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything. Because it's not artificial, it's genius. It's pure genius.\"",

      "The memo also concluded that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they would not release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "But the Trump administration's conclusions rankled some of his allies, who were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there is nothing left to divulge.",
      "Some of the administration's top officials, including Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel, had suggested before Mr. Trump returned to the White House that Democrats were hiding information about Epstein and his alleged list of clients.",
      "In an effort to quell the backlash, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York who handled Epstein and Maxwell's cases to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving the two.",
      "Earlier this week, judges overseeing the requests each ordered the Justice Department to submit additional filings to the court about its efforts to unseal the grand jury records. The judges gave the defendants \u2014 in Epstein's case, his representative \u2014 and victims until Aug. 5 to lay out their positions on the proposed disclosure.",
      "It will be up to the judges to decide whether the grand jury material can be disclosed. If they grant the requests, the information will likely be heavily redacted, and it is likely to be weeks or months before the transcripts are unsealed.",
      "In addition to facing backlash from some of his allies, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have pushed to make material related to Epstein public.",
      "A House panel voted Wednesday to subpoena the Justice Department for files related to the federal probe into Epstein. The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed Maxwell to sit for a deposition next month at the federal detention center in Tallahassee.",
      "Mr. Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said in 2019, following Epstein's arrest, that they hadn't spoken in 15 years.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Trump signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" CBS News has not independently seen or verified the letter. The president has denied that he wrote the letter, calling it \"fake,\" and sued the Journal and its owners for defamation. He is seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "The Journal reported Wednesday that when Justice Department officials reviewed documents related to Epstein earlier this year, they learned Mr. Trump's name appeared multiple times. Bondi and her deputy told the president at a White House meeting in May that his name was in the so-called Epstein files, as were those of other public figures, according to the Journal. Mr. Trump being mentioned does not mean he committed any wrongdoing.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said in response to the Journal's report that \"The fact is that The President kicked him out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 18:58:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The federal district court in New Jersey appointed Alina Habba's deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to serve as U.S. attorney.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday withdrew the nomination of Alina Habba, his former defense lawyer, to serve as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, a Justice Department official confirmed, which clears the way for her to serve as the U.S. attorney in the state in an acting capacity.",
      "Mr. Trump's move came after a federal district court set off a leadership scramble in the U.S. attorney's office when it declined to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and instead installed Desiree Leigh Grace as the state's top federal prosecutor.",
      "Grace, who was Habba's deputy, was selected by the judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey to serve as the U.S. attorney for the state as Habba's 120-day term in the post wound down. But shortly after, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Grace had been removed as first assistant U.S. attorney, and she excoriated the judges for tapping Grace, instead of letting Habba stay in the role.",
      "\"This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges \u2014 especially when they threaten the president's core Article II powers,\" Bondi wrote on social media.",
      "The attorney general's post raised questions about who would be the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey as the 120-day clock on Habba's interim term expires. A court order signed by Chief Judge Renee Bumb said Grace's appointment was effective Tuesday or \"upon the expiration of 120 days after\" Habba's appointment by Bondi.",
      "But Habba said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X, \"I am now the Acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey\" and indicated she would fight for the job. The Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Trump pulled Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney, which avoids a provision of federal law that restricts\u00a0a person\u00a0from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. That law limits her time as acting U.S. attorney to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on March 24 that he had tapped Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which would put the expiration of her term at July 22. But Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general, has said her tenure as interim U.S. attorney ends Friday.",
      "Habba has the Justice Department leaders behind her, and they've accused New Jersey judges of playing politics with their decision not to keep Habba in the post.",
      "Mr. Trump had nominated Habba for the role of U.S. attorney, but New Jersey's two home-state senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, oppose her.",
      "\"President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Habba was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in several civil cases brought against him in New York, and she joined the White House as a counselor to the president after Mr. Trump won a second term. The president announced in March that he had tapped Habba to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in her home state of New Jersey. Federal law limited her time as interim U.S. attorney to 120 days.",
      "Habba deserves the job, according to Armen Morian, who worked alongside Habba in a 2023 New York civil case in which Mr. Trump, his company and top executives were found liable for fraud.",
      "\"I think she's eminently qualified to be U.S. attorney, and I think she's doing a fine job of it,\" Morian said.",
      "Morian hit back at Habba's critics who questioned her suitability for the job, having never previously been a prosecutor.",
      "\"President Trump is a very unconventional figure, and he forces us, I think, to reconsider a lot of the assumptions we make. Sometimes it's very useful to put somebody into an office who has shown to you that she has sufficient judgment and will do well in the position,\" Morian said.",
      "But the state's two senators, Booker and Kim, opposed her nomination. Under the Senate Judiciary Committee's \"blue slip\" policy, a nomination for U.S. attorney or to a federal district court will not move forward unless both home-state senators return positive blue slips.",
      "With the 120-day deadline on Habba's term approaching, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. district court in New Jersey invoked their power under federal law and voted to replace Habba with Grace, her deputy.",
      "Can judges even appoint the U.S. attorney?",
      "Yes. A federal statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies specifies that if the attorney general's appointment of a U.S. attorney expires after 120 days, the district court can name a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "The law requires an order of appointment by the court to be filed with the clerk of the court.",
      "\"The reason why you have this 120-day deadline followed by judicial appointments was so that the president is incentivized to get someone confirmed because after 120 days, you lose the authority within the executive branch to control who is the U.S. attorney,\" Thomas Barry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "While rare, courts have exercised this power before.",
      "The judges on the U.S. district court in New Mexico selected Gregory Fouratt to serve as the top federal prosecutor in the state in January 2008, and in 2018, during Mr. Trump's first term, the district court in New Jersey appointed Craig Carpenito the state's U.S. attorney as his 120-day term was set to run out. Also that year, the U.S. district court in Manhattan tapped Geoffrey Berman to serve as the district's top federal prosecutor.",
      "But Berman's exit in June 2020 was rocked by confusion when then-Attorney General Bill Barr announced that Berman would be \"stepping down.\" Berman, however, said he had not resigned and had no intention of doing so. Barr then informed Berman that Mr. Trump had removed him from the post.",
      "Does Bondi have the power to remove a court-appointed U.S. attorney?",
      "It doesn't seem so. In a 1979 opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which is not binding, then-Assistant Attorney General John Harmon explained that \"the president is responsible for the conduct of a U.S. Attorney's Office and therefore must have the power to remove one he believes is an unsuitable incumbent, regardless of who appointed him.\"",
      "Harmon also said that when it comes to whether the attorney general has the authority to terminate a court-appointed U.S. attorney, \"We answer this questions [sic] in the negative.\" He said federal law regarding the removal of U.S. attorneys constitutes \"the specific exercise of legislative power under Article II, section 2, clause 2, vesting in the president the power of removing a court-appointed U.S. attorney.\"",
      "In a social media post, Blanche wrote that Grace had been ousted \"pursuant to the president's authority.\"",
      "\"This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive,\" he wrote.",
      "Berry said there have been very few, if any, judicial decisions, about the removal of interim U.S. attorneys, especially if the attorney general disagrees with the court's appointment.",
      "Habba's appointment as acting U.S. attorney",
      "Until Thursday \u2014 because Mr. Trump had nominated her to serve as New Jersey's chief federal prosecutor \u2014 Habba did not appear to be eligible to serve as acting U.S. attorney in the state.",
      "The situation involving Habba and the U.S. attorney position in New Jersey potentially involved the interactions of two different federal laws: the statute governing U.S. attorney vacancies, which gives district courts the power to name someone to that role temporarily; and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 27-year-old law that limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Mr. Trump used the law, also known as the Vacancies Act, during his first term to install a number of \"acting\" leaders across the executive branch.",
      "Enacted in 1998, the Vacancies Act sets out three categories of federal workers who can move into a position covered by the law: the \"first assistant,\" or deputy, to the vacant office; another administration official who has been confirmed by the Senate; and an agency employee who has worked there for at least 90 days in the year before the vacancy occurred and is at the highest level of the civil service pay scale.",
      "Grace, who the New Jersey judges selected to succeed Habba, was the first assistant.",
      "But the law prohibits a person from serving as an acting officer if the president has submitted their nomination to the Senate. The upper chamber received Habba's nomination from Mr. Trump on June 30. His withdrawal of her nomination now enables Habba to serve as acting U.S. attorney, as she resigned from the interim post \u2014 the role the district judges declined to keep her in \u2014 and was then appointed first assistant U.S. attorney by Bondi. Habba then could become acting U.S. attorney because the position is unfilled.",
      "Mr. Trump appears to have used the Vacancies Act to put at least one acting attorney general in place \u2014 John Sarcone who is currently leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albany.",
      "Bondi announced in early March that Sarcone had been appointed the interim top federal prosecutor for the Northern District of New York, but earlier this month, the U.S. district court there declined to tap him for U.S. attorney. Bondi instead named him \"special attorney to the attorney general,\" which effectively gives him the power of a U.S. attorney. Sarcone was named first assistant U.S. attorney as well, effectively leaving him in charge of the office.",
      "Berry said there is a loophole in the Vacancies Act that allows a lower-ranking official who does not require Senate confirmation to perform the duties of a senior leader when that role is vacant, which could be used to Habba's benefit.",
      "\"Subdelegation is so easy to do throughout the executive branch,\" he said. \"This exact same maneuver is done all the time for all sorts of offices.\"",
      "What happens to Grace?",
      "In a post Wednesday on LinkedIn, Grace indicated she is no longer the No. 2 in the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey, but signaled she was prepared to follow the judges' order that names her the interim U.S. attorney, even though Bondi fired her from her post as the first assistant.",
      "\"It will forever be the greatest honor that they selected me on merit, and I'm prepared to follow that Order and begin to serve in accordance with the law,\" Grace wrote.",
      "The dozens of comments beneath Grace's LinkedIn post highlight her deep ties in the state, and high regard among New Jersey law enforcement.",
      "Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O'Hara, who previously was Newark, New Jersey's Safety Director, congratulated Grace.",
      "\"Desiree Grace Anyone who knows you knows the heart, integrity, and commitment you bring to the job. You have definitely made a difference,\" O'Hara wrote.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order making it easier for cities and states to remove homeless people from the streets and get them treatment elsewhere.",
      "The president's order asks Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"reverse judicial precedents and end consent decrees that limit state and local governments' ability to commit individuals on the streets who are a risk to themselves or others,\" according to a White House fact sheet. It also commits federal funding to move people on the streets who are \"causing public disorder and that are suffering from serious mental illness or addiction\" to \"treatment centers, assisted outpatient treatment, or other facilities.\"",
      "\"Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order,\" the text of the order said. \"Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety.\"",
      "The executive order the president also asks Bondi to work with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation to prioritize federal grants for states and cities that \"enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering,\" the White House said. The order was first reported by USA Today.",
      "\"President Trump is delivering on his commitment to Make America Safe Again and end homelessness across America,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"By removing vagrant criminals from our streets and redirecting resources toward substance abuse programs, the Trump administration will ensure that Americans feel safe in their own communities and that individuals suffering from addiction or mental health struggles are able to get the help they need.\"",
      "In March, Mr. Trump called for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser to \"clean up all of the unsightly homeless encampments in the City, specifically including the ones outside of the State Department, and near the White House.\" He added that if she was \"not capable of doing so, we will be forced to do it for her!\" He signed an executive order directing the National Park Service to clear all homeless encampments on federal lands.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the high court to halt a lower court decision that ordered the NIH to reinstate the grants and required the Trump administration to continue paying out roughly $783 million in awards. The administration had decided that the grants did not align with its policy objectives.",

      "NIH began ending the grants that it said did not match the administration's policy priorities in February,\u00a0 and in April, 16 states, as well as research and advocacy groups, a union and researchers filed lawsuits challenging the cancellations.",
      "The plaintiffs asked the federal district court in Massachusetts to block NIH from terminating any grants and order the agency to restore any awards that had already been axed.",
      "The district court last month ruled in favor of the research entities after holding a bench trial in the cases, finding that NIH engaged in \"no reasoned decision-making\" in the rollout of the grant terminations. U.S. District Judge William Young, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, tossed out the challenged directives.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the district court's decision, which it declined to do.",

      "Sauer pointed to an April order from the Supreme Court that cleared the way for the Department of Education to cancel millions of dollars in grants that it said funded programs that involve DEI initiatives. The high court said in that order that the Trump administration was likely to succeed in showing that the federal district court that oversaw that case lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",

      "\"The challenged provisions of New York City law reflect the City's intentional effort to obstruct the United States' enforcement of federal immigration law, by (among much else) impeding the consultation and communication between federal and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for the United States to enforce the law and keep Americans safe,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "\"New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said. \"If New York City won't stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will.\"",

      "\"We're going to flood the zones\"",
      "\"I made a statement the other day about New York. We're going to flood the zones. The sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don't want, more agents in the communities and more worksite enforcement. Why is that? Because they won't let one agent arrest one bad guy in a jail. They're going to release a public safety threat back in the community. Now, I got to send the whole team to go find that person. So you know, we're going to find the bad guy whether they help us or not,\" Homan said.",
      "\"The job of a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city \u2014 and that's exactly what Mayor Adams has worked to do every day for nearly four years. Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows. That's why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council \u2014 but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer. So far, the Council has refused. We will review the lawsuit,\" a spokesperson for Mayor Adams said.",

      "Continued Trump administration pressure on sanctuary city laws",
      "One of Bondi's first directives after she was sworn in as attorney general focused on sanctuary jurisdictions.

      "Temperatures on Thursday are forecast to be 10 to 15 degrees above average for this time of year with feels-like temperatures over 100 degrees expected in multiple areas.",
      "Some parts of the Mississippi Valley will continue to see high temperatures over 90 degrees and feels-like temperatures over 100 degrees for at least a few more days, even as the heat dome moves over parts of the Northeast.",
      "What is a heat dome?",
      "A heat dome happens when hot air is trapped over an area due to a persistent high pressure system, William Gallus, a professor of atmospheric science at Iowa State University, said.",
      "Heat domes can last for days to weeks and can stretch over multiple states.",

      "With extreme heat in the Corn Belt, a region including parts of the Plains and Central Mississippi Valley, a phenomenon known as corn sweat has made the humidity worse, experts said.",
      "\"There are pores on the bottom side of the leaves,\" Iowa state climatologist Justin Glisan told CBS News national correspondent Lana Zak. \"And that's where oxygen is released, but also water vapor.\"",
      "The process can add up to 10 degrees to the feels-like temperature, Glisan said, because just 1 acre of corn can release as much as 4,000 gallons of water into the air per day. Iowa has around 13 million acres of corn.",

    "summary": "When the former Canadian junior hockey players were charged in early 2024\u200b, four of them played in the NHL.",
    "story": [
      "An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team on Thursday in their sexual assault case, saying the complainant's allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges.",
      "Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia said prosecutors could not meet the onus of proof for the charges against Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube and Callan Foote.",
      "The players' identities were made public when they were charged in early 2024. At the time, four of them played in the NHL \u2014 Dube for the Calgary Flames, Hart for the Philadelphia Flyers, and McLeod and Foote for the New Jersey Devils. Formenton had previously played for the Ottawa Senators before joining a Swiss team. All went on indefinite leave and none is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league.",
      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of five hours, highlighting the complainant's \"tendency to blame others\" for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \"great lengths\" to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 to a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",
      "The players, who are now between the ages of 25 and 27, were in London at the time for a gala and golf tournament marking their championship victory.",
      "The woman testified in May that she was naked, drunk and scared when four of the men showed up unexpectedly in her room at the Delta Hotel London Armouries and felt the only \"safe\" option was to do what they wanted. Prosecutors argued the players did what they wanted without taking steps to ensure she was voluntarily consenting to sexual acts.",
      "\"I made the choice to dance with them and drink at the bar, I did not make the choice to have them do what they did back at the hotel,\" she testified.",
      "Defense attorneys cross-examined her for days and suggested she actively participated in or initiated sexual activity because she wanted a \"wild night.\" Two short videos of the complainant taken by McLeod the night of the encounter were played in court. In one, the woman says it was \"all consensual,\" though she told the court that wasn't how she truly felt.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a packed London courthouse on Thursday morning, holding signs that signaled support for the complainant.",
      "The Associated Press and other news organizations do not identify sexual assault accusers unless they have granted permission to do so, which she has not.",
      "The public didn't learn of the allegations for years. Police closed their initial investigation without charges in early 2019, but the complainant sued Hockey Canada in 2022. The organization settled the lawsuit amid intense scrutiny that cost it sponsors, but police reopened their investigation.",
      "The NHL launched its own investigation in 2022. Officials pledged to release the findings, though Commissioner Gary Bettman said in February that would depend on what the league can say given the legal proceedings.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News he wants \"full transparency\" in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, as the Trump administration faces pressure \u2014 including from some Republicans \u2014 to release more information on the late child sex offender.",
      "\"We want full transparency. We want everybody who is involved in any way with the Epstein evils \u2014 let's call it what it was \u2014 to be brought to justice as quickly as possible. We want the full weight of the law on their heads,\" Johnson told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview Wednesday.",
      "\"It's not a hoax. Of course not,\" said the House speaker, a Louisiana Republican, when asked if he considers it a hoax \u2014 a word that has been used by President Trump to describe some of his supporters' interest in the Epstein case.",
      "Johnson said he had \"never seen the Epstein evidence, it was not in my lane.\"",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case has drawn weeks of public scrutiny, since the Justice Department and FBI released a review of the federal investigations into the financier. The review found no evidence that Epstein had an incriminating \"client list\" or tried to blackmail powerful people. It also concluded that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "Those findings have not satisfied some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have called on the Justice Department to release all the information on the Epstein case. A handful of House Republicans joined with Democrats on Wednesday to vote on subpoenaing the Justice Department for some of its files on Epstein.",
      "Johnson and other House GOP leaders have resisted a push to hold a floor vote to force the release of materials on Epstein. Earlier this week, Johnson accused Democrats of playing \"political games\" by trying to force a vote. Johnson sent the House home for its summer break early amid the controversy roiling the lower chamber over the release of the Epstein files. The House had initially been scheduled to be in session through Thursday, but ended on Wednesday instead.",
      "Asked about the Epstein case \u2014 and the FBI and Justice Department's findings \u2014 Johnson told CBS News on Wednesday, \"I have the same concern and question that a lot of people do.\"",
      "At Mr. Trump's direction, the Justice Department last week asked federal courts to unseal grand jury testimony related to the federal criminal probes into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. A judge in Florida denied a request to release grand jury material stemming from investigations into Epstein in the 2000s, which ended without federal charges. Separate requests to release material from Epstein and Maxwell's more recent cases in New York are still pending, and could take some time.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has urged his supporters to stop focusing on the issue, arguing Democrats are trying to capitalize on it.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 15:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

      "Seeking flight logs, travel records, information about handling of Epstein materials",
      "A bipartisan effort led by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to compel the release of Epstein-related files could have enough support to force a floor vote soon after House lawmakers return from their five-week break in September.",
      "The legislation, known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, would require the Justice Department to release much more than the grand jury testimony that the president has asked courts to make public.",
      "It calls for the release of documents relating to all investigations into the disgraced financier and his accomplice Maxwell, flight logs and travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications. It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates, as well as documentation about his death.",
      "Supporters of the legislation said it's necessary because it would be legally binding, unlike a Republican resolution \u2014 which may not ever get a vote \u2014 that was offered last week as a way to quiet dissent. The resolution from Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina calls for the release of much of the same documentation, but would carry no legal weight if the Trump administration does not follow through.",
      "Epstein died by suicide while in federal custody in Manhattan as he was facing sex trafficking charges in 2019. Prosecutors alleged he exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005. In Florida in 2008, he pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges \u2014 one of them for soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigned following criticism of his handling of Epstein's 2008 plea deal when he was a federal prosecutor in Florida. Epstein served 13 months in a jail work-release program after he was originally accused of sexually abusing dozens of girls and young women.",
      "Johnson argued the Massie-Khanna effort does not include enough protections for Epstein's victims. He said Congress has a moral and legal obligation \"to protect the people who have been the victims of these unspeakable crimes so that their names are not drug through the mud.\"",
      "On Wednesday, three Republicans on a House Oversight subcommittee voted with all Democrats on the panel to subpoena the Justice Department for the Epstein files. The White House has not responded to the latest congressional efforts, although Mr. Trump has referred to the whole saga as a \"hoax,\" as his administration faces criticism over the handling of the Epstein files.",
      "Epstein's financial network",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has been looking into Epstein's financial network for three years and has called on the Trump administration to release the Treasury's records.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration allowed committee staff to look at portions of the confidential file. Wyden said it shows more than 4,700 in potentially suspicious wire transfers adding up to nearly $1.1 billion flowing in and out of just one of Epstein's bank accounts and hundreds of millions through other accounts.",
      "Wyden sent a letter this week to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the Justice Department to further investigate Epstein's financial transactions and whether several big banks turned a blind eye to suspicious transfers. The senator's office said the attorney general has not yet responded. The Justice Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"The Treasury Department's Epstein file contains significant information on the sources of funding behind Epstein's sex trafficking activities,\" Wyden wrote. \"Epstein clearly had access to enormous financing to operate his sex trafficking network, and the details on how he got the cash to pay for it are sitting in a Treasury Department filing cabinet.\"",
      "Seeking testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking testimony from Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",

    "story": [
      "Wisconsin's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, announced Thursday that he will not seek a third term in 2026, creating the first open race for governor in the battleground state in 16 years.",
      "It will be Wisconsin's highest profile race next year, as Democrats also angle to take control of the Legislature thanks to redrawn election maps that are friendlier to the party. They are also targeting two congressional districts as Democrats nationwide try to retake the House.",
      "The Legislature has been under Republican control since 2011, and some Democrats had hoped that Evers, 73, would run for a third term to give him a chance to potentially work with a Democratic-controlled one.",
      "In a video announcing his decision, Evers said he was \"damn proud\" of working 50 years in public service. But he said it was time to focus on his family.",
      "\"For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service,\" Evers said. \"They're my world and I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together.\"",
      "Evers has drawn the ire of President Trump's administration, and his tenure has been marked by his often contentious relationship with the Legislature.",
      "Before Evers even took office, Republicans convened a lame-duck session to pass a package of laws to weaken his power.",
      "Evers angered Republicans during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when he ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close, issued a statewide mask mandate and tried, unsuccessfully, to delay the state's April presidential primary.",
      "Republicans broke with tradition to reject 21 Evers appointees. They also blocked many of his proposals, including expanding Medicare, legalizing marijuana and spending more on child care, K-12 schools and higher education.",
      "Evers used his broad veto powers to stop Republicans from enacting a wide range of conservative priorities, including making voting requirements more strict, expanding gun rights, growing the private school voucher program and making abortions more difficult to obtain.",
      "But Evers did work with Republicans to pass the most recent state budget, which included $1.5 billion in tax cuts prioritized by the GOP and more funding for both K-12 special education and the University of Wisconsin. Evers also worked with Republicans to keep the Brewers in Milwaukee and funnel more money to local governments.",
      "Evers pushed for the redrawing of Wisconsin's legislative boundary lines, which the state Supreme Court ordered after liberal justices gained a majority in 2023.",
      "The maps drawn by Republicans, which had been in place for more than a decade, were widely regarded as among the most gerrymandered in the country. The new maps drawn by Evers are more favorable to Democrats and helped them pick up seats in last November's election. Democrats are optimistic that they can win control of at least one legislative chamber next year.",
      "Evers waited until after he signed the state budget before making his retirement announcement.",
      "\"I promised you when I ran for this office that I'd always work to do the right thing, that I'd always give it to you straight, and that I'd always try to be a governor for all of Wisconsin. And I work every day to keep those promises. That'll never change,\" he said.",
      "The open race is sure to attract several Democratic and Republican candidates. Democrats mentioned as potential candidates include Attorney General Josh Kaul, Lt. Gov. Sarah Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.",
      "Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and suburban Milwaukee businessman Bill Berrien are running as Republicans. Others, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, are considering it.",
      "The last open race for governor was in 2010, when Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle, similar to Evers, opted not to seek a third term. Republican Scott Walker won that year and served two terms before Evers defeated him in 2018.",
      "The only Wisconsin governor to be elected to a third four-year term was Republican Tommy Thompson, who served from 1986 to 2001. He resigned midway through his fourth term.",
      "Evers won the gubernatorial race in 2018 by little more than a percentage point. In 2022, he fended off a challenge from Trump-endorsed Tim Michels.",
      "Before being elected governor, Evers worked for 10 years as state superintendent of education after a career as a teacher and school administrator.",
      "Evers positioned himself as a folksy governor who would sprinkle the occasional mild swear word into his comments and other Midwestern colloquialisms such as \"holy mackerel\" and \"folks.\" His mild-mannered demeanor stood in stark contrast to Trump and other political firebrands.",
      "\"I think he is the most quintessential Wisconsin politician I've ever seen,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been in elected office since 1991.",
      "Evers went viral during the 2024 Democratic National Convention when he \u2014 surrounded by a group of cheesehead-wearing supporters \u2014 said he was \"jazzed as hell\" to cast votes for Kamala Harris.",
      "After winning reelection in 2022, Evers noted that he is frequently described as boring, but said: \"As it turns out, boring wins.\"",
      "The Democratic Governors Association issued a statement Thursday, calling his governorship \"transformative for Wisconsin,\" and adding he \"successfully passed fair electoral maps after years of extreme partisan gerrymandering, challenged Wisconsin's pre-Civil War abortion ban, funded public schools for the next four hundred years with a stroke of his pen, and cut taxes by over $1.4 billion.\"",

      "Two-time Grammy Award-winning musician Chuck Mangione, who achieved international success in 1977 with his jazz-flavored single \"Feels So Good\" and later became a voice actor on the animated TV comedy \"King of the Hill,\" has died. He was 84.",
      "Mangione died at his home in Rochester, New York, on Tuesday in his sleep, his attorney, Peter S. Matorin of Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP, told CBS News. The musician had been retired since 2015.",
      "Perhaps his biggest hit \u2014\u00a0\"Feels So Good\"\u00a0\u2014 is a staple on most smooth-jazz radio stations and has been called one of the most recognized melodies since \"Michelle\" by the Beatles. It hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top of the Billboard adult contemporary chart.",
      "\"It identified for a lot of people a song with an artist, even though I had a pretty strong base audience that kept us out there touring as often as we wanted to, that song just topped out there and took it to a whole other level,\" Mangione told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2008.",
      "He followed that hit with \"Give It All You Got,\" commissioned for the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, and he performed it at the closing ceremony.",
      "Mangione, a flugelhorn and trumpet player and jazz composer, released more than 30 albums during a career in which he built a sizable following after recording several albums, doing all the writing.",
      "He won his first Grammy Award in 1977 for his album \"Bellavia,\" which was named in honor of his mother. Another album, \"Friends and Love,\" was also Grammy-nominated, and he earned a best original score Golden Globe nomination and a second Grammy for the movie \"The Children of Sanchez.\"",
      "Mangione introduced himself to a new audience when he appeared on the first several seasons of \"King of the Hill,\" appearing as a commercial spokesman for Mega Lo Mart, where \"shopping feels so good.\"",
      "Mangione, brother of jazz pianist Gap Mangione, with whom he partnered in The Jazz Brothers, started his career as a bebop jazz musician heavily inspired by Dizzy Gillespie.",
      "\"He also was one of the first musicians I saw who had a rapport with the audience by just telling the audience what he was going to play and who was in his band,\" Mangione told the Post-Gazette.",
      "Mangione grew up in Rochester and was a graduate of Benjamin Franklin High School, CBS affiliate WROC reported. He earned a bachelor's degree from the Eastman School of Music - where he would eventually return as director of the school's jazz ensemble - and left home to play with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.",
      "\"Chuck Mangione was a larger-than-life composer, trumpet and flugelhorn player, band-leader, recording artist and mentor,\" Bob Sneider, an Eastman Jazz faculty member who toured with Mangione, said in a statement. \"He inspired generations of kids to play instruments in a variety of musical styles.\"",
      "He donated his signature brown felt hat and the score of his Grammy-winning single \"Feels So Good,\" as well as albums, songbooks and other ephemera from his long and illustrious career to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in 2009.",
      "That same year, two of Mangione's bandmates were among 50 people killed when Colgan Air Flight 3407\u00a0crashed in Buffalo. Gerry Niewood and Coleman Mellett were on the plane that was headed to Buffalo Niagara International Airport from Newark, N.J. \u00a0When it crashed, killing all 40 people on board and one person on the ground.",

      "Ryan Routh, the man charged with trying to assassinate President Trump last year in South Florida, can represent himself during his trial, a federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh's request to represent himself but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel.",
      "Earlier in the week, the federal public defenders had asked to be taken off the case, saying Routh had refused repeated attempts to meet with them.",
      "Routh, 59, is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot Mr. Trump as he played golf.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. He has also pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "The judge told Routh earlier this month that she doesn't intend to delay the Sept. 8 start date of his trial, even if she lets him represent himself. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.",
      "In a June 29 letter to the judge, Routh said he and his attorneys were \"a million miles apart\" and that they were refusing to answer his questions. He also suggested in the same letter that he could be used in a prisoner exchange with Iran, China, North Korea or Russia.",
      "\"I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\" Routh wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, the federal public defender's office filed a motion for termination of appointment of counsel, saying \"the attorney-client relationship is irreconcilably broken.\" Attorneys said Routh refused to meet with them for a scheduled in-person meeting Tuesday morning at the federal detention center in Miami. They said Routh has refused six attempts to meet with their team.",
      "\"It is clear that Mr. Routh wishes to represent himself, and he is within his Constitutional rights to make such a demand,\" the motion said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "The incident followed another attempted assassination, last July, which took place at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Mr.\u00a0 Trump and two others were injured, and one man, Corey Comperatore, was killed when a gunman, Thomas Crooks, fired shots. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.",

      "Pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan has died, police and World Wrestling Entertainment said. He was 71.",
      "First responders were called to the Clearwater Beach, Florida, home of Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea,  around 9:50 a.m. Thursday, police said.",
      "\"The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest,\" the Clearwater Police Department said in a statement. He was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.",
      "\"There were no signs of foul play or suspicious activity,\" Maj. Nate Burnside told reporters.",
      "Hogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history. He was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.",
      "He won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.",
      "\"One of pop culture's most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan's family, friends, and fans,\" WWE said in\u00a0a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Hulkamania,\" as the energy he created was called, started running wild in the mid-1980s and pushed professional wrestling into the mainstream. He was a flag-waving American hero with the horseshoe mustache, red and yellow gear and massive arms he called his \"24-inch pythons.\"",
      "Hogan was also a celebrity outside the wrestling world, appearing in numerous movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, \"Hogan Knows Best.\"",
      "In recent years, Hogan added his celebrity to politics. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, he merged classic WWE maneuvers with then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric to passionately endorse him for president.",
      "\"Let Trumpamania run wild brother! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America great again!\" Hogan shouted into the raucous crowd.",
      "He ripped off a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of himself on a motorcycle to reveal a bright red Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath. Trump stood to applaud the move.",
      "\"We lost a great friend today, the 'Hulkster,'\" President Trump wrote on his social media site Thursday.",
      "He praised Hogan's speech at the RNC, calling it \"absolutely electric\" and \"one of the highlights of the entire week.\"",
      "\"He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Hogan lately began to invest in alternatives to theatrical, professional wrestling, announcing plans in April to serve as the first commissioner for the Real American Freestyle organization, which describes itself as \"the first unscripted pro wrestling\" league in the world. The first event is Aug. 30 at Cleveland State University.",
      "\"The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,\" Hogan said. \"People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.\"",
      "Hogan first became champion in what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, and pro wrestling took off from there. His popularity helped lead to the creation of the annual WrestleMania event in 1985, when he teamed up with Mr. T to beat \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the main event.",
      "He slammed and beat Andre the Giant at WrestleMania III in 1987, and the WWF gained momentum. His feud with the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage \u2014 perhaps his greatest rival \u2014 carried pro wrestling even further.",
      "Hogan was a central figure in what is known as the Monday Night Wars. The WWE and World Championship Wrestling were battling for ratings supremacy in 1996. Hogan tilted things in WCW's favor with the birth of the Hollywood Hogan character and the formation of the New World Order, a villainous stable that put WCW ahead in the ratings.",
      "He returned to the WWE in 2002 and became a champion again. His match with The Rock at WrestleMania X8, a loss during which fans cheered for his \"bad guy\" character, was seen as a passing of the torch.",
      "Hogan was perhaps as well known for his larger-than-life personality as he was his in-ring exploits. He was beloved for his \"promos\" \u2014 hype sessions he used to draw fans into matches. He often would play off his interviewer, \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, starting his interviews off with, \"Well, lemme tell ya something, Mean Gene!\"",
      "In 2016, a Florida jury awarded Hogan $115 million in a lawsuit against Gawker Media and then added $25 million in punitive damages. Hogan sued after Gawker in 2012 posted a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife. He contended the post violated his privacy.",
      "Hogan smiled and wore black throughout the three-week trial.",
      "\"Everywhere I show up, people treat me like I'm still the champ,\" he said of the support from fans.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 14:00:59 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration had planned to eliminate all paper checks by Sept. 30. Now the agency says it will continue issuing checks as needed.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration said it will continue issuing paper checks to the retirement program's beneficiaries, backing away from a previously announced plan to switch all payments to electronic deposits after Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration told CBS MoneyWatch it would continue issuing paper checks for beneficiaries, including recipients of retirement and disability benefits, who have no other means of getting\u00a0payments. But the program will also emphasize the advantages of electronic transfers to its roughly 70 million beneficiaries in an effort to encourage check recipients to switch, a Social Security spokesperson added.",
      "The about-face comes after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0on July 14 that it would phase out paper checks beginning in October, citing the advantages of electronic deposits including faster payment processing and enhanced security. Eliminating paper also saves the federal government money, with checks costing 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer, the agency said at the time.",
      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",
      "She added that Bisignano \"made a commitment that no one will be left behind and that people who have access to paper checks will get access to paper checks.\"",
      "Millions of people in the U.S. are \"unbanked,\" meaning they lack traditional bank accounts, often because they believe they don't earn enough to qualify for an account or are worried about costs or other issues, according to Bankrate. Typically, these people rely on check-cashing services or other non-bank financial companies, such as PayPal or Venmo, rather than banks.",
      "About one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, according to the AARP. People who are underbanked may have a bank account but still primarily rely on alternative banking services, like check cashing establishments, to handle their money.",
      "Focus on customer service",
      "Warren also said she addressed other issues with Bisignano, including concerns that a major workforce reduction at the Social Security Administration this year could affect customer service.",
      "The senator said Bisignano agreed to her request that the agency's inspector general conduct an independent audit to assess the state of customer service at SSA, such as call wait times and how many Social Security recipients are able to reach a human employee when they call for help.",
      "\"More accurate data is absolutely essential to oversight, to holding the Social Security Administration accountable to the job they are required to do,\" Warren said.",
      "On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said\u00a0customer service is improving, noting that the agency has reduced its phone response time to an average of 18 minutes in 2025, down from 30 minutes in 2024.",
      "\"Commissioner Bisignano had a productive meeting with Senator Warren where he presented improved customer service metrics that are currently being realized on the phone, in field offices and online,\" a Social Security Administration spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Senator Warren reacted positively to many of the indicators, specifically lower phone and field office wait times, the reduction of the disability claims backlog by 25% and the speed at which the SSFA payments were completed \u2014 give months ahead of schedule.\"",

      "One of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves, told her roommates she saw a man she didn't recognize staring at her when she took her dog outside. Another time, the residents came home to find the door open, loose on its hinges. They grabbed golf clubs to arm themselves against a possible intruder.",
      "Those details were included in hundreds of documents released by police within hours of Kohberger being sentenced to life in prison Wednesday for the brutal stabbing murders of Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin early Nov. 13, 2022.",
      "It remains unclear whether the strange happenings had anything to do with the killings. But the documents do illustrate the frenzied efforts by law enforcement to follow every possible lead to find and convict Kohberger.",
      "Here's a look at some information from the documents:",
      "Strange happenings at house and mention of a stalker",
      "Bethany Funke was one of two roommates to survive the night of the stabbings. In interviews after the murders, she told police that about a month earlier, Goncalves had taken her dog, Murphy, outside when she saw an unknown man \"up above their house to the south,\" staring at her.",
      "It was concerning enough that Goncalves \"told everyone\" about it and called her roommates to ask if they'd be home soon, Funke said.",
      "A friend of Goncalves also told police that when they had lunch on Sept. 11, 2022, she made references to having a stalker, according to the documents.",
      "The friend \"thought Kaylee said something about receiving something in the mail. Some of the other friends at the lunch thought Kaylee also mentioned getting a strange message through Facebook messenger,\" the police report says.",
      "On Nov. 4, nine days before the attack, the roommates came home at 11 a.m. to find the door open, loose on its hinges, as the wind blew. Goncalves was away at the time. Kernodle's father fixed the door, Funke reported.",
      "On Nov. 13, police found a gruesome scene. Blood pooled on bed comforters, covered floors and was splattered on walls. One the victims, Kernodle, had extensive defensive wounds; in her room \"it was obvious an intense struggle had occurred,\" one officer wrote.",
      "Detailing the investigation's steps",
      "Tips poured in. A staff member at Walmart told police that two to three weeks earlier, a white, college-age male had come in looking for a black ski mask that would cover his face. People who saw online feeds of some of the victims at a food truck offered their thoughts about a possible perpetrator, and investigators also looked into leads about bar-goers they had seen earlier in the night or an Uber driver they frequently used, the documents show.",
      "A woman who lived nearby told police that in either August or September 2022, she and her daughter saw a man in their yard who \"looked nervous.\" She said she was almost certain it was Kohberger.",
      "Officers eventually identified Kohberger \u2014 a doctoral student in criminology at nearby Washington State University \u2014 using a DNA sample found on a knife sheath at the crime scene. Earlier this month, prosecutors revealed that DNA found on a discarded Q-tip proved to be a crucial breakthrough in the case.",
      "They tracked his movements that night with cellphone data, obtained online shopping records showing he had purchased a military-style knife, and linked him to a car that repeatedly drove by the students' house.",
      "The documents include memos memorializing the subpoenas or warrants they served seeking records and the responses to those requests. Investigators served a warrant on the dating app Tinder, looking for accounts Kohberger might have created with certain emails and which might link him to his victims.",
      "No such evidence emerged, and the motive for the killings remains a mystery.",
      "Kohberger spoke with police \u2014 briefly",
      "Kohberger was arrested at his parents' home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, about six weeks after the killings. He was taken to a state police barracks to be interviewed by officers from the Moscow police department, Idaho State Police and the FBI.",
      "They chatted about the Washington State football team, Kohberger's doctorate studies in criminal justice, his required duties to be a teaching assistant while in college, and why he wanted to become a professor.",
      "Kohberger eventually said he understood they were engaging in small talk, but he would appreciate if the officers explained what they wanted. One detective told him it was because of what had happened in Moscow. Asked if he knew what had transpired, he replied, \"Of course.\"",
      "Did he want to talk about it? \"Well, I think I would need a lawyer,\" Kohberger replied.",
      "He continued speaking, though \u2014 asking what specific questions they had and asking if his parents and dog were OK following his arrest.",
      "Kohberger finally said he would like to speak to an attorney, and police ended the interview because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right.",
      "Police at the time said they\u00a0swabbed Bryan Kohberger's DNA\u00a0and seized a silver flashlight, four \"medical-style gloves,\" a white Arizona Jean Co. T-shirt, a black Champion sweatshirt, a pair of black-and-white size 13 Nike shoes, black Under Armour socks, black Under Armour shorts and black Under Armour boxers.",
      "Behind bars with Kohberger",
      "A man incarcerated at the Latah County Jail who was once housed next to Kohberger's cell told a detective Sept. 16, 2024, that Kohberger would often question him about his past criminal offenses and why he was in the maximum security wing of the facility.",
      "The man said Kohberger's habits annoyed him, including how he washed his hands dozens of times each day and spent 45 minutes to an hour in the shower. He said Kohberger stayed awake almost all night and would only take a nap during the day.",
      "Kohberger\u00a0pleaded guilty earlier this month to the murders\u00a0as part of a plea deal that spared him\u00a0from the death penalty. He was in the courtroom Wednesday wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and listened as the families of the victims confronted him with powerful statements.",

    "story": [
      "Police have made an arrest in Arizona four decades after the cold-case murder and sexual assault of two teenagers who were attacked in a parked car in Northern California, officials said Wednesday.",
      "On Dec. 19, 1984, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office was called to an incident in Burney, California, by the California Highway Patrol. They found two 18-year-old victims, a male and a female, according to a news release from the office. The male victim, identified by police as Terrance Arndt, had sustained a gunshot wound. He was transported to an area hospital but died from his injuries. The female victim, who police did not identify, had been sexually assaulted.",
      "An investigation found that Arndt and the female victim were parked in Arndt's car talking near an area high school when an unknown person pulled up in a vehicle. Arndt tried to protect the female victim, but was shot. The female victim was then assaulted and left for dead, Shasta County Sheriff Michael L. Johnson\u00a0said in a news conference. After the suspect left the scene, she drove Arndt's car for help until she was able to reach police. Johnson said that the crime \"rocked the community for many years.\"",
      "An extensive investigation followed, Johnson said, including \"thousands of hours\" of case work. Detectives collected forensic evidence from the female victim's clothes, according to forensic genetic genealogy company Othram, and investigators also developed a DNA profile of the suspect. A man was arrested and charged in connection with the case, Othram said, but later cleared by the DNA profile.",
      "The DNA profile was entered into the Combined DNA Index System, a national database used by law enforcement to compare DNA profiles. There were no matches to any known individuals, Othram said.",
      "In 2024, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office revisited the case using forensic genetic genealogy, Johnson said. That led police to a suspect, identified as Roger Neil Schmidt Sr. Schmidt, now 64, would have been 23 at the time of the crime, police said. He also \"strongly resembled\" a sketch developed based on an account from the female victim, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Police determined that Schmidt was currently living in Tucson, Arizona, but had lived in Burney, California, in 1984. Detectives from the Shasta County Sheriff's Office traveled to the city to coordinate with the Tucson Police Department and obtain a search warrant. Police were able to collect a DNA sample from Schmidt and confirm that it matched the profile.",
      "Schmidt was arrested in Tucson on Saturday and charged with murder and sexual assault, police said. He made his first court appearance on Monday, CBS affiliate KOLD reported. He was in a wheelchair and using an oxygen tank.",
      "Schmidt is expected to be extradited to Shasta County, the sheriff's office said. Johnson said he hopes the arrest brings closure to the female victim and Arndt's family. He said that the families were informed of the arrest before the news conference.",
      "According to SFGate, Arndt was a star athlete at Burney High School before enrolling at Shasta College in Redding, California, where he lived at the time of his murder.",
      "\"The resolution to this case is a bit bittersweet for us,\" Johnson said. \"Although it's a monumental accomplishment for the investigators, for the agency and the closure of having a suspect in custody, it doesn't negate the fact that there is a family and families that have been forever impacted and will forever live with the trauma and the aftermath that was left behind for them.\"",

The trigger for the clashes was a mine explosion along the border on Wednesday that wounded five Thai soldiers and led Bangkok to withdraw its ambassador to Cambodia and expel Cambodia's.",
      "Thailand's foreign ministry said all land border crossings with Cambodia were sealed and communities near the frontier had been evacuated. It urged all Thai nationals to leave Cambodia.",
      "The Southeast Asian neighbors have longstanding border disputes that periodically flare along their 500-mile frontier and usually result in brief confrontations that sometimes involve exchanges of gunfire. But relations have deteriorated sharply since a confrontation in May that killed a Cambodian soldier, and Thursday's clashes were far bigger in scale and intensity than usual.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Thailand noted reports \"of fighting, including rocket and artillery fire, between Cambodian and Thai forces along the border,\" and it said the Thai government was \"ordering the evacuation of certain areas.\"",
      "\"U.S. citizens living or traveling near the Thailand-Cambodia border should follow direction from Thai security services and consult local government authorities for the latest information,\" the embassy said.",
      "\"The United States is gravely concerned by reports of the escalating fighting along the Thailand-Cambodia border.  We are particularly alarmed by reports of harm to innocent civilians,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Thursday in a statement. \"We express our deepest condolences on the loss of life.  We strongly urge the immediate cessation of attacks, protection of civilians, and peaceful settlement of disputes.\"",
      "The first clash Thursday morning happened in an area near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple along the border of Thailand's Surin province and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province.",
      "A video from the Thai side showed people running from their homes and hiding in a concrete bunker as explosions sounded.",
      "The Thai army said its forces heard a drone before seeing six armed Cambodian soldiers moving closer to Thai military positions at the border. It said Thai soldiers tried to shout at them to defuse the situation, but the Cambodian side started to open fire.",
      "Cambodia's Defense Ministry, however, said Thailand deployed a drone first before opening fire, and that Cambodia \"acted strictly within the bounds of self-defense, responding to an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops that violated our territorial integrity.\"",
      "Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet wrote to the current president of the U.N. Security Council asking for an urgent meeting \"to stop Thailand's aggression.\"",
      "The Thai army said it later launched airstrikes on military targets in Cambodia, while the Cambodian Defense Ministry said the Thai jets dropped bombs on a road near the ancient Preah Vihear temple, which has been the site of some of the most prominent and violent past conflicts between the countries.",
      "Thailand's Foreign Ministry accused Cambodia of attacking both military and non-military sites in Thailand, including a hospital.",

      "Cambodia released no details on deaths or injuries on its side.",
      "On Wednesday, Thailand withdrew its ambassador to Cambodia and expelled the Cambodian ambassador to protest the mine blast that wounded its soldiers.",
      "Thai authorities alleged the mines were newly laid along paths that both sides had agreed were supposed to be safe. They said the mines were Russian-made and not of a type employed by Thailand's military.",

      "Cambodia also downgraded diplomatic relations, recalling all Cambodian staff on Thursday from its embassy in Bangkok.",
      "The border dispute in May that resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier has had political fallout in Thailand. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra came under fire for being too fawning in a phone call with her Cambodian counterpart when she tried to defuse the situation. She has since been suspended from office pending an investigation into possible ethics violations over the matter.",

      "\"Given its historic commitment to a just and sustainable peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the state of Palestine,'' Macron posted. \"Peace is possible.\"",
      "He also posted a letter he sent to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas about the decision.",

      "\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel \u2014 not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" he said.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.",
      "France is the biggest and most powerful European country to recognize Palestine. More than 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state, however, the U.S. is not among them.",
      "France has Europe's largest Jewish population and the largest Muslim population in Western Europe, and fighting in the Middle East often spills over into protests or other tensions in France.",
      "France's foreign minister is co-hosting a conference at the U.N. next week about a two-state solution.

    "summary": "When the former Canadian junior hockey players were charged in early 2024\u200b, four of them played in the NHL.",
    "story": [
      "An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team on Thursday in their sexual assault case, saying the complainant's allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges.",
      "Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia said prosecutors could not meet the onus of proof for the charges against Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube and Callan Foote.",
      "The players' identities were made public when they were charged in early 2024. At the time, four of them played in the NHL \u2014 Dube for the Calgary Flames, Hart for the Philadelphia Flyers, and McLeod and Foote for the New Jersey Devils. Formenton had previously played for the Ottawa Senators before joining a Swiss team. All went on indefinite leave and none is on an NHL roster or has an active contract with a team in the league.",
      "All five players had pleaded not guilty to sexual assault in an encounter that took place in a London, Ontario, hotel room in the early hours of June 19, 2018. Years of speculation regarding the allegations \u2014 fueled by a lawsuit settlement, parliamentary hearings and revived investigations by the police and Hockey Canada, along with an NHL investigation \u2014 all preceded a complex trial earlier this year that included a mistrial and the dismissal of the jury, leaving the verdict to Carroccia.",
      "Carroccia explained her reasoning for the acquittals in detail over the course of five hours, highlighting the complainant's \"tendency to blame others\" for inconsistencies in her allegations. She also said the woman went to \"great lengths\" to point out that she was really drunk through the course of the night, but that is not supported by surveillance video from a bar and hotel that night and the testimony of others.",
      "McLeod was also acquitted \u2014 and pleaded not guilty \u2014 to a separate count of being a party to the offense, an unusual application of a charge that is more typically seen in murder cases.",
      "The players, who are now between the ages of 25 and 27, were in London at the time for a gala and golf tournament marking their championship victory.",
      "The woman testified in May that she was naked, drunk and scared when four of the men showed up unexpectedly in her room at the Delta Hotel London Armouries and felt the only \"safe\" option was to do what they wanted. Prosecutors argued the players did what they wanted without taking steps to ensure she was voluntarily consenting to sexual acts.",
      "\"I made the choice to dance with them and drink at the bar, I did not make the choice to have them do what they did back at the hotel,\" she testified.",
      "Defense attorneys cross-examined her for days and suggested she actively participated in or initiated sexual activity because she wanted a \"wild night.\" Two short videos of the complainant taken by McLeod the night of the encounter were played in court. In one, the woman says it was \"all consensual,\" though she told the court that wasn't how she truly felt.",
      "Protesters gathered outside a packed London courthouse on Thursday morning, holding signs that signaled support for the complainant.",
      "The Associated Press and other news organizations do not identify sexual assault accusers unless they have granted permission to do so, which she has not.",
      "The public didn't learn of the allegations for years. Police closed their initial investigation without charges in early 2019, but the complainant sued Hockey Canada in 2022. The organization settled the lawsuit amid intense scrutiny that cost it sponsors, but police reopened their investigation.",
      "The NHL launched its own investigation in 2022. Officials pledged to release the findings, though Commissioner Gary Bettman said in February that would depend on what the league can say given the legal proceedings.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump is due to arrive Friday for what the White House is calling a \"working visit\" to Scotland. It's expected to include a mix of both personal time, and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",

Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the polices he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been\u00a0 organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",

But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III.

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",
      "AFP  \n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "She issued a statement under the headline: \"Make Agriculture Great Again Trade Wins.\"",
      "\"American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years,\" Rollins said. \"Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines.

They won't take any of our beef. They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now.\"",

      "\"I want to see the science and it should be predicated on science. I'm suspicious of the speed at which this has been done,\" Littleproud told reporters.",
      "\"We need to give confidence to the industry, but also to you (the public): this is not just about animal welfare, this is about human welfare, this is about BSE potentially coming into this country and having a human impact, so I think it's important the government's very transparent about the science and I don't think it's even beyond the question to have an independent panel review that science to give confidence to everybody,\" he added.",
      "Around 70% of Australian beef is exported. Producers fear that export market would vanish overnight if diseases including mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease infected Australian cattle.",
      "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been only six BSE cases in U.S. cattle since the major international outbreak of the disease \u2014 which was centered in the U.K. and other European nations \u2014 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of those cows was imported from Canada and believed to have been infected there, and the other five, \"were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed,\" the CDC says.",
      "Will Evans, chief executive of Cattle Australia who represents more than 52,000 grass-fed beef producers across the nation, said he was confident the agriculture department had taken a cautious approach toward U.S. imports.",
      "\"The department's undertaken a technical scientific assessment and we have to put faith in them. They've made this assessment themselves. They've said: 'We've looked at this, we've looked at the best science, this is a decision that we feel comfortable with,'\" Evans said.",
      "\"When you have a $75 billion (Australian $50 billion) industry relying on them not making this mistake, I'm sure they've been very cautious in their decision-making,\" he added.",
      "But Australian demand for U.S. beef is likely to remain low despite the eased restrictions, for reasons including a relatively weak Australian dollar.",
      "Will Australians buy more U.S. beef?",
      "Evans, of Cattle Australia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he wasn't worried about the new government policy flooding Australia's domestic market with American beef. He said the U.S. domestic market currently relieds on imports of Australian beef, which he said was about 50 cents cheaper than U.S. beef per pound.",
      "\"The likelihood of them (U.S.) turning around and looking to Australia as a really high value market [to export to] is very low,\" he said. \"If I was an exporter of U.S. beef, I would be looking at Japan, Korea and China as being really viable and valuable markets. I don't really think Australia rates highly on that list.\"",
      "Simon Quilty, an analyst with Global Agri Trends, agreed that it was unlikely Australian consumers would soon see U.S. beef in on their grocery stores shelves.",
      "\"Honestly, if there is a pound of U.S. beef shipped to Australia in the next three years, I will be gobsmacked,\" he told ABC.",
      "Beef prices have been rising in the U.S. for years, due to factors including prolonged drought and shrinking domestic herd numbers. The average price of a pound of ground beef in the U.S. rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

    "story": [
      "Dewey Yopp, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer, was sent to Afghanistan in 2002 to train up a new Afghan army during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. He met Amir, his then-18-year-old Afghan translator, at the airport on his first day there, and says Amir went on to save his life four times.",
      "\"Amir dragged me, under fire, to a medevac point,\" Yopp told CBS News of one of those instances.",

      "\"If someone saves your life, your souls are bound together for eternity,\" Yopp said. \"He's like a son to me, really.\"",
      "Three years later, Amir's visa was approved, and he and his family were given green cards. They came to the U.S. and settled in Kentucky, reuniting with Yopp 22 years after they first met in Afghanistan.",

Despite he and his family having green cards, he still fears being sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "Amir risked Taliban retaliation to help American soldiers, because work in Afghanistan at the time was scarce and the prospect of safety abroad was enticing. He told CBS News the promise that was made to him in return for risking his life was, \"Your family will go to America. This was promised with all who work with U.S.\"",
      "Amir said he went into hiding for years after his service, feeling betrayed by the U.S., until Yopp stepped in to fulfill America's pledge and helped secure him his visa. Thousands of veterans of the Afghanistan war across the country have taken it upon themselves to help their translators and other Afghan allies come safely to the U.S. and settle here. But Amir says it is not the job of veterans to fulfill the vow of protection the government previously made to them.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has repeatedly targeted\u00a0Afghan refugees, stopping flights with Afghan allies from arriving, freezing resettlement services, putting Afghanistan on the travel ban list, and ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Afghan refugees. Yopp says it is a \"moral injury\" to veterans to see this happen to those who helped them during the war.",
      "As part of the administration's efforts to end the TPS program, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0has claimed\u00a0that Afghanistan is now safe for Afghans to return to, a point Amir disputes.",
      "\"OK, if Afghanistan is safe, why are you saying to your citizens, 'Do not go to Afghanistan?'\" Amir said in reference to the State Department's \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Afghanistan. \"For me, [it's] safe, but for you, [it's] not safe? I'm not sure.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 19:49:52 -0400",
    "summary": "The island nation of Vanuatu prevailed in its landmark request to legally compel countries to cut emissions and compensate places facing impacts from climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Republic of Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation of 320,000 people, has led a growing effort since 2021 to compel the United Nations to answer one of the most crucial legal questions related to climate change: Can polluters be held legally accountable for the harm they've caused as a result of releasing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere?",
      "The short answer is: yes. Fifteen judges who make up the International Court of Justice, located at The Hague in the Netherlands, issued a unanimous advisory opinion saying countries \"have a duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence and to use all means at their disposal to prevent activities carried out within their jurisdiction or control from causing significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.\"",
      "The court further stated that existing environmental treaties, international human rights law, and participation in the United Nations further compels countries to do everything possible to protect the climate. Any wrongful act that violates these agreements must be immediately stopped, followed by \"full reparations\" and compensation made to the injured parties.",
      "\"Vanuatu looks forward to collaborating with other States on implementing the Court's decision,\" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister of climate change and environment, said in a statement. \"A victory in the world's highest court is just the beginning. Success will depend on what happens next through coordinated efforts across diplomacy, politics, litigation, and advocacy to turn this moment into a true turning point.\"",
      "For Vanuatu, a country that comprises 83 islands with a combined size roughly the same as Connecticut, the decision is monumental. Officials said the country was responsible for less than 0.0004% of global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1962 and 2022, but experiences disproportionate impacts of climate change.",
      "In addition to its average temperature rising, Vanuatu is seeing more severe and intense tropical cyclones. In 2023, it was hit by three cyclones that were Category 4 or higher, impacting nearly 200,000 residents and costing the country more than $400 million in economic damages. The western tropical Pacific Ocean has risen 4-6 inches between 1992-2020, which is particularly dangerous for the country as much of it is low-lying and vulnerable to erosion. All of this, along with increased precipitation and periods of drought, has caused entire communities to be relocated by the government, and the impacts are anticipated to grow more severe.",
      "\"Today, the world's smallest countries have made history,\" Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, said in a statement. \"The ICJ's decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities. It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future. This ruling is a lifeline for Pacific communities on the frontline.\"",
      "While the advisory opinion is not legally binding, environmental organizations and law experts are hopeful that the ruling can set a legal precedent for the thousands of climate change cases around the world that are attempting to hold larger governments and companies accountable for climate pollution.",
      "\"This opinion can serve as a compass for countries who are thinking about how to prioritize justice and prioritize the safety of their citizens while also being in compliance with international law,\" said Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists who worked with the legal teams of seven countries that submitted supporting statements to the court asking for the opinion.",
      "The United States does not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, but it did submit a written statement in March 2024 and participated in oral arguments, arguing that members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris Agreement already compel signatories to address climate change impacts and protects them from accountability for harming the climate.",
      "But Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat has been skeptical of the power of the U.N. convention and the Paris Agreement, saying in a statement that neither are \"generating the actions the world urgently needs fast enough.\" He believes a favorable opinion from the court could \"support vulnerable nations in securing climate finance, technology, and loss and damage support.\"",
      "The court addressed this concern in its opinion and dismissed the legal argument that environmental treaties, like the Paris Agreement, protect polluters from accountability. In fact, the court emphasized that the Paris Agreement imposes strong mitigation and adaptation obligations on all parties and requires them to respond to loss and damages from climate change.",
      "Given that the United States is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, according to international data, the decision to hold large emitters responsible might be concerning, but President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement for a second time earlier this year.",
      "The court called out countries like the United States, saying that nations that are not party to climate treaties but are members of the United Nations must meet \"equivalent obligations under customary international law.\"",
      "The impact of the opinion remains to be seen. \"It's likely not going to have a lot of influence in the United States,\" said Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.",
      "Tigre said that while the decision may not influence domestic court cases in the U.S. and the country can't be sued under the decision, the real impact could be seen internationally. A court in Brazil, for example, could cite the opinion in one of the 135 current climate change cases making its way through its domestic court system.",
      "The U.N. court also pointed out that corporate polluters are open to the advisory opinion, especially if they are based abroad in a country that is party to the U.N. and climate treaties. \"Countries have an obligation to put an end to wrongful acts,\" said Tigre. \"If a country is found to be in breach by giving permits to an oil company, they may need to revoke those permits.\"",
      "Representatives for Vanuatu said the next step is to take the decision back to the U.N. General Assembly to pursue a full resolution to support the implementation of the decision. The opinion will be a primary focus when U.N. countries meet in November for the next climate change conference, known as COP30, in Brazil.",

    "story": [
      "For nearly two decades, no one had spotted the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct, but one sunny morning, Connor Blades lifted a rock in a tiny forest in the eastern Caribbean island and held his breath.",
      "\"After a year of searching, you begin to get a little pessimistic,\" said Blades, project officer with the Ministry of Environment in Barbados.",
      "The snake can fit comfortably on a coin, so it was able to elude scientists for almost 20 years.",
      "Scientifically named Tetracheilostoma carlae, the petite creature is listed as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species when it was last assessed in 2015.",
      "Too tiny to identify with the naked eye, Blades placed it in a small glass jar and added soil, substrate and leaf litter.",
      "Several hours later, in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies, Blades looked at the specimen. It wriggled in the petri dish, making it nearly impossible to identify.",
      "\"It was a struggle,\" Blades recalled, adding that he shot a video of the snake and finally identified it thanks to a still image.",
      "It had pale yellow dorsal lines running through its body, and its eyes were located on the side of its head.",
      "\"I tried to keep a level head,\" Blades recalled, knowing that the Barbados threadsnake looks very much like a Brahminy blind snake, best known as the flower pot snake, which is a bit longer and has no dorsal lines.",
      "On Wednesday, the Re:wild conservation group, which is collaborating with the local environment ministry, announced the rediscovery of the Barbados threadsnake.",
      "\"Rediscovering one of our endemics on many levels is significant,\" said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer for Re:wild who helped rediscover the snake along with Blades. \"It reminds us that we still have something important left that plays an important role in our ecosystem.\"",
      "The Barbados threadsnake has only been seen a handful of times since 1889. It was on a list of 4,800 plant, animal and fungi species that Re:wild described as \"lost to science.\"",
      "There's no information on its population and the most recent record of the snake was a 2005 photograph from near Hillaby town in St. Thomas Parish, according to the IUCN. One of the oldest known records of the species dates back to 1918, and it has only been rarely spotted since then, with a few documentations from 1966, 1997 and 2008, the Switzerland-based conservation organization said.",
      "\"Given the dense human population on Barbados, if the species was simply underrecorded it seems likely that local people would be aware of additional records,\" the IUCN said on its website. \"The lack of records suggests that this species is genuinely rare and restricted.\"",
      "The snake is blind, burrows in the ground, eats termites and ants and lays one single, slender egg. Fully grown, it measures up to four inches.",
      "\"They're very cryptic,\" Blades said. \"You can do a survey for a number of hours, and even if they are there, you may actually not see them.\"",
      "But on March 20 at around 10:30 a.m., Blades and Springer surrounded a jack-in-the-box tree in central Barbados and started looking under rocks while the rest of the team began measuring the tree, whose distribution is very limited in Barbados.",
      "\"That's why the story is so exciting,\" Springer said. \"It all happened around the same time.\"",
      "S. Blair Hedges, a professor at Temple University and director of its center for biology, was the first to identify the Barbados threadsnake. Previously, it was mistakenly lumped in with another species.",
      "In 2008, Hedges' discovery was published in a scientific journal, with the snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae, in honor of his wife.",
      "\"I spent days searching for them,\" Hedges recalled. \"Based on my observations and the hundreds of rocks, objects that I turned over looking for this thing without success, I do think it is a rare species.\"",
      "That was June 2006, and there were only three other such specimens known at the time: two at a London museum and a third at a museum collection in California that was wrongly identified as being from Antigua instead of Barbados, Hedges said.",
      "Hedges said that he didn't realize he had collected a new species until he did a genetic analysis.",
      "\"The aha moment was in the laboratory,\" he said, noting that the discovery established the Barbados threadsnake as the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Hedges then became inundated for years with letters, photographs and emails from people thinking they had found more Barbados threadsnakes. Some of the pictures were of earthworms, he recalled.",
      "\"It was literally years of distraction,\" he said.",
      "Scientists hope the rediscovery means that the Barbados threadsnake could become a champion for the protection of wildlife habitat.",
      "A lot of endemic species on the tiny island have gone extinct, including the Barbados racer, the Barbados skink and a particular species of cave shrimp.",
      "\"I hope they can get some interest in protecting it,\" Hedges said. \"Barbados is kind of unique in the Caribbean for a bad reason: it has the least amount of original forest, outside of Haiti.\""

    "story": [
      "A Delta flight had just begun its takeoff roll at Benito Ju\u00e1rez Mexico City International Airport when a regional jet appeared to fly over the plane and land in front of it on the same runway, forcing the Delta pilots to hit the brakes.",
      "Aeromexico Flight 1691, arriving from the city of Aguascalientes, touched down on Monday as Atlanta-bound Delta flight 590 was accelerating to initiate takeoff at 7:28 a.m. local time, according to Delta and preliminary flight data from the tracking site\u00a0Flightradar24. The data shows that the Delta Boeing 737-800 reached 62 knots, or about 71 miles per hour, before pilots stopped the plane and halted their takeoff.",
      "The Delta pilots exited the runway and returned to the gate, the airline said. The plane received additional fuel and eventually departed for Atlanta at 9:42 a.m. The flight carrying 144 passengers and six crew members landed safely in Atlanta at 3:20 p.m. ET, according to Delta.",
      "\"Because nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people, Delta will fully cooperate with authorities as the circumstances around this flight are investigated.

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 10:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing protests and EU criticism for the first time since Russia invaded, over changes to national anti-corruption agencies.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, widespread protests have taken place across Ukraine \u2014 not against Russia or its President Vladimir Putin, but against Ukraine's own President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's parliament, the Rada.",
      "Late Tuesday night, Zelenskyy signed a bill into law, after it was fast-tracked through the Rada, that gives Ukraine's prosecutor general (roughly equivalent to the U.S. attorney general), more power over two anti-corruption agencies long known for their fierce independence. The prosecutor general is a political appointee, not an elected official.",
      "In the hours before Zelenskyy signed the measure, thousands of people in the capital Kyiv, the western city of Lviv, Dnipro in the east and Odessa in the south made their frustration and fear known, defying martial law bans on mass gatherings to come out and protest. Their concern is rooted in the continued autonomy of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), which for years have sought to combat graft by public officials, regardless of their political affiliation.",
      "Some critics argue the new law is political retribution. In April, Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau charged a former deputy head of Zelenskyy's administration, Andrii Smyrnov, with money laundering and accepting a bribe. Others fear a potential backslide back into some degree of authoritarianism in the country that was previously led by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was known for his close ties to oligarchs.",
      "The 27-nation European Union, which has been a staunch supporter of Zelenskyy and Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, also voiced concern over the changes to the management of the anti-corruption agencies. Demonstrably fighting corruption is crucial to Ukraine's bid to join the EU.",
      "EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos called the vote by Ukraine's parliament \"a serious step back\" in a post on social media, adding that \"independent bodies like NABU & SAPO are essential for Ukraine's EU path. Rule of Law remains in the very center of EU accession negotiations.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to acknowledge the anger in his country over the new legislation, saying in a statement posted on social media after the Rada's vote: \"We all hear what society is saying.\"",
      "\"We see what people expect from state institutions \u2014 ensured justice and the effective functioning of each institution. We discussed the necessary administrative and legislative decisions that would strengthen the work of each institution, resolve existing contradictions, and eliminate threats,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everyone will work together. At the political level, we will provide support.\"",
      "Earlier he had stressed that the two anti-corruption agencies would still \"work,\" but he said they needed to be clear of what he claimed was \"Russian influence.\" He said some major corruption cases had been \"lying dormant\" with the agencies for years without any rational explanation, but offered no explanation of the alleged Russian influence.",
      "New round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      "The Kremlin, meanwhile, confirmed that a third round of direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks would begin in Turkey on Wednesday evening.",
      "\"Our delegation is flying to Istanbul, and indeed negotiations are scheduled to take place there tonight,\" said spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. \"The main topic of discussion will be peace memorandums that were shared during the second round of talks.\"",
      "He said the two sides would discuss further prisoner swaps. Over the past two months, Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners of war, but the negotiations have thus far yielded little hope of a ceasefire in the war.",
      "On Tuesday, Peskov said Moscow did not expect any \"miraculous breakthrough\" in Turkey, calling the two sides \"diametrically opposed.\"",
      "Moscow has demanded a litany of concessions from Ukraine, including that it give up territory Russian troops have seized during the war. Russia currently occupies about a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Putin's government has also demanded that Ukraine abandon its ambitions of joining the EU and the U.S.-led NATO alliance, and even insisted that it should significantly downsize its military and make Russian the official language of Ukraine.",

    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 A classical music concert in Italy has been canceled suddenly following a public backlash over the Russian conductor's support for President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Russian maestro Valery Gergiev had been scheduled to lead an ensemble of Italian musicians and soloists from St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre \u2014 where he's the artistic director \u2014 on July 27 at the Reggia di Caserta, an opulent 18th-century palace near Naples.",
      "Italy's national news agency ANSA said the venue had canceled the concert, offering no explanation. A representative at the Reggia di Caserta confirmed the cancellation to CBS News over the phone.",
      "The move came after criticism from Italian lawmakers, human rights advocates and Russian political dissidents.",
      "Among the most vocal opponents to Italy welcoming Gergiev was Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. She condemned Gergiev's public support for the Kremlin and accused the conductor of using his platform to legitimize Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.",
      "In a message posted on social media, Navalnaya called news of the cancellation, \"not joyful, but good.\"",
      "\"No artist who supports the current dictatorship in Russia should be welcomed in Europe. It is precisely thanks to regime loyalists like Gergiev that Putin tries to promote his image as a 'respectable person' in the West,\" she said. \"It's a small step, but great victories are built from such small steps.\"",
      "Gergiev, once lauded in the West as the \"Wild Man of Music,\" has become a contentious figure in recent years, particularly in Europe, where a range of institutions have sought to distance themselves from artists aligned with the Russian government.",

    "story": [
      "Gaza City\u00a0\u2014 The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said on Tuesday that 21 children had died across the Palestinian territory in the past three days \"due to malnutrition and starvation.\"",
      "\"These deaths were recorded at hospitals in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah and Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis ... over the past 72 hours,\" Mohammed Abu Salmiya told reporters.",
      "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Monday evening that \"the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing\" in Gaza, and that there were growing reports of children and adults exhibiting symptoms of malnutrition.",
      "Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza's remaining functioning hospitals \"every moment,\" adding: \"We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza.\"",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said many people were arriving at Gaza's hospitals \"in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food. Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported ... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",
      "\"Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire. They can't provide much more help for hunger-related symptoms because of food and medicine shortages,\" Khalil al-Deqran, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, told the Reuters news agency. Deqran said there were 600,000 people suffering from malnutrition symptoms such as dehydration and anemia, including 60,000 pregnant women.",
      "After talks to extend a six-week ceasefire broke down, Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza on March 2 this year, allowing no aid in until trucks were again permitted to cross the border in late May. The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "World Food Program director Carl Skau, who visited Gaza City in early July, called the situation \"the worst\" he had ever seen.",
      "Last Sunday, the civil defense agency in Hamas-run Gaza reported that at least three infants had died from \"severe hunger and malnutrition\" over the previous week.",
      "On Monday, the governments of 25 countries, including Israeli and U.S. allies Britain, France, Australia and Canada, urged an immediate end to the war, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the free flow of aid.",
      "In their joint statement, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children\" in Gaza.",
      "The nations also condemned a new system for aid distribution backed by Israel's military that was launched in late May with the support of the Trump administration, but no support from other nations or humanitarian organizations.",
      "The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operations on May 26.",
      "Officially a private effort, the GHF began working in Gaza \u2014 with virtually no information provided about its funding or management \u2014 after Israel imposed the more than two-month blockade on all supplies entering Gaza.",
      "The group's operations, focused around four \"humanitarian hubs\" for food distribution, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.",
      "\"As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near U.N. and other humanitarian organizations' aid convoys,\" U.N. human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told the AFP news agency. He said the agency's data was \"based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organizations.\"",
      "GHF says it has distributed more than 1.4 million boxes of foodstuffs to date and that it adjusts its \"operations in real time to keep people safe and informed, and we stand ready to partner with other organizations to scale up and deliver more meals to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "The U.N. and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles. The group has never commented, despite numerous questions from CBS News, on any links it has with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF \u2014 $30 million in funding \u2014 earlier this month, and called on other organizations and countries to cooperate with the group, saying that, in its view, it provides the only  means of delivering aid in Gaza without the risk of Hamas stealing it.",

      "With the 2026 midterm elections more than a year away, a new Fox News survey finds that while the Republican Party has lost some ground to the Democratic Party on handling key issues, voters are more likely to think the GOP has a clear plan for dealing with the country\u2019s problems.",
      "The survey, released Thursday, finds that by a 10-point margin, more voters think the Republicans have a clear plan for the U.S. than the Democrats: 43% vs. 33%.\u00a0 Still, majorities feel neither the GOP (54%) or the Democrats (64%) have a plan.\u00a0This is about where sentiment was three years ago, the last time the question was asked.",

      "At the same time, the survey shows some significant erosion in the GOP\u2019s handling of key issues compared to the last time Fox asked in 2023, including in areas where they are traditionally preferred.",

Without obvious economic and foreign policy victories, independents and soft Democrats could drift to the left, which could scramble the electoral dynamic heading into 2026.\"",
      "Overall, views of both major political parties are underwater.\u00a0By 2 points, the Republican Party has a slightly better favorable rating (44% favorable) than the Democratic Party (42%), but more than half view both parties negatively (56% and 57% unfavorable, respectively).\u00a0That\u2019s relatively unchanged since April.",
      "Positive views of the Republican Party have shown steady growth since October 2019, while the Democratic Party has been on a downward trajectory, reaching a record low in April (41% favorable).",

      "\"This resolution represents congressional clarity through a simple question: Do we categorically condemn deadly attacks on federal immigration law enforcement? Or not? I know my Republican colleagues back our agents \u2013 it\u2019s the Democrats who need some soul-searching about what they\u2019ve said to encourage and excuse violence in the months they have spent enabling criminal illegals,\" Issa said on the resolution co-led with fellow California Republican Rep. Ken Calvert.",

      "The congressman noted how Democrats have proposed legislation to prevent agents from wearing masks and requiring them to show identification while conducting sweeps throughout the country, which many proponents of the enforcement activity have said poses a safety risk. However, others have said it's a necessary move for government transparency.",

      "\"Law enforcement is certainly accountable and nobody objects to there being some way to differentiate law enforcement officer one from two. But to ask that they be able to be identified is like asking 'Where do they live and what are their family members' names, and what schools do they go to?'

      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft announces the first handheld Xbox device, and it\u2019s primed to take on Nintendo\u2019s best-selling Switch 2.",
      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",

      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully. This ensures you\u2019ll continue to receive updates, features, and support for several years without additional effort.",

      "If you decide to stick with Windows 10 beyond its official support period, having strong third-party antivirus protection becomes even more important. While Microsoft Defender will continue receiving updates until 2028, it may not be enough on its own once the system stops getting core security patches. Installing a reputable antivirus program can help protect your device from malware, phishing, and other threats.",

You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage. Watch out for phone calls, emails, or pop-ups pretending to be from Microsoft offering \"urgent upgrade help.\" Microsoft doesn\u2019t call users out of the blue\u2014these are scams trying to steal your personal info or install malware.

      "Monitoring your blood pressure at home allows you to track readings over time.",
      "We all know staying hydrated is important, but most of us don't actually track how much water we need. The signs of dehydration, like dizziness, fatigue, or confusion, can creep in before you even realize you're in trouble. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already behind. That's what makes the new wearable hydration sensor so valuable. Instead of guessing, this device provides real-time data, allowing you to stay ahead of dehydration, rather than just react to it.",

      "Single-side electrode configuration setup using hydration bioimpedance sensor. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "How the wearable hydration sensor works",
      "Developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, the sensor is designed to detect early signs of dehydration using a method called bioimpedance. This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that. The sensor connects wirelessly to a smartphone app, delivering instant feedback about your hydration level. You don't have to stop what you're doing or wait for lab results. The data is continuous and always available.",
      "Wearable hydration sensor benefits for workouts, jobs, and health",
      "This isn't just cool tech, it's practical. For athletes pushing through workouts in the heat, the sensor could help them avoid fatigue or cramping. For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

Researchers at UC Berkeley transformed this everyday nuisance into a powerful new at-home diagnostic test. This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment. To make home testing accessible, the UC Berkeley team even created a 3D-printed prototype for easy use on your kitchen counter. According to professor Liwei Lin, this innovative approach could transform regular health screening, with no lab visit required.",

      "A man kicking a ball while wearing the e-OPRA bionic knee prosthesis. (MIT)",
      "How the e-OPRA bionic knee for amputees works",
      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs. These muscles \"talk\" to each other, sending signals to the robotic controller, which calculates exactly how the knee should move, mirroring how a real leg works.",
      "Natural movement restored with the bionic knee for amputees",
      "In trials, two patients with this integrated system not only performed better, but they also felt better. They moved faster, climbed stairs with more ease, and avoided obstacles with greater confidence. Most importantly, they felt like the prosthetic was part of their body.",

      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",
      "MIT's bionic knee for amputees driven by lived experience",
      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology. His personal journey powers a lab at MIT that continues to push the boundaries of biomechatronics. And now, that journey may change the lives of above-the-knee amputees worldwide.",

      "We're witnessing the future of\u00a0prosthetics unfold. The bionic knee developed by MIT doesn't just restore function, it redefines it. By merging advanced robotics with the human nervous system, it offers amputees something priceless: the feeling that their body is whole again.",

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",

      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

      "Kinisi built KR1 to thrive in real-world industrial environments. The robot has two arms and hands, which allow it to lift items weighing up to 22 pounds. Thanks to its strong structure and careful engineering, KR1 can retrieve items from high shelves and handle breakable products without damage. It performs these tasks using a wheeled base that allows for smooth, agile movement across standard warehouse floors. Kinisi intentionally avoided complex legged systems to simplify setup and improve stability. KR1 can operate for up to eight hours on a single charge. It features hot-swappable batteries and an auto-docking system that allows for fast recharging with minimal human intervention. These features make it ideal for continuous use in busy fulfillment centers where downtime costs money.",

      "AI-powered warehouse robot learns tasks on the fly",
      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where this humanoid warehouse robot can work beyond logistics",
      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Kinisi KR1 shows that the future of work is already here. This robot lifts like a human, moves like a worker and learns like a fast-thinking employee.

      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

As a result, COBOD supplied two massive, custom-built BOD2 printers. Each machine measures approximately 164 feet long, 90 feet wide, and 49 feet high, about the size of a Boeing 737 hangar.",
      "These industrial printers can build structures up to five stories tall. They enable fast, accurate and cost-effective construction that traditional methods can't match.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Before launching the project, UCC's team of architects, engineers and technicians carried out extensive tests. At a trial site in Doha, they completed more than 100 full-scale component prints using a BOD2 printer. To further prepare for Qatar's desert climate, the team engineered a custom concrete mix designed to cure properly in high heat. Additionally, they developed a special extrusion nozzle to ensure smooth, precise printing.",
      "Construction begins on the first school as part of Qatar\u2019s 3D Printed Schools Project. (UCC Holding)",
      "A project of amazing scale and vision",
      "Each 3D-printed school is a two-story structure that will cover an area of 215,000 square feet. This is a total of 430,000 square feet. When compared to the biggest 3D-printed building we know of, these schools are 40 times bigger. They will be built on 328-by-328-foot plots. Therefore, making this project one of unprecedented scale for the region.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Qatar's desert formations were the inspiration behind the architectural design of the schools. They have wavy walls that look like dunes, something that can only be made possible through 3D printing. Building these unique curved shapes would be too expensive and difficult with traditional construction methods.",
      "UCC Holdings and COBOD construction team's launch Qatar\u2019s 3D Printed Schools Project. (UCC Holding)",
      "How 3D printing enhances sustainability and innovation",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed school project goes beyond architectural innovation; it also marks a major step toward sustainable construction. 3D printing technology reduces material waste by up to 60% compared to traditional building methods. It also minimizes labor requirements and shortens construction timelines, leading to lower overall emissions and energy use.",
      "Moreover, the ability to print complex, curved designs, like the dune-inspired walls of these schools, proves how digital construction methods can unlock new levels of creativity while staying cost-efficient. This approach not only supports Qatar's environmental goals but also sets a new global standard for eco-friendly building design.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed schools will be complete by the end of 2025 and demonstrate just how far construction technology has come. By combining both imaginative design and cutting-edge engineering, this project sets the standard for sustainable, scalable, and future-ready educational infrastructure. Furthermore, it\u2019s an impressive milestone for the region, and a blueprint for how nations worldwide can rethink how buildings are made using the latest technologies.",

      "Amazon website\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin.

      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",

      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong.

      "At an impasse, and unable to move forward with any legislation, Johnson sent the House home early for its August recess. It seems like the Epstein matter has been delayed rather than killed.",
      "But on a broader level, the Rules Committee revolt represents a significant potential power shift in the chamber. For more than 60 years, the panel has been considered an arm of the speakership \u2014 with the majority-party\u2019s leader handpicking its chair and members.",
      "In 1961, the committee, then dominated by the chamber\u2019s bipartisan conservative bloc, was its own rogue source of power. The chairman, Rep. Howard Smith, D-Va., opposed newly elected President John F. Kennedy\u2019s New Frontier agenda \u2014 especially its civil rights plank.",
      "Then-Speaker Sam Rayburn, a Texan, wanted to help Kennedy and forced a crucial vote on the House floor to pack the committee with three additional members \u2014 two Democrats and Illinois Republican Elmer Hoffman \u2014 who were amenable to civil rights.",
      "In a nail-biter that consumed the Capitol and national news pages at the time, Rayburn beat Smith on the floor, 217-212, and broke the committee\u2019s stranglehold. Over decades, the committee not only lost its independence, it became the speaker\u2019s tool.",
      "But conservative Republicans in recent years have forced GOP leaders to appoint more of their own to the ranks of the committee\u2019s roster, and the seeds of that play for power are now blooming.",
      "History suggests that the less power the speaker has, the more likely the House is to pass bills \u2014 or kill them \u2014 based on the sentiments of the majority of House members, rather than the diktats of the majority party\u2019s leadership.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say that the pendulum is swinging back toward independence for the committee, but this week\u2019s activity shows that it is stirring.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Jeffrey Epstein is dead, but the White House can\u2019t seem to kill his story.",
      "President Donald Trump and his aides have settled on silence as a strategy to stamp out criticism of his refusal to release files detailing the federal government's investigation of Epstein, according to a senior administration official and Republicans familiar with the White House's thinking.",
      "For weeks, stories about Epstein, the financier and pal to political luminaries who died by suicide awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019, have been making headlines.",
      "In a break from Trump\u2019s usual crisis communications template \u2014 which emphasizes an all-hands-on-deck approach to defending him on television and on social media \u2014 the Epstein case has been met with more restraint from the White House.",
      "Trump himself has signaled that he doesn\u2019t want members of his administration talking about the matter nonstop, a person close to the White House told NBC News. And White House aides have made it clear that no one in the administration is allowed to talk about Epstein without high-level vetting, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "\"The communications office has to be directly involved in every aspect of this,\" the official said. \"Every 'i' must be dotted, and every 't' must be crossed through us.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s aides would like for the Epstein storm to pass, but they know they can\u2019t keep Trump and other administration officials off television at a time when they are trying to promote his policy wins and agenda.",
      "The senior administration official said White House officials won\u2019t stop making appearances in the media, which will inevitably lead to Epstein questions. But they are still trying to determine how to balance defending Trump on the issue while deflecting inquiries by touting his accomplishments.",
      "That represents a shift of sorts for a president who has generally liked his top deputies and administration officials to robustly defend him to the media, regardless of the issue.",
      "\u201cThe questions are going to come, but whether we engage or not is part of the consideration,\u201d the official said.",
      "But Trump, who is accustomed to driving the news, is finding out there are limits to his ability to pivot away from an issue that has angered parts of his MAGA base, consumed news media, broken into popular culture and mobilized a Democratic Party that has been dormant and divided since he was re-elected in November.",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge in Florida ruled against the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury testimony in the Epstein case, launching a raft of new headlines. Then, The Wall Street Journal, owned by Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi had told Trump in May that his name appears in the Epstein files \u2014 even though he told reporters in July that Bondi hadn\u2019t informed him that he was named.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that the president kicked [Epstein] out of his club for being a creep,\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement. \u201cThis is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.\u201d",
      "Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d in 2002 but said in 2019 that they had a \u201cfalling-out a long time ago.\u201d He has said he had no knowledge of what Epstein was doing.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump baselessly accused former President Barack Obama of committing \"treason\" because U.S. intelligence agencies found, during the heat of the 2016 campaign, that Russia had tried to interfere in that year's election to assist Trump.",
      "Trump made the highly charged allegation in response to a reporter's question about Epstein, and it prompted a rare rebuke from Obama's office, which called the remarks \"ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"",
      "White House officials hope to limit the blast radius of a self-detonated scandal, which Trump and members of his administration fueled by accusing leading Democrats of hiding information about Epstein when he was seeking the presidency. Bondi raised expectations among Trump supporters in February by promising to release long-sought files, telling Fox News that Epstein's client list was \"sitting on my desk right now.\" But her own Justice Department said this month that it didn\u2019t have any such \"client list,\" and other files remain in his administration's hands.",
      "Trump\u2019s quick pivot to a flurry of other issues that also animate his base have contained much of the unease among top MAGA influencers. Still, political operatives in both parties see the issue as one that is hurting Trump and helping Democrats.",
      "\u201cThings are, obviously, different with this one,\u201d said a Republican operative familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking. \u201cThis has blown a bit of a hole in MAGA, so reflexive defense mode, as we have often seen in the past, won\u2019t always be the go-to. Part of the problem is that this issue has leaked into conservative media. In the past, they [White House] could expect certain interviewers to be friendly and stay on script; that\u2019s not guaranteed with this one.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats see the issue as a perfect vehicle for painting Trump as an elite protecting the powerful at the expense of the masses, undercutting the image he has crafted for himself as a populist champion of the powerless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve got his a-- on something for real, and it\u2019s just a clean, clean hit,\u201d said Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist who is working with several potential 2028 candidates. \u201cHe can\u2019t get off of it.\u201d",
      "Nellis said the Epstein imbroglio could be part of a winning midterm and 2028 presidential message because it threatens MAGA's confidence in the GOP's commitment to exposing corruption. He noted that Vice President JD Vance, widely viewed as a leading candidate for the 2028 Republican nomination, has mostly stopped talking about Epstein after having agreed in an interview with MAGA-friendly podcaster Theo Von last year that the documents should be made public. (Von last week posted a clip of the comment on X and wrote: \u201cYeah, what changed?\u201d)",
      "Vance\u2019s first post amid the recent uproar came last week, after The Wall Street Journal published an article about a letter including a racy drawing that Trump is alleged to have sent Epstein for his birthday in 2003. He called the article \u201ccomplete and utter bulls---.\u201d",
      "But other Democrats expressed reservations over getting too far in front of the Epstein files.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s emblematic of the real lack of opportunities Dems have in this moment,\u201d a national Democratic strategist said. \u201cTrump sort of gifted this, and while it\u2019s great to capitalize on it \u2014 and I\u2019m glad people are \u2014 I\u2019d caution Dems of thinking this is a hot ticket back to anything.\"",

    "story": [
      "The numbers are in: Big toy and auto companies are reporting just how much tariffs are costing them.",
      "Toymaker Hasbro said in its quarterly earnings call Wednesday that it recorded a $1 billion hit for consumer products just in the second quarter as a result of tariff impacts and its long-term outlook. Though the company is projecting growth overall in 2025 with games performing well, it\u2019s expecting consumer products revenue to drop 5%-8% this year because of the import taxes. It anticipates tariffs will make a $60 million dent this year.",
      "To mitigate the tariff impacts, Hasbro is working to reduce the U.S. toys and games it gets from China from around 50% now to less than 40% by 2027. And it\u2019s planning to bring more production to the United States \u2014 something President Donald  Trump has pushed companies to do.",
      "Meanwhile, its competitor Mattel anticipates tariffs could make a dent this year of up to $100 million. The company said it has adjusted pricing \u2014 but didn\u2019t specify what the price increases were, which products were affected or when the changes took effect.",
      "\u201cIt is the price that is necessary to offset some of the headwinds in addition to the array of a multitude of other actions that we\u2019re taking,\u201d Mattel Chief Financial Officer Paul Ruh said.",
      "The company says it\u2019s working to broaden its supply chain faster and improve on its product sourcing to help mitigate tariff impacts. It doesn\u2019t expect any more price hikes this year.",
      "And tariffs aren\u2019t just affecting toy companies \u2014 they\u2019re also hitting some of the biggest automakers in the world.",
      "General Motors said this week tariffs cost it $1.1 billion in the second quarter. And it\u2019s expecting tariffs overall this year could cost it $4 billion to $5 billion. So far, the automaker that produces Chevys, Cadillacs and other brands has eaten that cost, and it\u2019s trying to offset some of the impact through cost cuts and investments in the U.S.",
      "\u201cMany of the manufacturing announcements that we made earlier in the quarter about onshoring production here into the U.S. with $4 billion of capital initiatives are going to have an effect as we get 18 to 24 months down the road,\u201d GM CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC.",
      "Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Chrysler and Dodge, said it expects a $2.7 billion loss in the first half of this year, in part from tariffs.",
      "And Volvo just reported a big decline in its second quarter operating profit. It\u2019s now planning to add its best-selling XC60 SUV to the production line of its South Carolina plant next year.",
      "The auto industry is currently subject to 25% tariffs on imported cars and parts and 50% on steel and aluminum. It\u2019s part of an ever-changing patchwork of tariffs as the Trump administration seeks deals with trading partners around the world ahead of its Aug. 1 tariff deadline. The latest: an agreement with Japan setting tariffs at 15% on Japanese imports, less than the 25% Trump had threatened.",
      "The American Automotive Policy Council, an industry group representing the Detroit Three automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, is worried that the Japan deal could hurt companies making cars across North America. The 15% Japan tariffs are lower than the 25% on Canada and Mexico, where many American car brands manufacture their cars, trucks, vans and SUVs.",
      "\u201cAny deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content than the tariff imposed on North American built vehicles with high U.S. content is a bad deal for U.S. industry and U.S. auto workers,\u201d Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in a statement.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed back against complaints that U.S. automakers could face higher tariffs than companies making cars fully in Japan.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just so silly,\u201d he said in a CNBC interview. \u201cThe American manufacturers are going to do extremely well in America as long as they build it in America.\u201d",
      "Car companies haven\u2019t really upped prices yet as a result of tariffs, but that may change.",
      "\u201cWhat the challenge is going to be for the back half of the year is to figure out, will they continue absorbing a majority of the tariff impact or will we start to see that increase in consumer pricing as they start to try to pass along some of the impact,\u201d said Erin Keating, Cox Automotive executive analyst.",
      "Cox Automotive anticipates car prices may rise 4%-8% by the end of the year. It also found that inventory of both new and used cars dropped in July.",
      "And tariffs might mean fewer toys on the shelves this holiday season. Hasbro reports some retailers are pausing or slowing down imports of holiday inventory.",
      "\u201cA lot of hot products are going to likely be out of stock this holiday because we\u2019re just not going to be able to replenish them because we didn\u2019t have the upfront inventory for them,\u201d Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said. \u201cSo like a Play-Doh Barbie, a Nano-Mals, a Baby Evie. If you\u2019re a mom or a dad, you\u2019re probably going to want to go and buy that early.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The sound of the summer is actually not a song \u2014 it\u2019s an ad.",
      "\u201cNothing beats a Jet2 holiday,\u201d a catchphrase from the British airline\u2019s 2024 ad, mixed with English singer Jess Glynne\u2019s 2015 hit \u201cHold My Hand,\u201d has been used by more than 1.2 million users on TikTok, where it\u2019s become a viral hit in recent months. Searches for Jet2 holiday have also spiked in the last month, according to Google trends.",
      "The original Jet2 ad, which first appeared on the company\u2019s YouTube page last year, shows a family of four as they catch a Jet2 plane to their beachside summer vacation.",
      "Now, audio from the ad is being used more ironically in videos from users who juxtapose the soundbite with footage of chaotic holiday experiences. From catastrophic weather at picture-perfect resorts to passengers misbehaving on flights, the videos often document travel-related setbacks.",
      "No one was more surprised by the popularity of the ad than British actor Zo\u00eb Lister, the voice behind the viral audio. She recorded the ad about 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cSomebody sent me a video yesterday of Joe Jonas using the sound,\u201d she told NBC News in a recent video interview. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s massive!\u2019\u201d",
      "Lister, who introduced herself as the actor behind the audio in a recent TikTok video, said it\u2019s been especially interesting to see the soundbite pick up in the United States, where Americans use the word \u201cvacation\u201d rather than \u201choliday.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t even know what Jet2 holiday is,\u201d she joked. \u201cThey don\u2019t have holidays, they have vacations. Holidays are like Christmas, right? But they have got so on board with the joyful silliness of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoing viral for something just that is really funny and joyful \u2026 that\u2019s quite a wonderful experience,\u201d Lister added.",
      "One of the first videos to use the audio and garner millions of views was from a user who uploaded footage of what appears to be a camel attacking the person, according to meme database KnowYourMeme. Since being posted on TikTok in November 2024, the video has amassed 3.8 million views.",
      "Jet2 picked up on the popularity of the audio in the spring, posting a video on TikTok offering a giveaway for people who uploaded videos partaking in the trend. The travel company is known in the United Kingdom for offering low-cost vacations for British travelers, and providing charter flights to popular holiday destinations around the world, mostly in Europe.",
      "As for Glynne, Lister said the pop star also \u201cdid not ask for any of this\u201d fame. The singer\u2019s \u201cDarling, hold my hand\u201d line from her song is now associated with the Jet2 phrase.",
      "The two met during a Capital FM radio appearance in London on Tuesday, which Lister described as a \u201cwild\u201d moment in her life.",
      "She\u2019s \u201ca super cool mega pop star and I\u2019m this like cheeseball,\u201d Lister said.",
      "Lister, a mother of two, said she\u2019s trying to figure out how to navigate the newfound fame. She was a familiar face to many in the U.K.: From 2006-2017, she played Zoe Carpenter in the popular teen soap opera \u201cHollyoaks,\u201d which aired on Channel 4.",
      "But the virality has boosted her profile more, especially after she posted the TikTok video.",
      "\u201cWhat started happening this last week, which has been really bizarre, is when I\u2019ve been on a train or in a cafe and I can hear people watching [the meme],\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, last Friday I was out with my husband, because we were celebrating our anniversary. And the girls on the next table were literally recording their own \u2018nothing beat the Jet2 holiday\u2019 into their phone.\u201d",
      "Her husband then asked the group recording the video if they would want to meet the \u201cthe woman that does the voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was actually such a brilliant, fun, joyful moment,\u201d Lister said. \u201cAnd everyone was like excited. And we have photos. It was really fun.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s hoping the virality will help her expand her horizons professionally.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been planning a podcast for a while and I\u2019m happy that now I\u2019ve got more of a platform in which to launch something like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots of things that I\u2019d like to do creatively and I hope that this sort of infamy will help launch things.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Chuck Mangione, the jazz musician whose \"Feels So Good\" cracked the top 10 pop chart in the 1970s, died Tuesday, officials said.",
      "He was 84.",
      "Mangione died \"peacefully\" in his sleep at his home in Rochester, New York, according to his obituary. The mayor of Rochester confirmed his death in a statement praising \"the gifted jazz musician and composer.\" Mangione's official cause of death was not announced.",
      "Born in 1940, Mangione grew up in Rochester, graduating from Benjamin Franklin High School before attending and earning a bachelor's from the Eastman School of Music, also in Rochester.",
      "According to the Bartolomeo & Perotto funeral home, Mangione taught at Eastman and later received an honorary doctorate from the school. He also started the school's jazz program.",
      "Mangione kicked off his career as a teenage flugelhorn player when he formed the Jazz Brothers alongside his brother, Gap, according to the obituary. It led to a decadeslong career that yielded 14 Grammy nominations \u2014 and two wins \u2014 an induction into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame and more than 30 albums.",
      "Rochester Mayor Malik D. Evans called Mangione an artist \"who earned international distinction, and Rochester's pride.\"",
      "In 1970, Mangione recorded his \"Friends & Love\" concert with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, which landed him a recording contract and ultimately his first Grammy nomination, according to the funeral home obituary. He released \"Bellavia,\" a record to honor his mother, in the first year he signed with A&M records, which took home the best instrumental composition award at the 19th Grammys.",
      "Mangione's biggest hit, \"Feels So Good,\" soared to No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978 and earned him a nomination for record of the year at the 21st Grammy Awards, bringing the musician to new heights.",
      "In an interview with Celebrity Cafe, Mangione partially credited the Bee Gees for the song's success, Variety reported.",
      "\"I think 'Feels So Good' was such a hit because of the Bee Gees,\" Mangione said in the interview. \"'Saturday Night Fever' had saturated radio; I think the top six out of l0 hits were from that album. Radio programmers couldn't figure out what to put on instead, and when somebody edited 'Feels So Good' from nine minutes down to three, they instantly started playing it as an alternative to what were the current top songs.\"",
      "Mangione also said he wishes he had written \"Feels So Good\" in a different key, \"as the high D is hard to play.\"",
      "\"I am glad that I wrote something that brought joy to millions of people,\" he said.",
      "In 1980, his song \"Give It All You Got\" was chosen as the theme song for the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.",
      "Later in his career, Mangione nabbed a role on the animated hit \"King of the Hill,\" playing himself as a celebrity pitchman for the fictional Mega Lo Mart.",
      "Speaking to Celebrity Cafe, Mangione reflected on playing the animated version of himself, according to Variety.",
      "\"Eight months before 'King of the Hill' was on television, I received the script from them, describing my role as the spokesman for 'Mega Lo Mart.' \u2026 My character would do things like play 'Taps' and switch right into 'Feels So Good,'\" which turned into a long-running bit that had Mangione's character busting out into \"Feels So Good\" no matter the moment.",
      "\"I figured that since they were playing my music and to such a large audience, why not?\" Mangione told Celebrity Cafe of taking the role. \"So I jumped into the studio in New York; they would call from L.A., and then I'd see a thing that looked like me on the television screen. Many people watch that show, so it is great exposure.\"",
      "Mangione and his family were big parts of the Rochester jazz scene, according to Evans, the mayor, who said Mangione and his brother \"honed their art forms in Rochester\u2019s legendary Pythodd Club on Clarissa Street, where their family became close friends with Dizzy Gillespie.\"",
      "According to Variety, Mangione's parents were friendly with many of the jazz greats at the time, allowing Mangione to rub shoulders with the likes of Gillespie, Carmen McRae and Art Blakey. He later joined their group, Jazz Messengers, which propelled him into the mainstream of the genre.",
      "On top of their contributions to jazz culture in Rochester, \"Chuck and his family epitomized the strength, resilience, and compassion that the people of Rochester are so well known for,\" Evans said. The family owned a grocery store in northeast Rochester.",
      "\"As the demographic and economic conditions of the neighborhood evolved, the Mangione family remained committed to their customers and the invaluable service their store provided to the community,\" according to Evans, who pointed out that Mangione's Grocery opened every day during the race riots that engulfed the city in July 1964. It was one of the few shops in the area that did not get looted or burned during the riots, Evans said, \"which is a testament to the mutual admiration and respect shared between the Mangione family and their community.\"",
      "\"The many virtues of this upbringing deeply resonate in the music that Chuck Mangione composed and performed on the world stage,\" Evans said. \"We in Rochester are truly fortunate to hear the underlying beauty of our city in those notes that will forever be Chuck Mangione's legacy.\""

    "story": [
      "Artist Amy Sherald canceled her upcoming show at the Smithsonian after she said the institution wanted to remove a painting of a transgender woman as the Statue of Liberty due to political fears.",
      "Sherald, who rose to fame in 2018 after painting firmer first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s official portrait, said in a statement that she decided to withdraw her exhibition, \u201cAmerican Sublime,\u201d after the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery told her it had concerns about including a portrait of a trans woman titled \u201cTrans Forming Liberty.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese concerns led to discussions about removing the work from the exhibition,\u201d Sherald said in a statement first reported by The New York Times. \u201cWhile no single person is to blame, it\u2019s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role. This painting exists to hold space for someone whose humanity has been politicized and disregarded. I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt a time when transgender people are being legislated against, silenced, and endangered across our nation, silence is not an option. I stand by my work. I stand by my sitters. I stand by the truth that all people deserve to be seen\u2014not only in life, but in art.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Smithsonian Institution, which oversees the gallery, disputed Sherald\u2019s claims and said a top Smithsonian official wanted to better contextualize the painting. More time was needed to address the issue, the spokesperson said, but Sherald withdrew the exhibit before that could be done.",
      "\u201cThe Smithsonian has a long-standing and valued relationship with artist Amy Sherald,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe are and continue to be deeply appreciative of her and the integrity of her work. While we understand Amy\u2019s decision to withdraw her show from the National Portrait Gallery, we are disappointed that Smithsonian audiences will not have an opportunity to experience American Sublime.\u201d",
      "Sherald withdrew her show in a letter to Lonnie G. Bunch III, the secretary of the Smithsonian, The New York Times reported. In the letter, which has not been reviewed by NBC News, Sherald said she understood that a video would have replaced the painting, but she still decided to cancel.",
      "\u201cThe video would have opened up for debate the value of trans visibility and I was opposed to that being a part of the \u2018American Sublime\u2019 narrative,\u201d she wrote in the letter, the Times reported.",
      "\u201cAmerican Sublime\u201d was organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and included paintings of Sherald\u2019s from 2007 to the present.",
      "According to the gallery, Sherald would have been the first contemporary Black artist to have a solo exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery."

      "Trump administration regulators have approved Skydance Media\u2019s $8 billion bid to acquire CBS News parent company Paramount, paving the way for a tectonic shift in ownership of one of America\u2019s three major networks.",
      "The Federal Communications Commission said Thursday that it had approved the acquisition, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr adding in a news release that the move would bring change to the company's news coverage. Paramount owns CBS, which includes CBS News.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,\" Carr said. \"That is why I welcome Skydance\u2019s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.  In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company\u2019s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.\"",
      "\"Today\u2019s decision also marks another step forward in the FCC\u2019s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination,\" Carr added.",
      "In recent days, Paramount's new owner made a number of concessions to the FCC, including agreeing to not implement any diversity, equity or inclusion programs. Skydance also said it would \"undertake a comprehensive review\" of CBS and \"will commit, for a period of at least two years, to have in place an ombudsman.\" That role would report to the president of the new company.",
      "A number of companies that have billion-dollar transactions pending before Carr's FCC have also backed off of DEI programs, including Verizon and T-Mobile.",
      "The concessions also came after Paramount Global settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million. Trump brought that suit, saying the way CBS edited a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris was \"election and voter interference.\"",
      "The lone Democrat in FCC leadership, Commissioner Anna Gomez, did not mince words about the push to secure promises from the companies.",
      "\u201cAfter months of cowardly capitulation to this Administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,\" she said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,\" she added. \"Once again, this agency is undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity by overstepping its authority and intervening in employment matters reserved for other government entities with proper jurisdiction on these issues.\"",
      "\"Even more alarming, it is now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.\"",
      "Skydance is run by David Ellison, son of Oracle founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. While the younger Ellison made a donation to President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election fund in February 2024 shortly before the former president bowed out of the race, Trump recently signaled his comfort with his takeover of Paramount and its assets, which in addition to CBS News  include Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, The CW, MTV, BET and film franchises like \u201cSmurfs\u201d and \u201cSonic the Hedgehog.\u201d",
      "\u201cEllison is great. He\u2019ll do a great job with it,\u201d Trump said in June.",
      "There is likely to be a sea change in the editorial direction of CBS News under its new ownership. In a recent filing, Ellison and Skydance said they\u2019d told Carr that they were committed to pursuing a focus on \u201cAmerican storytelling\u201d while touting a new, \u201cunbiased\u201d editorial direction for CBS News. Their meeting came shortly after Paramount agreed to settle Trump\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "It also came just days after CBS announced it was canceling \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d currently hosted by Stephen Colbert \u2014 an announcement Trump praised on social media. Colbert had recently criticized the parent company\u2019s multimillion-dollar settlement with Trump, while CBS said the cancellation was \u201cpurely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\u201d",
      "There had been signs of an editorial shift ahead of the merger. Most notably, longtime \u201c60 Minutes\u201d editor Bill Owens announced he was stepping down this spring, citing CBS News\u2019 fading editorial independence. Shortly after, CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon was pushed out. Last week, The New York Times reported Skydance was in early talks to acquire the conservative-leaning The Free Press media outlet. Meanwhile, \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Jon Stewart has said he did not know whether his program would survive the merger.",
      "Skydance has spent years pursuing Paramount and eventually realized it could successfully execute the transaction by purchasing Paramount\u2019s parent, National Amusements, the company once helmed by Sumner Redstone, the father of the company\u2019s current chairwoman, president and CEO, Shari Redstone. Yet the proposed deal continued to face hurdles, first under the Biden administration then at the outset of Trump\u2019s term. Its approval came in what was its third deadline extension period."

      "The numbers are in: Big toy and auto companies are reporting just how much tariffs are costing them.",
      "Toymaker Hasbro said in its quarterly earnings call Wednesday that it recorded a $1 billion hit for consumer products just in the second quarter as a result of tariff impacts and its long-term outlook. Though the company is projecting growth overall in 2025 with games performing well, it\u2019s expecting consumer products revenue to drop 5%-8% this year because of the import taxes. It anticipates tariffs will make a $60 million dent this year.",
      "To mitigate the tariff impacts, Hasbro is working to reduce the U.S. toys and games it gets from China from around 50% now to less than 40% by 2027. And it\u2019s planning to bring more production to the United States \u2014 something President Donald  Trump has pushed companies to do.",
      "Meanwhile, its competitor Mattel anticipates tariffs could make a dent this year of up to $100 million. The company said it has adjusted pricing \u2014 but didn\u2019t specify what the price increases were, which products were affected or when the changes took effect.",
      "\u201cIt is the price that is necessary to offset some of the headwinds in addition to the array of a multitude of other actions that we\u2019re taking,\u201d Mattel Chief Financial Officer Paul Ruh said.",
      "The company says it\u2019s working to broaden its supply chain faster and improve on its product sourcing to help mitigate tariff impacts. It doesn\u2019t expect any more price hikes this year.",
      "And tariffs aren\u2019t just affecting toy companies \u2014 they\u2019re also hitting some of the biggest automakers in the world.",
      "General Motors said this week tariffs cost it $1.1 billion in the second quarter. And it\u2019s expecting tariffs overall this year could cost it $4 billion to $5 billion. So far, the automaker that produces Chevys, Cadillacs and other brands has eaten that cost, and it\u2019s trying to offset some of the impact through cost cuts and investments in the U.S.",
      "\u201cMany of the manufacturing announcements that we made earlier in the quarter about onshoring production here into the U.S. with $4 billion of capital initiatives are going to have an effect as we get 18 to 24 months down the road,\u201d GM CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC.",
      "Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Chrysler and Dodge, said it expects a $2.7 billion loss in the first half of this year, in part from tariffs.",
      "And Volvo just reported a big decline in its second quarter operating profit. It\u2019s now planning to add its best-selling XC60 SUV to the production line of its South Carolina plant next year.",
      "The auto industry is currently subject to 25% tariffs on imported cars and parts and 50% on steel and aluminum. It\u2019s part of an ever-changing patchwork of tariffs as the Trump administration seeks deals with trading partners around the world ahead of its Aug. 1 tariff deadline. The latest: an agreement with Japan setting tariffs at 15% on Japanese imports, less than the 25% Trump had threatened.",
      "The American Automotive Policy Council, an industry group representing the Detroit Three automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, is worried that the Japan deal could hurt companies making cars across North America. The 15% Japan tariffs are lower than the 25% on Canada and Mexico, where many American car brands manufacture their cars, trucks, vans and SUVs.",
      "\u201cAny deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content than the tariff imposed on North American built vehicles with high U.S. content is a bad deal for U.S. industry and U.S. auto workers,\u201d Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in a statement.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed back against complaints that U.S. automakers could face higher tariffs than companies making cars fully in Japan.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just so silly,\u201d he said in a CNBC interview. \u201cThe American manufacturers are going to do extremely well in America as long as they build it in America.\u201d",
      "Car companies haven\u2019t really upped prices yet as a result of tariffs, but that may change.",
      "\u201cWhat the challenge is going to be for the back half of the year is to figure out, will they continue absorbing a majority of the tariff impact or will we start to see that increase in consumer pricing as they start to try to pass along some of the impact,\u201d said Erin Keating, Cox Automotive executive analyst.",
      "Cox Automotive anticipates car prices may rise 4%-8% by the end of the year. It also found that inventory of both new and used cars dropped in July.",
      "And tariffs might mean fewer toys on the shelves this holiday season. Hasbro reports some retailers are pausing or slowing down imports of holiday inventory.",
      "\u201cA lot of hot products are going to likely be out of stock this holiday because we\u2019re just not going to be able to replenish them because we didn\u2019t have the upfront inventory for them,\u201d Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said. \u201cSo like a Play-Doh Barbie, a Nano-Mals, a Baby Evie. If you\u2019re a mom or a dad, you\u2019re probably going to want to go and buy that early.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, we dive into how Democrats are continuing to put Republicans on Capitol Hill in a tough spot on the Epstein files. Plus, Jonathan Allen explores the potential power shift the saga has revealed in the GOP-led House.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "As lawmakers leave town, Democrats declare an 'Epstein recess'",
      "As the House prepared to leave Washington for its summer recess, Democrats were united around one goal: forcing Republicans over and over again to confront the Epstein issue.",
      "Kyle Stewart and Syedah Asghar report that across several committees Wednesday, Democrats brought up amendments on whether the government\u2019s files on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein should be released.",
      "It\u2019s part of a broader effort by Democrats to capitalize on a pain point for Republicans, a rare moment when President Donald Trump appears to be out of step with his base. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ultimately canceled the House\u2019s final day of votes before recess after Democrats ground a key organizing committee to a halt with Epstein amendments. (More on that below.)",
      "Members now head home to their districts for what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called \u201cthe Epstein recess.\u201d",
      "The flurry of Democratic amendment offerings in the House succeeded in one case Wednesday. A motion by Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., to compel the Justice Department to release files tied to Epstein was approved in a House Oversight subcommittee hearing. A committee spokesperson later said the subpoena will be issued but did not provide timing.",
      "Lee\u2019s motion attracted the votes of three Republicans, who joined with five Democrats to pass it.",
      "In the Senate: Sens. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., sparred over competing Epstein-related resolutions on the Senate floor this afternoon, Brennan Leach reports.",
      "Gallego accused House Republicans of \u201cfleeing\u201d D.C. to punt on accountability on Epstein.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re simply wanting to do here is give [Trump] cover,\u201d Mullin said, accusing Democrats of using the Epstein files to \u201cgo after\u201d the president.",
      "And in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Cory Booker, D-N.J., argued over a resolution to force the release of the Epstein files, which Booker ultimately withdrew, Frank Thorp V notes.",
      "At the White House: Meanwhile, Trump and his aides have settled on silence as a strategy to stamp out criticism of his refusal to release files detailing the federal government\u2019s investigation of Epstein, according to a senior administration official and Republicans familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking.",
      "Jonathan Allen, Matt Dixon, Henry J. Gomez, Allan Smith and Natasha Korecki report that in a break from Trump\u2019s usual crisis communications template \u2014 which emphasizes an all-hands-on-deck approach to defending him on television and on social media \u2014 the Epstein case has been met with more restraint from the White House.",
      "Trump himself has signaled that he doesn\u2019t want members of his administration talking about the matter nonstop, a person close to the White House told NBC News. And White House aides have made it clear that no one in the administration is allowed to talk about Epstein without high-level vetting, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The latest: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Ghislaine Maxwell and Maxwell\u2019s attorneys met in a conference room inside the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Michael Kosnar reports.",
      "Read more: Trump foe Thomas Massie wins over MAGA allies with his push for Epstein files, by Scott Wong and Sahil Kapur",
      "The Epstein saga reveals a potential power shift in the House",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is getting battered by his own right arm \u2014 the Rules Committee.",
      "The panel, which controls which measures receive votes on the House floor, rebelled against the Louisiana Republican this week as GOP leaders tried to stop lawmakers from demanding the release of the Justice Department\u2019s Jeffrey Epstein files.",
      "At an impasse, and unable to move forward with any legislation, Johnson sent the House home early for its August recess. It seems like the Epstein matter has been delayed rather than killed.",
      "But on a broader level, the Rules Committee revolt represents a significant potential power shift in the chamber. For more than 60 years, the panel has been considered an arm of the speakership \u2014 with the majority-party\u2019s leader handpicking its chair and members.",
      "In 1961, the committee, then dominated by the chamber\u2019s bipartisan conservative bloc, was its own rogue source of power. The chairman, Rep. Howard Smith, D-Va., opposed newly elected President John F. Kennedy\u2019s New Frontier agenda \u2014 especially its civil rights plank.",
      "Then-Speaker Sam Rayburn, a Texan, wanted to help Kennedy and forced a crucial vote on the House floor to pack the committee with three additional members \u2014 two Democrats and Illinois Republican Elmer Hoffman \u2014 who were amenable to civil rights.",
      "In a nail-biter that consumed the Capitol and national news pages at the time, Rayburn beat Smith on the floor, 217-212, and broke the committee\u2019s stranglehold. Over decades, the committee not only lost its independence, it became the speaker\u2019s tool.",
      "But conservative Republicans in recent years have forced GOP leaders to appoint more of their own to the ranks of the committee\u2019s roster, and the seeds of that play for power are now blooming.",
      "History suggests that the less power the speaker has, the more likely the House is to pass bills \u2014 or kill them \u2014 based on the sentiments of the majority of House members, rather than the diktats of the majority party\u2019s leadership.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say that the pendulum is swinging back toward independence for the committee, but this week\u2019s activity shows that it is stirring.",

      "On Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s longtime accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell for several hours in a Florida U.S. attorney\u2019s office. On Aug. 11, Maxwell is scheduled for a jailhouse deposition sought by the House Oversight Committee.",
      "As the uproar over the Epstein files continues, a central question is whether Maxwell can be trusted to tell the truth.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s attorney, David Oscar Markus, told reporters after the meeting with Blanche that \u201cshe answered all of the questions truthfully, honestly and to the best of her ability.\u201d",
      "But prosecutors and the judge who oversaw her 2021 trial have said Maxwell had made multiple false statements under oath and failed to take responsibility for her actions. She was convicted of sex trafficking minors and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct, including some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has been and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a pretrial motion.",
      "Prosecutors said that Maxwell also lied when she was given a chance to acknowledge her actions in a 2016 civil suit. \u201cWhen the defendant was given the opportunity to address her conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s attorneys said at the time that \u201cthe questions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and improperly formed.\u201d They added, \u201cThere were no \u2018crimes\u2019 concealed by Ms. Maxwell\u2019s answers.\u201d",
      "After Maxwell was found guilty of recruiting, grooming and trafficking multiple teenage girls for Epstein, Judge Alison Nathan said that Maxwell had not accepted responsibility for her crimes.",
      "\u201cMs. Maxwell today acknowledged the courage of the victims, talked about the pain and anguish they expressed, to some extent acknowledged the pain and suffering,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cWhat wasn\u2019t expressed was acceptance of responsibility.\u201d",
      "Jack Scarola, a lawyer who represents roughly 20 Epstein victims, said that Maxwell\u2019s history of mendacity shows that any investigator who questions her must be thoroughly prepared. \u201cIt is apparent to us that approaching an interview casually will be a complete waste of time,\u201d he said.",
      "New Hampshire house",
      "Maxwell attempted to hide her whereabouts from FBI agents before she was arrested in 2021, according to prosecutors. Maxwell, a daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was living in a 4,300-square-foot timber-frame house on a 156-acre property in rural New Hampshire. Records showed that it was purchased for a little more than $1 million by an anonymous limited liability corporation the previous year.",
      "After the agents moved past a security guard hired by Maxwell, they saw her peering out a window from inside the house. After Maxwell did not respond to knocks on the door, agents broke down the door and entered, according to court documents.",
      "During an FBI search of the residence, they found one of Maxwell\u2019s phones wrapped in tinfoil. Prosecutors called that a haphazard and ineffective way to try to thwart law enforcement cellphone surveillance.",
      "After her arrest, Maxwell did not state the liquid assets at her disposal, as required by her bail application, according to prosecutors. Maxwell listed accounts at an English bank with \u201cmaximum values totaling well over $2 million.\u201d But she did not disclose a Swiss bank account with an approximate balance of $4 million.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that \u201cto the extent the defendant now refuses to account for her ownership of or access to vast wealth, it is not because it does not exist, it is because she is attempting to hide it.\u201d",
      "Civil case deposition",
      "After her arrest, Maxwell was also charged with two counts of perjury alleging she made false statements in a deposition under oath in the 2016 civil case. Prosecutors alleged that Maxwell lied when she said she was not aware of Epstein\u2019s efforts to recruit underage girls for sex.",
      "Maxwell also lied when she claimed she was unaware of anyone 18 years or younger being on Epstein\u2019s properties, they said, and when she denied that she had sexual contact with other women while with Epstein, and that Epstein had sex toys.",
      "After prosecutors secured a conviction against Maxwell, they declined to move forward with a court-ordered trial on the perjury charges.",
      "Legal experts say that cooperating witnesses who have previously lied can still be effective witnesses if there is evidence that corroborates their claims. Their credibility can also be boosted if they give a compelling reason for why they lied."

    "story": [
      "Chuck Mangione, the jazz musician whose \"Feels So Good\" cracked the top 10 pop chart in the 1970s, died Tuesday, officials said.",
      "He was 84.",
      "Mangione died \"peacefully\" in his sleep at his home in Rochester, New York, according to his obituary. The mayor of Rochester confirmed his death in a statement praising \"the gifted jazz musician and composer.\" Mangione's official cause of death was not announced.",
      "Born in 1940, Mangione grew up in Rochester, graduating from Benjamin Franklin High School before attending and earning a bachelor's from the Eastman School of Music, also in Rochester.",
      "According to the Bartolomeo & Perotto funeral home, Mangione taught at Eastman and later received an honorary doctorate from the school. He also started the school's jazz program.",
      "Mangione kicked off his career as a teenage flugelhorn player when he formed the Jazz Brothers alongside his brother, Gap, according to the obituary. It led to a decadeslong career that yielded 14 Grammy nominations \u2014 and two wins \u2014 an induction into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame and more than 30 albums.",
      "Rochester Mayor Malik D. Evans called Mangione an artist \"who earned international distinction, and Rochester's pride.\"",
      "In 1970, Mangione recorded his \"Friends & Love\" concert with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, which landed him a recording contract and ultimately his first Grammy nomination, according to the funeral home obituary. He released \"Bellavia,\" a record to honor his mother, in the first year he signed with A&M records, which took home the best instrumental composition award at the 19th Grammys.",
      "Mangione's biggest hit, \"Feels So Good,\" soared to No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978 and earned him a nomination for record of the year at the 21st Grammy Awards, bringing the musician to new heights.",
      "In an interview with Celebrity Cafe, Mangione partially credited the Bee Gees for the song's success, Variety reported.",
      "\"I think 'Feels So Good' was such a hit because of the Bee Gees,\" Mangione said in the interview. \"'Saturday Night Fever' had saturated radio; I think the top six out of l0 hits were from that album. Radio programmers couldn't figure out what to put on instead, and when somebody edited 'Feels So Good' from nine minutes down to three, they instantly started playing it as an alternative to what were the current top songs.\"",
      "Mangione also said he wishes he had written \"Feels So Good\" in a different key, \"as the high D is hard to play.\"",
      "\"I am glad that I wrote something that brought joy to millions of people,\" he said.",
      "In 1980, his song \"Give It All You Got\" was chosen as the theme song for the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.",
      "Later in his career, Mangione nabbed a role on the animated hit \"King of the Hill,\" playing himself as a celebrity pitchman for the fictional Mega Lo Mart.",
      "Speaking to Celebrity Cafe, Mangione reflected on playing the animated version of himself, according to Variety.",
      "\"Eight months before 'King of the Hill' was on television, I received the script from them, describing my role as the spokesman for 'Mega Lo Mart.' \u2026 My character would do things like play 'Taps' and switch right into 'Feels So Good,'\" which turned into a long-running bit that had Mangione's character busting out into \"Feels So Good\" no matter the moment.",
      "\"I figured that since they were playing my music and to such a large audience, why not?\" Mangione told Celebrity Cafe of taking the role. \"So I jumped into the studio in New York; they would call from L.A., and then I'd see a thing that looked like me on the television screen. Many people watch that show, so it is great exposure.\"",
      "Mangione and his family were big parts of the Rochester jazz scene, according to Evans, the mayor, who said Mangione and his brother \"honed their art forms in Rochester\u2019s legendary Pythodd Club on Clarissa Street, where their family became close friends with Dizzy Gillespie.\"",
      "According to Variety, Mangione's parents were friendly with many of the jazz greats at the time, allowing Mangione to rub shoulders with the likes of Gillespie, Carmen McRae and Art Blakey. He later joined their group, Jazz Messengers, which propelled him into the mainstream of the genre.",
      "On top of their contributions to jazz culture in Rochester, \"Chuck and his family epitomized the strength, resilience, and compassion that the people of Rochester are so well known for,\" Evans said. The family owned a grocery store in northeast Rochester.",
      "\"As the demographic and economic conditions of the neighborhood evolved, the Mangione family remained committed to their customers and the invaluable service their store provided to the community,\" according to Evans, who pointed out that Mangione's Grocery opened every day during the race riots that engulfed the city in July 1964. It was one of the few shops in the area that did not get looted or burned during the riots, Evans said, \"which is a testament to the mutual admiration and respect shared between the Mangione family and their community.\"",
      "\"The many virtues of this upbringing deeply resonate in the music that Chuck Mangione composed and performed on the world stage,\" Evans said. \"We in Rochester are truly fortunate to hear the underlying beauty of our city in those notes that will forever be Chuck Mangione's legacy.\""

      "The final days of a Seattle cat were spent in \"terror\" due to flyovers by Blue Angels fighter pilots, before squadron leaders blocked the feline's human mother on social media in an act of \"cowardly censorship,\" she said in a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Layla was 14 when she died on Aug. 11 last year following a battle with heart disease, which was allegedly exacerbated by the Blue Angels flying overhead days \u2014 and one year \u2014 earlier, plaintiff Lauren Ann Lombardi said in her federal civil complaint.",
      "The Blue Angels are the U.S. Navy\u2019s flight demonstration squadron and have been performing aerobatic maneuvers across the U.S. since 1946.",
      "Lombardi had voiced her concerns about the impact of the Blue Angels flying over Seattle in 2023, telling off the squadron in an expletive-laden tirade.",
      "\"Stop with your F------g bull---- you are terrorizing my cat and all the other animals and wildlife,\" Lombardi wrote to the squadron via Instagram on Aug. 3 last year. \"Nobody gives a f--- about your stupid little planes.\"",
      "Lombardi, a paralegal in Seattle, was then allegedly blocked a short time later.",
      "She tried to direct-message the Blue Angels with a one-word response, \"cowards,\" on Aug. 5 last year, \"which appeared to send but was never delivered due to the blocking,\" according to the lawsuit penned by attorney Nacim Bouchtia, who is married to Lombardi and was listed as Layla's human father in the feline's obituary.",
      "When the Blue Angels returned a year later, Layla had just come home from the animal hospital and was in the throes of her final battle with heart disease, Lombardi said.",
      "Even though Layla was heavily sedated, her \"primitive limbic system overruled her medication and she fled in primal panic beneath furniture, her labored breathing escalating to clinically dangerous levels,\" Bouchtia wrote.",
      "Lombardi put thick blankets in the windows and physically put her hands over Layla's ears \"to no avail\" as the cat's \"walnut-sized brain\" was stricken by \"pure debilitating terror,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "While her human didn't pin Layla's death on the Navy, the plaintiff lamented that the late feline \"died knowing only fear when she should have known only love,\" Bouchtia wrote.",
      "The crux of Layla's parents' lawsuit stems from the Blue Angels' block of Lombardi on Instagram, which was still in place on Thursday, according to the attorney.",
      "Whether public officials or agencies can block individuals on social media is still a rather unsettled legal question.",
      "Lombardi's lawsuit named Cmdr. Adam Bryan, commanding officer of the Blue Angels, and Lt. Ben Bushong, the squadron's social media administrator, as defendants.",
      "A representative of the Blue Angels could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday.",
      "Lombardi is seeking to have the block lifted, an order that the Blue Angels not bar \"anyone else\" on \"the basis of viewpoint,\" and attorneys' fees.",
      "Even without Lombardi and Bouchtia's dealings with the Blue Angels regarding Layla, they did not appear to be fans of the aviators.",
      "They called their performances \"auditory carpet bombing\" with the \"subtlety of a military occupation.\"",
      "They described squad commanders as \"emotionally fragile snowflakes\" who blocked the plaintiff on social media, transforming \"personal tragedy into Constitutional treason.\"",
      "\"Layla was the greatest cat that ever lived and her final days on this Earth were pockmarked by debilitating terror brought on my the actions of the United State Government,\" the plaintiff said.",
      "The Blue Angels are next set to perform Aug. 2-3 at the Boeing Seafair Air Show in Seattle."

      "So far, Season 2 has stayed true to form in chronicling the dramatics of the core group, made up of Nan (Kristine Froseth), Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse), Conchita (Alisha Boe), Mabel (Josie Totah) and Lizzy (Aubri Ibrag).",
      "Mabel has been living with Conchita and her husband, Lord Richard Marable (Josh Dylan). Nan has been struggling to enjoy her marriage with Theo, the Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), due to her lingering feelings for Guy Thwarte (Matthew Broome). And Lizzy has been conducting a secret affair with Theo amid her own engagement to Hector Robinson (Jacob Ifan).",
      "Meanwhile, Jinny, after escaping from her abusive husband, Lord James Seadown (Barney Fishwick), at the end of Season 1, has been hiding in Italy with her newborn son under Guy's protection.",
      "\"I think she feels really lonely and isolated,\" Waterhouse tells TODAY.com about her character's storyline this season. \"And even though she's with Guy, who's amazing, they kind of don't really know each other. They're, like, thrown into the situation, and suddenly there's a baby, and they're living in quite intense circumstances.\"",
      "Things only get more intense in Episode 6 after James tracks down his estranged wife and newborn son, Freddy, in Italy. He kidnaps the baby, forcing Jinny to go back to London where she's wanted for kidnapping Freddy after leaving James while pregnant. As the group plots to get Freddy back, James orchestrates a public confrontation with Jinny at an opera, where she appears violent and hysterical to onlookers, resulting in her being committed to an asylum.",
      "After a significant stay, she agrees to go back to James' estate in order to be reunited with Freddy, but she never gives up in her fight against James.",
      "\"I think she kind of allowed a lot of James' behavior when it was just her, because she was fighting for their marriage and all these other expectations that she had on her,\" Waterhouse says. \"But now she has a baby. I think that pushes her to realize that it's bigger than just her now, and she's got to protect her baby from him as well.\"",
      "In the end, James' siblings, Richard and Honoria (Mia Threapleton) come to Jinny's aid. They hatch a plan to distract their brother and smuggle Jinny and Freddy out of the home.",
      "While James and Richard talk downstairs, Honoria finds Freddy and escapes in a carriage with the infant. But once James realizes Freddy is gone, a fight ensues. Richard briefly knocks out James and runs upstairs to free Jinny from a locked room. But as they try to escape, they encounter James holding a gun.",
      "Richard, again, distracts James so Jinny can run away. After she flees, James points the gun at his head while Richard tries to talk him down, telling his younger brother they can fix things together.",
      "The scene then cuts to Jinny hiding behind a tree on the property as a gunshot goes off. As she rushes back to the home, she finds James catatonic over Richard's lifeless body.",
      "Why Does Lord Seadown Kill His Brother, Richard?",
      "In the lead up to Richard's shocking death, his family's dynamic is explored more in depth after his mother, Lady Brightlingsea (Fenella Woolgar), helps James pull off framing Jinny at the opera. But once Jinny is removed from the asylum and back at his estate, Lady Brightlingsea admits that her middle child may have taken the situation with Jinny too far. Speaking to Richard, the matriarch recalls how James was always a \"funny fish,\" struggling to socialize with other children but desperate to please his older brother. She suggests that James wanted to marry an American woman, Jinny, because Richard did.",
      "Richard uses this knowledge to distract James in his rescue of Jinny and Freddy.",
      "Fishwick says in an interview with TODAY.com that the murder was a \"vindictive\" act on James' part and compares his character's dynamic with Richard to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.",
      "\"You don't necessarily see a lot of it in Season 1 or 2, but it's kind of interesting looking back and thinking that there's probably some kind of status dynamic going on between Richard, who's the charming, easygoing, firstborn son, and James, who doesn't inherit a title. I think he finds people a lot more difficult. There's this kind of brotherly tension,\" Fishwick explains.",
      "Dylan tells TODAY.com that while the death may come as a surprise to audiences, he understands it. \"I think it makes a lot of sense,\" he says.",
      "He says his character's death made his scenes with Boe's Conchita, whom he married at the very start of the show\u00a0\u2014 Season 1, Episode 1\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all the more special.",
      "\"We just tried to be really present with each other and have a lot of fun,\" Dylan says. \"Our relationship is in a really lovely place when that happens.\"",
      "Boe chimes in and adds, \"It makes it more heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.\"",
      "While Conchita was introduced in the series premiere as a free spirit, wild child American who clashes with her new husband's strict family, Boe says her character's grief will put her in survival mode.",
      "\"Now she\u2019s a single mother, and on top of that, she has to worry about taking care of her household because they are in financial distress,\" Boe says. \"I think the grief of losing her Dickie, it made her have to realign her priorities and ... she just had to really hunker down and be like, 'You know what? This is what I have to do to survive.'\""

    "story": [
      "25 YEARS AGO, my family created a lifelong connection with the Backstreet Boys. It might sound...unique for not just two fangirls, but also their parents, to be devoted to a boyband. But for our foursome, BSB has been the soundtrack to a shared life of love...and unexpected loss.",
      "The connection reached a full-circle moment this year when the group announced on TODAY their \u201cInto the Millennium\u201d Sphere residency in Las Vegas. It was a celebration of the 25-year anniversary of their hit album \u2014 but for my family, it was a reminder of a time that changed everything for us.",
      "It all began when I was about eight years old and my sister Leslie and I walked into Lucky\u2019s grocery store. She ran straight to the magazine section; four years older than me, she had recently discovered the Backstreet Boys and wanted to show me her favorite member, Nick Carter.",
      "Grabbing one of the bright teen magazines, my eyes went instead to dark-haired, green-eyed Kevin Richardson. From there, while my mom grocery shopped, our ritual became standing in that aisle, flipping the pages to every Backstreet Boys photo we could find.",
      "Our infatuation only grew as the years went by. We consumed every bit of information about all five \u201cboys,\u201d belted their songs on the radio and religiously watched \u201cTotal Request Live\u201d with Carson Daly on MTV. (My cheeks turned hot as I watched the rain scene in \u201cQuit Playing Games With My Heart.\u201d)",
      "Knowing how much we loved them, my mom often gave in to purchasing the BSB merch we saw at the mall and stores. When we begged to call \u201cTRL\u201d countless times, she always indulged us. And when we were in the car yelling every single lyric to every single song? She was right there singing along with us.",
      "By 1999, BSB was embarking on their \u201cInto the Millennium Tour,\u201d to accompany their sophomore album, \u201cMillennium.\u201d Desperate to see them in concert, Leslie and I begged our parents to let us go. By this time, our bedroom was covered in floor-to-ceiling posters; while my dad huffed about our decor choices, my mom never seemed to mind, often buying us more magazines to help us add to our collection.",
      "Finally, my dad gave in after endless pestering: \u201cIf you can save up the money to buy your own ticket, you can go.\u201d",
      "For months, my sister and I put aside the money we got from our birthdays and report cards, and we did chores around the house. I pocketed any spare change we found, including the coins by my dad's wallet. (To me, it was fair game!) When it was time to purchase tickets, we proudly stood in front of my dad with our savings: A grand total of around $100.",
      "Back in those days, we had to go to a JCPenney Ticketmaster concierge to purchase tickets. So we headed to the mall, plopped down our money and asked for two tickets to the Backstreet Boys show in Anaheim, California, the closest venue to our San Diego county town of Ramona.",
      "But then our dad chimed in saying he wanted four tickets. Perplexed, my sister and I looked at each other and told him we didn\u2019t have enough for two more.",
      "He looked at us. \u201cYou proved that you can save money for something you really want, and you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a treat, I will pay for your tickets, and your mom and I will also go.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 15, 1999, I attended my first Backstreet Boys concert (and first-ever concert) at the then-Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now the Honda Center). Our seats were high up, but I remember my dad borrowing a friend's camcorder to record the entire show. Sitting next to us, he zoomed in on the stage as my sister and I fangirled. The moment the band opened the show and flew in on futuristic surfboards, we couldn't contain our screams.",
      "My mom, dad, sister and I belted out the songs we all knew from repeatedly playing their albums. And when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d \u2014 the group's ode to a mother's love \u2014 came on, we dedicated it to my mom.",
      "I saved my ticket from that show, which I still have to this day. My sister and I would rewatch the recording of the concert with my mom on the VCR until it stopped working. As a Mexican household, we also loved the group's songs in Spanish, like \u201cNunca Te Hare Llorar,\u201d as well as \u201cAnywhere For You,\u201d or \u201cDonde Quieras Yo Ir\u00e9.\u201d And it was known that my dad\u2019s favorite song was \u201cI\u2019ll Never Break Your Heart.\u201d But every single birthday and Mother's Day, for my mom, we'd always play \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "And then, on May 14, 2015, she died unexpectedly in a car crash.",
      "The last day my sister and I saw our mom was on Mother\u2019s Day. We had played \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d for her that morning. Yet somehow, inexplicably, four days later we were grieving her.",
      "The Backstreet Boys' song \u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,\u201d suddenly took on a new significance for me and my sister. The song is about losing someone close to you; at the time it was released, Kevin Richardson was mourning the death of his father, while Howie Dorough had a sister who had also passed. Additionally, the music video was dedicated to their late producer, Denniz Pop.",
      "Still, I never imagined I'd one day listen to the song while mourning myself.",
      "Fast forward to this summer, which marked 25 years since that first \u201cMillennium\u201d concert \u2014 and 10 years after my mom died. My sister, Dad and I decided we had to attend the anniversary show in Las Vegas; it would be a way to relive an important memory while also commemorating my mom. Plus, one thing my sister and I have learned is that time is sacred \u2014 and we won't always have our dad around to make memories with.",
      "A day before the July 11 opening night concert in Las Vegas, an ache settled in my chest as I thought about my mom not being able to experience this moment with us. I know she would have been so excited to dress up, and to sing every song while spending time with us. I can even picture her once again wearing the Backstreet Boys scarf we bought at the first concert around her ponytail like she once did, much to my delight.",
      "Ahead of their anniversary shows this summer, the Backstreet Boys asked their attendees to wear white. I didn't know if my dad would abide by the suggested dress code \u2014 but to my surprise, when we met up for the show, there he was in a white button-up and steel blue pants.",
      "The group opened the show with their hit \u201cLarger Than Life,\u201d a song my dad instantly knew. We laughed as he jammed out while recording the entire thing on his phone.",
      "As the show continued, we were all hyped up and tuned in to the graphics and visuals. But when photos appeared on the screen of the Backstreet Boys with their mothers, wives and kids, we knew what song was coming: \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "As the piano played, Kevin took the mic for the first verse. But then, eyes closed, he lifted the mic to his mouth \u2014 then shook his head, unable to sing. We assumed he was overcome with grief and sadness as he remembered his own late mother Ann, who died in 2022.",
      "Tears rolled down my face. I looked over at my sister, and she was also crying. My dad's face was somber; even though my parents weren't in the best place when my mom died, I knew he must have been hurting, too. I even swore I could see him mouthing some of the lyrics.",

And just like Kevin now found himself able to sing the intro of the song without tearing up, I also managed to keep it together. I thought about how happy my mom would be that we still think of her \u2014 and the memories we shared at our first concert \u2014 whenever that song plays.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 18:40:21 GMT",
    "summary": "The Trisha Paytas Baby Curse theory is the idea that celebrities who die are reincarnated as the YouTuber's babies. Ozzy Osbourne is the latest in the theory.",
    "story": [
      "The death of rock icon Ozzy Osbourne and the birth of YouTuber Trisha Paytas\u2019s baby is combining to ressucitate an old and deeply weird conspiracy theory: the Trisha Paytas Baby Curse.",
      "According to legend, a celebrity death accompanies the birth of each of Paytas\u2019s three babies. Even though it doesn\u2019t add up \u2014 in a lot of ways \u2014 the theory persists, and memes abound suggesting that the recently departed musician will be reincarnated as the child of the podcaster who gained fame through viral YouTube videos.",
      "(For the record, TODAY.com does not endorse this theory, which is clearly meant to be tongue-in-cheek.)",
      "What? How? Why?",
      "The theory is part of an internet meme known as the \u201cTrisha Paytas Baby Curse,\u201d which links her pregnancies to the deaths, or illness, of public figures. While entirely speculative, the joke popped up when Pope Francis died while she was pregnant with her third child, who she named Aquaman.",
      "(You read that right, Aquaman. Her two older children are Malibu Barbie and Elvis.)",
      "During the April 22 episode of her podcast, \u201cJust Trish,\u201c Paytas addressed the speculation.",
      "\u201cIs it just like any influential person that dies gets to come reincarnate as my baby?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why my womb is carrying all these souls.\u201d",
      "Paytas birthed baby Aquaman on July 12, and announced his name on July 22, the same day Osbourne died.",
      "Fans were quick to note the coincidence.",
      "The internet\u2019s tongue-in-cheek conspiracy is part of a longer-running meme tied to the YouTuber\u2019s pregnancies.",
      "Who Is Trisha Paytas, and Why Is She Famous?",
      "Paytas is a YouTuber, podcaster, and media personality. She has been married to photographer Moses Hacmon since 2021.",
      "She had a cameo on Saturday Night Live in December 2024, and made her Broadway debut in February of 2025 \u2014 and event that started out as a joke, but then became reality.",
      "The Trisha Paytas Baby Curse, Explained",
      "The Trisha Paytas baby curse theory first took hold on Sept. 7, 2022. At the time, Paytas was pregnant with her first child and announced on X that she was 1 centimeter dilated. The update coincided with news of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s declining health and the monarch\u2019s death one day later on Sept. 8, 2022.",
      "\u201cAnd Trisha Paytas is 1 cm dilated\u2026 the prophecy is being fulfilled,\u201d one person wrote of the timing.",
      "When Malibu Barbie was born one week later, fans latched onto the coincidence and sparked theories that Paytas\u2019s newborn daughter was the reincarnation of the British queen.",
      "Not long after Paytas announced that she was expecting her second child, King Charles III publicly revealed his cancer diagnosis. Fans quickly began to suggest that the monarch\u2019s fate might be entangled with Paytas\u2019 pregnancy.",
      "Since his announcement in 2024, Charles has continued to undergo medical treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer. While the king is very much alive, and not reincarnated in the form of Paytas\u2019 child, the conspiracy theory continued to grow.",
      "The beloved pope died on April 21, 2025, and fans quickly connected his fate to Paytas\u2019 pregnancy. While addressing the conspiracy theory that her third child will be Pope Francis reincarnated during her April 22 podcast, Paytas leaned into the meme and joked about the possibility of naming her baby Pope or Francis.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, I guess we\u2019re naming it Pope. It\u2019s not a bad name,\u201d she commented. \u201cTechnically, there (are) girls named Frances too. So we could have a girl Frances; yeah, my dad is, my dad\u2019s name is Francis.\u201d",
      "When the revered heavy metal musician died at age 76, fans were quick to connect the dots.",
      "The meme may be coming to a natural end, however, as Paytas has publicly declared she does not intend to have more children.",
      "\u201cI feel so good about the decision,\u201d Paytas said on her podcast."

      "The hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip has soared \u201calarmingly\u201d in recent weeks, health workers have warned, with a growing number of children dying of malnutrition while thousands of people across the besieged Palestinian enclave suffer from a dire lack of adequate food.",
      "\u201cEven we, the young ones, can barely walk due to lack of food,\u201d said Walid Abu Mohsen, a father of seven from Khan Younis. He told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground Sunday of his relief after plucking a sack of flour from the few trucks that arrived to offer relief to rushing crowds in the city. In another desperate corner of Gaza, footage captured the deadly aftermath after scores were killed waiting for supplies that might have let them feed their families.",
      "\u201cFamine is now striking Gaza alarmingly and terrifyingly,\u201d Dr. Mohammed Salmiya, director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told NBC News\u2019 crew as he warned of hospitals being \u201coverwhelmed with waves of patients suffering from malnutrition.\u201d",
      "He said that at least two children had died at Al-Shifa on Saturday alone.",
      "Nineteen deaths were recorded in Gaza due to malnutrition within the last 24 hours, the Palestinian Health Ministry in the territory said Monday. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm the figures.",
      "They add to more than 70 deaths related to malnutrition since the war began, according to Salmiya, with more than 50 children dying of malnutrition since Israel launched a blockade restricting aid into Gaza in early March, according to the World Health Organization."

    "story": [
      "SREBRENICA, Bosnia \u2014 Nedzad Avdic stood on a gravel plateau with four men and boys with their hands tied behind their backs, preparing for death. Just 17, Avdic had been captured by Bosnian Serb forces days earlier. Now, he stood yards from an execution squad.",
      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

    "summary": "A judgment by the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex came a blow to campaigners for trans rights.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

    "story": [
      "Standing around 10 feet tall, weighing around 220 pounds and with an axe-like beak capable of delivering devastating strikes, the terror bird would have proved a formidable foe for most creatures.",
      "But around 13 million years ago, one of them may have fallen prey to an even larger creature, a team of paleontologists in Colombia have discovered after examining bite marks in a fossilized bone of one of the fearsome birds.",
      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",
      "The lower part of the bird\u2019s left leg bone used in the study was unearthed in the renowned La Venta fossil beds of Colombia two decades ago by Cesar Perdomo, a local paleontologist."

      "Last week's incident was also not the first time Holy Family Church has come under attack. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem accused Israeli forces of fatally shooting a woman and her daughter as they walked inside its grounds in December 2023.",
      "Francis condemned the attack at the time. Israeli officials denied responsibility.",
      "The IDF sought to emphasize Wednesday that it had facilitated the transfer of aid to Holy Family Church, in addition to coordinating the visit of a delegation on behalf of the Greek and Latin patriarchs, who were accompanied by a group of Christian clergy. Pizzaballa was among those to make the rare and dangerous trip, with Israel having sealed off the enclave to visits from foreign officials.",
      "The IDF's completion of its probe and the release of its findings were markedly swift, with the military still to release the results of a growing number of investigations since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel launched its assault following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 59,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed."

    "summary": "MLB sees major growth opportunity in India for both fans and players, led by Blue Jays prospect Arjun Nimmala.",
    "story": [
      "Baseball is known as America\u2019s pastime, but it has long been a global game. From the Dominican Republic to Japan to Venezuela, the sport reigns supreme for fans, and countless players are on Major League Baseball rosters.",
      "The next country that could soon be on that list? India.",
      "While its residents may prefer a different game with a ball and a bat \u2014 cricket \u2014 it\u2019s also the motherland of Arjun Nimmala, the top prospect in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",
      "Two years later, he is ranked No. 46 out of 900 prospects by MLB and considered a future centerpiece of the organization.",
      "While Nimmala, currently with the Blue Jays\u2019 high-A affiliate Vancouver Canadians, continues to ascend the minor leagues, MLB is doing extensive outreach in India by putting together tournaments for children and taking baseball programs to schools.",
      "\u201cWe want to try to introduce the sport to as many kids as possible,\u201d Chris Marinak, MLB\u2019s chief operations and strategy officer, told NBC News. \u201cThat\u2019s the foot in the door. That\u2019s the way that you educate kids on the game \u2014 you get kids to fall in love with it, and they become fans for the rest of their lives.\u201d",
      "He said the goal is to take baseball to India both on the fields and inside homes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on getting our MLB games on broadcast and streaming,\u201d Marinak said. \u201cWe have two partners in India right now that are putting games live for the postseason and the regular season, and we\u2019re seeing great interest from fans around consumption.\u201d",
      "MLB opened an office in India in 2019 and since 2021 has hosted the MLB Cup, a tournament for amateur youth teams across the country.",
      "Nimmala traveled to India in 2023 to see the initiatives the league was producing and to help grow the game in the country where much of his family still lives.",
      "\u201cTo be able to go there and not only see that baseball is a part of India, as well, but just also trying to make it bigger, I think that makes me super proud,\u201d Nimmala said. \u201cKnowing that I have a possibility of doing that and just seeing how much baseball is played in India already, I thought was very cool.\u201d",
      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",
      "But the stats tell only one part of his story. By just being on the field, Nimmala is inspiring a whole new generation of Indian players.",
      "\u201cI do get a lot of messages, especially on Instagram, from younger kids that are Indian that start to play baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, I really look up to you.\u2019 I think it\u2019s super cool to see that.\u201d",
      "But even with all the responsibilities of being a trailblazer, he\u2019s keeping his eyes on the prize.",
      "\u201cI have 100% confidence that I will play with the Toronto Blue Jays one day and make an impact.\u201d"

      "Activists called for further protests Wednesday over a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that curbs the country's top two anti-corruption agencies. The move already fueled the first major demonstrations since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, and it drew alarm from European officials and experts.",
      "\u201cDestroy Russians, not democracy,\u201d one of the hastily drawn cardboard signs in Kyiv read, while crowds yelled \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cVeto the law!\u201d",

      "While details of the new bill haven\u2019t been made public, it appears to backtrack on the law that sparked the protests.",
      "Before Zelenskyy\u2019s announcement, Natalia, 48, a therapist who, like many in this febrile atmosphere, doesn\u2019t want to use her last name, said trying to restrict anti-corruption agencies risked \u201cendangering the values of freedom, democracy in our country and the future of our children.\u201d",

      "Many worried that the sudden crisis might have offered the Kremlin a powerful propaganda tool and could have threatened not just Ukraine\u2019s unity, but also its support from the West at a crucial moment in the war.",
      "Parliament had swiftly passed the controversial law giving Zelenskyy\u2019s prosecutor general sweeping powers over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office. He said he did that to make them more efficient and to clear out \u201cRussian influence,\u201d but critics feared it would further enhance the power of his divisive inner circle.",
      "It prompted howls of outrage and dismay, from not just Ukrainians themselves, but also Western officials and experts alarmed that the country could be backsliding on its endemic graft problem. It came a week after the arrest of a prominent anti-corruption campaigner who had embarrassed senior officials with investigations into their affairs.",
      "All of it overshadowed a third round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that began Wednesday in Istanbul.",
      "Though both sides remain pessimistic about serious progress, they are the first discussions since President Donald Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a truce or face new tariffs. Most observers expect another prisoner exchange but little else.",
      "Many Ukrainians are also worried that the country\u2019s opponents will weaponize Zelenskyy\u2019s move as evidence of the corruption that they say makes supporting Kyiv untenable.",
      "The head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, even appeared to question the move, warning that \u201cUkrainian history has taught us that a nation loses if it is torn apart by internal contradictions.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s endemic corruption is one of the reasons it hasn\u2019t been accepted into the European Union and NATO.",
      "Marta Kos, the E.U.\u2019s commissioner for enlargement, said she was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the new law, which she called a \u201cserious step back.\u201d",
      "Responding to the criticism Wednesday, Zelenskyy said: \u201cWe all share a common enemy: the Russian occupiers. And defending the Ukrainian state requires a strong enough law enforcement and anti-corruption system \u2014 one that ensures a real sense of justice.\u201d",
      "It also requires air defense against the nightly waves of drones launched by Russia.",

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

    "summary": "Organized crime is affecting hospitals in some Mexican states, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms and forcing doctors and personnel to treat the wounded.",
    "story": [
      "Despite all his years of experience and technical training, the doctor\u2019s voice trembled when he recalled how organized crime groups have taken control of emergency rooms and medical facilities in some parts of Mexico.",
      "\u201cThey force us to come in through threatening phone calls, in the early hours of the morning, and they tell us: \u2018We\u2019re just a few meters from where you live, and you\u2019re with your family. If you don\u2019t treat this person, we\u2019re going to pick you up right here,\u2019\u201d said the doctor, who works at a health center in Guanajuato, in central Mexico, and who requested complete anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "In many regions of Mexico, organized crime attacks have affected hospitals, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms, where hitmen kidnap medical personnel to force them to treat the wounded in the frequent clashes they wage with other cartels.",
      "The doctor interviewed by Noticias Telemundo in Guanajuato claimed that, on one occasion, he was contacted in the early hours by a high-ranking local drug operative, who made an unusual request.",
      "\u201cI received a call requesting treatment for a person who had been shot by a firearm. And they arrived at the main entrances of the hospitals with long guns, demanding treatment for their patient,\u201d the doctor said. On several occasions, the doctor said, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel forced him to use his equipment to treat hitmen.",
      "Noticias Telemundo confirmed that both the local boss and the hitman whose life was saved later died in a confrontation with the Mexican army. For the safety of the doctor interviewed in Guanajuato, their names are being withheld.",
      "According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, cartels and criminal groups continue to contribute to the high levels of violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cOrganized crime continues to be a key player in the lives of Mexicans. This is evident because some criminal groups have managed to force the Mexican state to lose control of certain territories, and because of the corruption and impunity that allow them to continue to reign and expand their capabilities,\u201d Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, co-director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "So far, official data shows that from September 2024 to April 2025, there was a 32.9% decrease in the daily average of intentional homicide victims, falling from 86.9 victims per day to 58.3.",
      "However, disappearances increased significantly: In the first 100 days of Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration, 4,010 disappearances were recorded, an average of 40 per day, compared with the figure of 25 recorded during the previous six-year term.",
      "\u201cThere are many missing people who, in reality, have already been kidnapped by drug traffickers and buried in so-called narco-graves,\u201d said David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Mexico City. \u201cThe cartels are hiding the bodies, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a reduction in homicides in several states across the country. But it\u2019s not that there are fewer deaths; there are fewer bodies. They\u2019re hiding the bodies,\u201d Saucedo asserted.",
      "'This shouldn't be normal'",
      "According to the latest report from the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the most (980 from January to April 2025). In February 2025, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety revealed that 87.5% of the population considered public safety to be the state\u2019s most serious problem.",
      "\u201cIn Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is fighting over drug trafficking with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and that\u2019s generating a lot of violence,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. \u201cThese organized crime groups are fighting for control of spaces because they need more street space, there are more feuds, and that\u2019s leading to more injuries and deaths, so they\u2019re taking control of medical centers.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited Guanajuato to document the case of a health center in the city of Celaya, where wounded drug traffickers were treated. According to a state intelligence report, until three years ago, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel used the San Ferm\u00edn Clinic to treat its wounded hitmen. However, in November 2022, gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel killed two men there and set fire to the now-abandoned facility.",
      "\u201cThe hospital where I work in Guanajuato isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s suffered this, nor am I the only doctor who\u2019s experienced this. We see in the news that these people are arriving at certain public hospitals,\u201d the Guanajuato doctor said, adding that \u201cI can say that more colleagues have experienced this. One lives with anxiety, and this shouldn\u2019t be normal for us.\u201d",
      "Due to the strong presence of criminal groups, the Guanajuato state police have implemented operations in clinics and hospitals in several municipalities of the state, to prevent drug cartels from continuing to infiltrate those places.",
      "\u201cWhen people injured with a firearm arrive, the prosecutor\u2019s office sends us a custody request. When these people arrive, we coordinate to provide security at the hospitals,\u201d said Bernardo Cajero, director of the Celaya police and in charge of these security operations.",
      "However, the Guanajuato doctor explained that although the Silver Code has been established in Mexico \u2014 a protocol that requires authorities to be notified when there are episodes of violence or when a person with a gunshot wound arrives at a health center \u2014\u00a0this is not always followed.",
      "\u201cThey come and take our cellphones, cut us off from communication, and start threatening us, saying that if they see anything strange, they could hurt us themselves,\u201d the doctor said, with fear in his voice. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re asking is that we not activate Code Silver and that we not notify the authorities.\u201d",
      "'It affects us all'",
      "Although there are no official figures on armed takeovers of health centers, the Guanajuato case is not unique in Mexico. In April 2024, a 10-person armed group entered a private medical center in Cuernavaca and shot and killed a patient in intensive care. In September, gunmen threatened staff at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mazatl\u00e1n with the phrase \u201cIf they die, you die,\u201d forcing them to care for their wounded. Two months later, two attacks were reported at the Culiac\u00e1n General Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhat the drug cartels do is take over hospitals, kidnap nurses, doctors, specialists, blood banks, operating rooms, and whatever else they need. They are hospital centers where the wounded are seen and treated, so they can return to their criminal activities,\u201d Saucedo said.",
      "In 2022, a report by Insecurity Insight for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition \u2014 a group of nongovernmental organizations focused on protecting health care \u2014 warned that Mexico had documented the most violent incidents against health care workers in Latin America: at that time, 14 recorded incidents, including three deaths, five kidnappings, two destroyed or damaged medical facilities and a damaged or looted  medical unit.",
      "\u201cBefore, they would leave their wounded in clinics, but then they would be finished off by rival groups,\u201d Saucedo said, \u201cnow, for added security, many drug trafficking groups are setting up private hospitals for themselves.\u201d",
      "Saucedo and other experts cited as examples of this trend the complaints about the hospital built by the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as   \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d and the mobile clinic set up by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.",
      "Researchers like Correa-Cabrera warn that these incidents also occur in other countries experiencing major security crises, such as Haiti, Ecuador and the Argentine city of Rosario, or in contexts of conventional warfare, such as the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Somalia and Libya, among others.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new; this is part of any armed conflict, low-intensity conflict, or war,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said, \u201cbecause health care for members of these warring groups is very important.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Guanajuato doctor says the tension generated by these incidents, in which armed groups enter hospitals, is sometimes so great that medical staff request vacation time and psychological support.",
      "\u201cThe first thing is to save that person\u2019s life, regardless of the situation or the accusations, because they are human beings,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut it affects us all; it can cause trauma. In fact, there were colleagues who asked for their leave, and anyone would do that. It\u2019s normal when you live with that every day.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"

      "For 21 months of war, the only Catholic church in Gaza has served as a fragile refuge in the besieged enclave, where hundreds of Christian and Muslim families took shelter from the Israeli assault outside its stone walls.",
      "The Israeli shelling that blasted through that sanctuary on Thursday \u2014 killing three, including the church\u2019s janitor, and wounding nine, including a priest \u2014 has seen Christians worldwide voice solidarity with their small community of fellow worshippers and drawn an unusually direct response from both the U.S. and the Vatican amid increasing global outrage.",
      "Pope Leo XIV spoke Sunday of his \"deep sorrow\" and called for an end to the \"barbarity of war,\" reading out the names of those killed at Holy Family Church.",
      "\u201cThis act, unfortunately, adds to the ongoing military attacks against the civilian population and places of worship in Gaza,\u201d he said, speaking after his Angelus prayer.",
      "Holy Family Church remains standing despite Thursday\u2019s deadly strike, which Israel said it \u201cdeeply regrets.\u201d",
      "Ornate crucifixes and paintings depicting the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ still adorn its walls. Amid the flickering candlelight, its shattered windows and scorched fa\u00e7ade attest to the strike."
